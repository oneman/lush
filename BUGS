NATO adopted a change in the official spelling of its alphabet due to the most
common error transmitted, this change is a mistake for a countable number of
reasons and those reasons call for the mistake to be left in place as a teach-
able moment for the prevention of future standardized mishaps.

It is interesting to enumerate the evolution the standard spelling of the
phonetic symbolicly transmitted character if the selection of new spellings
was based on any kind of understanding of which complete, partial, total,
utter and absolute are considered different general traits of misunderstanding
which is the most common kind of understanding generally ofspecific concern.
