EVALUATION

Abstract.
In
the
present
paper,
which
is
the
second
in
a
series
of
four
papers,
we
study
the
Kummer
theory
surrounding
the
Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic
evaluation
—
i.e.,
evaluation
in
the
style
of
the
scheme-theoretic
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
established
by
the
author
in
previous
papers
—
of
the
[reciprocal
of
the
lth
root
of
the]
theta
function
at
l-torsion
points
[strictly
speaking,
shifted
by
a
suitable
2-torsion
point],
for
l
≥
5
a
prime
number.
In
the
ﬁrst
paper
of
the
series,
we
studied
“miniature
models
of
conventional
scheme
theory”,
which
we
referred
to
as
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theaters,
that
were
associated
to
certain
data,
called
initial
Θ-data,
that
includes
an
elliptic
curve
EF
over
a
number
ﬁeld
F
,
together
with
a
prime
number
l
≥
5.
The
underlying
Θ-Hodge
theaters
of
these
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theaters
were
glued
to
one
another
by
means
of
“Θ-links”,
that
identify
the
[reciprocal
of
the
l-th
root
of
the]
theta
function
at
primes
of
bad
reduction
of
EF
in
one
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theater
with
[2l-th
roots
of]
the
q-parameter
at
primes
of
bad
reduction
of
EF
in
another
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theater.
The
theory
developed
in
the
present
paper
allows
one
×μ
to
construct
certain
new
versions
of
this
“Θ-link”.
One
such
new
version
is
the
Θgau
link,
which
is
similar
to
the
Θ-link,
but
involves
the
theta
values
at
l-torsion
points,
rather
than
the
theta
function
itself.
One
important
aspect
of
the
constructions
×μ
that
underlie
the
Θgau
-link
is
the
study
of
multiradiality
properties,
i.e.,
properties
of
the
“arithmetic
holomorphic
structure”
—
or,
more
concretely,
the
ring/scheme
structure
—
arising
from
one
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theater
that
may
be
formulated
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
sense
from
the
point
of
the
arithmetic
holomorphic
structure
of
another
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theater
which
is
related
to
the
original
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
×μ
theater
by
means
of
the
[non-scheme-theoretic!]
Θgau
-link.
For
instance,
certain
of
the
various
rigidity
properties
of
the
étale
theta
function
studied
in
an
earlier
paper
by
the
author
may
be
intepreted
as
multiradiality
properties
in
the
context
of
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers.
Another
important
aspect
of
the
constructions
×μ
that
underlie
the
Θgau
-link
is
the
study
of
“conjugate
synchronization”
via
the
-symmetry
of
a
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theater.
Conjugate
synchronization
refers
to
a
F±
l
certain
system
of
isomorphisms
—
which
are
free
of
any
conjugacy
indeterminacies!
—
between
copies
of
local
absolute
Galois
groups
at
the
various
l-torsion
points
at
which
the
theta
function
is
evaluated.
Conjugate
synchronization
plays
an
important
role
in
the
Kummer
theory
surrounding
the
evaluation
of
the
theta
function
at
l-torsion
points
and
is
applied
in
the
study
of
coricity
properties
of
[i.e.,
the
study
of
×μ
objects
left
invariant
by]
the
Θgau
-link.
Global
aspects
of
conjugate
synchronization
require
the
resolution,
via
results
obtained
in
the
ﬁrst
paper
of
the
series,
of
certain
technicalities
involving
proﬁnite
conjugates
of
tempered
cuspidal
inertia
groups.

of
the

to
the
ﬁrst

of

In
order
to
understand
the
signiﬁcance
of
Kummer
theory
in
the
context
of
Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic
evaluation,
it
is
important
to
recall
the
notions
of
“Frobenius-like”
and
“étale-like”
mathematical
structures
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],
§I1].
In
the
present
series
of
papers,
the
Frobenius-like
structures
constituted
by
[the
monoidal
portions
of]
Frobenioids
—
i.e.,
more
concretely,
by
various
monoids
—
play
the
important
role
of
allowing
one
to
construct
gluing
isomorphisms
such
as
the
Θ-link
which
lie
outside
the
framework
of
conventional
scheme/ring
theory
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],
§I2].
Such
gluing
isomorphisms
give
rise
to
Frobenius-pictures
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],
§I1].
On
the
other
hand,
the
étale-like
structures
constituted
by
various
Galois
and
arithmetic
fundamental
groups
give
rise
to
the
canonical
splittings
of
such
Frobeniuspictures
furnished
by
corresponding
étale-pictures
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],
§I1].
In
[IUTchIII],
absolute
anabelian
geometry
will
be
applied
to
these
Galois
and
arithmetic
fundamental
groups
to
obtain
descriptions
of
alien
arithmetic
holomorphic
structures,
i.e.,
arithmetic
holomorphic
structures
that
lie
on
the
opposite
side
of
a
Θ-link
from
a
given
arithmetic
holomorphic
structure
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],
§I3].
Thus,
in
light
of
the
equally
crucial
but
substantially
diﬀerent
roles
played
by
Frobenius-like
and
étale-like
structures
in
the
present
series
of
papers,
it
is
of
crucial
importance
to
be
able
to
relate
corresponding
Frobenius-like
and
étale-like
versions
of
various
objects
to
one
another.
This
is
the
role
played
by
Kummer
theory.
In
particular,
in
the
present
paper,
we
shall
study
in
detail
the
Kummer
theory
that
relates
Frobenius-like
and
étalelike
versions
of
the
theta
function
and
its
theta
values
at
l-torsion
points
to
one
another
[cf.
Fig.
I.1].
One
important
notion
in
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
is
the
notion
of
multiradiality.
To
understand
this
notion,
let
us
recall
the
étale-picture
discussed
in
[IUTchI],
§I1
[cf.
[IUTchI],
Fig.
I1.6].
In
the
context
of
the
present
paper,
we
shall
be
especially
interested
in
the
étale-like
version
of
the
theta
function
and
its
±ell
theta
values
constructed
in
each
D-Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theater
(−)
HT
D-Θ
NF
;
thus,
one
can
think
of
the
étale-picture
under
consideration
as
consisting
of
the
diagram
given
in
Fig.
I.2
below.
As
discussed
earlier,
we
shall
ultimately
be
interested
in
applying
various
absolute
anabelian
reconstruction
algorithms
to
the
various
arithmetic
fundamental
groups
that
[implicitly]
appear
in
such
étale-pictures
in
order
to
obtain
descriptions
of
alien
holomorphic
structures,
i.e.,
descriptions
of
objects
that
arise
on
one
“spoke”
[i.e.,
“arrow
emanating
from
the
core”]
that
make
sense
from
the
point
of
view
of
another
spoke.
In
this
context,
it
is
natural
to
classify
the
various
algorithms
applied
to
the
arithmetic
fundamental
groups
lying
in
a
given
spoke
as
follows
[cf.
Example
1.7]:
·
We
shall
refer
to
an
algorithm
as
coric
if
it
in
fact
only
depends
on
input
data
arising
from
the
mono-analytic
core
of
the
étale-picture,
i.e.,
the
data
that
is
common
to
all
spokes.

·
We
shall
refer
to
an
algorithm
as
uniradial
if
it
expresses
the
objects
constructed
from
the
given
spoke
in
terms
that
only
make
sense
within
the
given
spoke.
·
We
shall
refer
to
an
algorithm
as
multiradial
if
it
expresses
the
objects
constructed
from
the
given
spoke
in
terms
of
corically
constructed
objects,
i.e.,
objects
that
make
sense
from
the
point
of
view
of
other
spokes.
Thus,
multiradial
algorithms
are
compatible
with
simultaneous
execution
at
multiple
spokes
[cf.
Example
1.7,
(v);
Remark
1.9.1],
while
uniradial
algorithms
may
only
be
consistently
executed
at
a
single
spoke.
Ultimately,
in
the
present
series
of
papers,
we
shall
be
interested
—
relative
to
the
goal
of
obtaining
“descriptions
of
alien
holomorphic
structures”
—
in
the
establishment
of
multiradial
algorithms
for
constructing
the
objects
of
interest,
e.g.,
[in
the
context
of
the
present
paper]
the
étale-like
versions
of
the
theta
functions
and
the
corresponding
theta
values
discussed
above.
Typically,
in
order
to
obtain
such
multiradial
algorithms,
i.e.,
algorithms
that
make
sense
from
the
point
of
view
of
other
spokes,
it
is
necessary
to
allow
for
some
sort
of
“indeterminacy”
in
the
descriptions
that
appear
in
the
algorithms
of
the
objects
constructed
from
the
given
spoke.

Relative
to
the
analogy
between
the
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers
and
the
classical
theory
of
holomorphic
structures
on
Riemann
surfaces
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],
§I4],
one
may
think
of
coric
algorithms
as
corresponding
to
constructions
that
depend
only
on
the
underlying
real
analytic
structure
on
the
Riemann
surface.
Then
uniradial
algorithms
correspond
to
constructions
that
depend,
in
an
essential
way,
on
the
holomorphic
INTER-UNIVERSAL

structure
of
the
given
Riemann
surface,
while
multiradial
algorithms
correspond
to
constructions
of
holomorphic
objects
associated
to
the
Riemann
surface
which
are
expressed
[perhaps
by
allowing
for
certain
indeterminacies!]
solely
in
terms
of
the
underlying
real
analytic
structure
of
the
Riemann
surface
—
cf.
Fig.
I.3
below;
the
discussion
of
Remark
1.9.2.
Perhaps
the
most
fundamental
motivating
example
in
this
context
is
the
description
of
“alien
holomorphic
structures”
by
means
of
the
Teichmüller
deformations
reviewed
at
the
beginning
of
[IUTchI],
§I4,
relative
to
“unspeciﬁed/indeterminate”
deformation
data
[i.e.,
consisting
of
a
nonzero
square
diﬀerential
and
a
dilation
factor].
Indeed,
for
instance,
in
the
case
of
once-punctured
elliptic
curves,
by
applying
well-known
facts
concerning
Teichmüller
mappings
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Lehto],
Chapter
V,
Theorem
6.3],
it
is
not
diﬃcult
to
formulate
the
classical
result
that
“the
homotopy
class
of
every
orientation-preserving
homeomorphism
between
pointed
compact
Riemann
surfaces
of
genus
one
‘lifts’
to
a
unique
Teichmüller
mapping”
in
terms
of
the
“multiradial
formalism”
discussed
in
the
present
paper
[cf.
Example
1.7].

to

One
interesting
aspect
of
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers
may
be
seen
in
the
set-theoretic
function
arising
from
the

function

on

From
this
point
of
view,
the
passage
from

Frobeniuspicture
to
the
canonical
splittings
of
the
étale-picture
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],

SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
§I1],
i.e.,
in
eﬀect,
the
computation
of
the
Θ-links
that
occur
in
the
Frobeniuspicture
by
means
of
the
various
multiradial
algorithms
that
will
be
established
in
the
present
series
of
papers,
may
be
thought
of
[cf.
the
diagram
of
Fig.
I.2!]
as
a
sort
of
global
arithmetic/Galois-theoretic
analogue
of
the
computation
of
the
classical
Gaussian
integral

via
the
passage
from
cartesian
coordinates,
i.e.,
which
correspond
to
the
Frobeniuspicture,
to
polar
coordinates,
i.e.,
which
correspond
to
the
étale-picture
—
cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
1.12.5.
One
way
to
understand
the
diﬀerence
between
coricity,
multiradiality,
and
±
uniradiality
at
a
purely
combinatorial
level
is
by
considering
the
F
l
-
and
Fl
symmetries
discussed
in
[IUTchI],
§I1
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
4.7.4
of
the
present
paper].
Indeed,
at
a
purely
combinatorial
level,
the
F
l
-symmetry
may
be
thought
of
as
consisting
of
the
natural
action
of
F
on
the
set
of
labels
|Fl
|
=
l


{0}
Fl
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],
§I1].
Here,
the
label
0
corresponds
to
the
[mono-analytic]
core.
Thus,
the
corresponding
étale-picture
consists
of
various
copies
of
|Fl
|
glued
together
along
the
coric
label
0
[cf.
Fig.
I.4
below].
In
particular,
the
various
actions
of
copies
of
F
l
on
corresponding
copies
of
|Fl
|
are
“compatible
with
simultaneous
execution”
in
the
sense
that
they
commute
with
one
another.
That
is
to
say,
at
least
at
the
level
of
labels,
the
F
l
-symmetry
is
multiradial.

similar
vein,
at
a
purely
combinatorial
level,
the
F±
l
-symmetry
may
be
thought
±
of
as
consisting
of
the
natural
action
of
Fl
on
the
set
of
labels
Fl
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],
§I1].
Here
again,
the
label
0
corresponds
to
the
[mono-analytic]
core.
Thus,
the
corresponding
étale-picture
consists
of
various
copies
of
Fl
glued
together
along
the
coric
label
0
[cf.
Fig.
I.5
above].
In
particular,
the
various
actions
of
on
corresponding
copies
of
Fl
are
“incompatible
with
simultaneous
copies
of
F±
l
execution”
in
the
sense
that
they
clearly
fail
to
commute
with
one
another.
That
is
to
say,
at
least
at
the
level
of
labels,
the
F±
l
-symmetry
is
uniradial.
Since,
ultimately,
in
the
present
series
of
papers,
we
shall
be
interested
in
the
establishment
of
multiradial
algorithms,
“special
care”
will
be
necessary
in
order
to
obtain
multiradial
algorithms
for
constructing
objects
related
to
the
a
priori
uniradial
F±
l
-symmetry
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
4.7.3
of
the
present
paper;
[IUTchIII],
Remark
3.11.2,
(i),
(ii)].
The
multiradiality
of
such
algorithms
will
be
closely
related
to
the
fact
that
the
F±
l
-symmetry
is
applied
to
relate
the
various
copies
of
local
units
modulo
torsion,
i.e.,
“O×μ
”
[cf.
the
notation
of
[IUTchI],
§1]
at
various
labels
∈
Fl
that
lie
in
various
spokes
of
the
étale-picture
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
4.7.3,
(ii)].
This
contrasts
with
the
way
in
which
the
a
priori
multiradial
F
l
-symmetry
will
be
applied,
namely
to
treat
various
“weighted
volumes”
corresponding
to
the
local
value
groups
and
global
realiﬁed
Frobenioids
at
various
labels
∈
F
l
that
lie
in
various
spokes
of
the
étale-picture
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
4.7.3,
(iii)].
Relative
to
the
analogy
between
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers
and
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
[cf.
[IUTchI],
§I4],
various
aspects
of
the
F±
l
-symmetry
are
reminiscent
of
the
additive
monodromy
over
the
ordinary
locus
of
the
canonical
curves
that
occur
in
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory;
in
a
similar
vein,
various
aspects
of
the
F
l
-symmetry
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
the
multiplicative
monodromy
at
the
supersingular
points
of
the
canonical
curves
that
occur
in
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
—
cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
4.11.4,
(iii);
Fig.
I.7
below.
Before
discussing
the
theory
of
multiradiality
in
the
context
of
the
theory
of
Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic
evaluation
theory
developed
in
the
present
paper,
we
pause
to
review
the
theory
of
mono-theta
environments
developed
in
[EtTh].
One
starts
with
a
Tate
curve
over
a
mixed-characteristic
nonarchimedean
local
ﬁeld.
The
mono-theta
environment
associated
to
such
a
curve
is,
roughly
speaking,
the
Kummer-theoretic
data
that
arises
by
extracting
N
-th
roots
of
the
theta
trivialization
of
the
ample
line
bundle
associated
to
the
origin
over
suitable
tempered
coverings
of
the
curve
[cf.
[EtTh],
Deﬁnition
2.13,
(ii)].
Such
mono-theta
environments
may
be
constructed
purely
group-theoretically
from
the
[arithmetic]
tempered
fundamental
group
of
the
once-punctured
elliptic
curve
determined
by
the
given
Tate
curve
[cf.
[EtTh],
Corollary
2.18],
or,
alternatively,
purely
categorytheoretically
from
the
tempered
Frobenioid
determined
by
the
theory
of
line
bundles
and
divisors
over
tempered
coverings
of
the
Tate
curve
[cf.
[EtTh],
Theorem
5.10,
(iii)].
Indeed,
the
isomorphism
of
mono-theta
environments
between
the
monotheta
environments
arising
from
these
two
constructions
of
mono-theta
environments
—
i.e.,
from
tempered
fundamental
groups,
on
the
one
hand,
and
from
tempered
Frobenioids,
on
the
other
[cf.
Proposition
1.2
of
the
present
paper]
—
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
Kummer
isomorphism
for
mono-theta
environments
[cf.
Proposition
3.4
of
the
present
paper,
as
well
as
[IUTchIII],
Proposition
2.1,
(iii)].
One
important
consequence
of
the
theory
of
[EtTh]
asserts
that
mono-theta
8
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
environments
satisfy
the
following
three
rigidity
properties:
(a)
cyclotomic
rigidity,
(b)
discrete
rigidity,
and
(c)
constant
multiple
rigidity
—
cf.
the
Introduction
to
[EtTh].
Discrete
rigidity
assures
one
that
one
may
work
with
Z-translates
[where
we
write
Z
for
the
copy
of
“Z”
that
acts
as
a
group
of
covering
transformations
on
the
tempered
coverings
involved],
as
opposed
to
Z-translates
[i.e.,
where
Z
∼
=
Z
denotes
the
proﬁnite
completion
of
Z],
of
the
theta
function,
i.e.,
one
need
not
contend
with
Z-powers
of
canonical
multiplicative
coordinates
[i.e.,
“U
”],
or
q-parameters
[cf.
Remark
3.6.5,
(iii);
[IUTchIII],
Remark
2.1.1,
(v)].
Although
we
will
certainly
“use”
this
discrete
rigidity
throughout
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers,
this
property
of
mono-theta
environments
will
not
play
a
particularly
prominent
role
in
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers.
The
Z-powers
of
“U
”
and
“q”
that
would
occur
if
one
does
not
have
discrete
rigidity
may
be
compared
to
the
PDformal
series
that
are
obtained,
a
priori,
if
one
attempts
to
construct
the
canonical
parameters
of
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
via
formal
integration.
Indeed,
PD-formal
power
series
become
necessary
if
one
attempts
to
treat
such
canonical
parameters
as
objects
which
admit
arbitrary
O-powers,
where
O
denotes
the
completion
of
the
local
ring
to
which
the
canonical
parameter
belongs
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
3.6.5,
(iii);
Fig.
I.6
below].
Constant
multiple
rigidity
plays
a
somewhat
more
central
role
in
the
present
series
of
papers,
in
particular
in
relation
to
the
theory
of
the
log-link,
which
we
shall
discuss
in
[IUTchIII]
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
1.12.2
of
the
present
paper;
[IUTchIII],
Remark
1.2.3,
(i);
[IUTchIII],
Proposition
3.5,
(ii);
[IUTchIII],
Remark
3.11.2,
(iii)].
Constant
multiple
rigidity
asserts
that
the
multiplicative
monoid
OF×
·
ΘN

v
—
which
we
shall
refer
to
as
the
theta

—
generated
by
the
reciprocal
of
the
l-th

of
the
theta
function
and
the
group
of
units
of
the
ring
of
integers
of
the
base
ﬁeld
F
v
[cf.
the
notation
of
[IUTchI],
§I1]
admits
a
canonical
splitting,
up
to
2l-th
roots
of
unity,
that
arises
from
evaluation
at
the
[2-]torsion
point
corresponding
to
the
label
0
∈
Fl
[cf.
Corollary
1.12,
(ii);
Proposition
3.1,
(i);
Proposition
3.3,
(i)].
Put
another
way,
this
canonical
splitting
is
the
splitting
.

up
to

as
the
associated
canonical
splitting,
may
be
constructed
algorithmically

the

3.1,

Relative

the

between
the

these

which
we
refer
to
as
the

—
that
arises
from
the
roots
of
unity
of
the

and
·
a

[cf.

1.1.1;
Proposition
1.3,

This
rigidity
is
remarkable
—
as
we
shall
see
in
our
discussion
below
of
the
corresponding
multiradiality
10
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
property
—
in
that
unlike
the
“conventional”
construction
of
such
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphisms
via
local
class
ﬁeld
theory
[cf.
Proposition
1.3,
(ii)],
which
requires
one
to
use
the
entire
monoid
with
Galois
action
Gv

OF
,
the
only
portion
of
v
the
monoid
OF
that
appears
in
this
construction
is
the
portion
[i.e.,
the
“exterior

cyclotome”]
corresponding
to
the
torsion
subgroup
OFμ
v
⊆
OF
[cf.
the
notation
v
of
[IUTchI],
§I1].
This
construction
depends,
in
an
essential
way,
on
the
commutator
structure
of
theta
groups,
but
constitutes
a
somewhat
diﬀerent
approach
to
utilizing
this
commutator
structure
from
the
“classical
approach”
involving
irreducibility
of
representations
of
theta
groups
[cf.
Remark
3.6.5,
(ii);
the
Introduction
to
[EtTh]].
One
important
aspect
of
this
dependence
on
the
commutator
structure
of
the
theta
group
is
that
the
theory
of
cyclotomic
rigidity
yields
an
explanation
for
the
importance
of
the
special
role
played
by
the
ﬁrst
power
of
[the
reciprocal
of
the
l-th
root
of
]
the
theta
function
in
the
present
series
of
papers
[cf.
Remark
3.6.4,
(iii),
(iv),
(v);
the
Introduction
to
[EtTh]].
Relative
to
the
analogy
between
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers
and
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory,
monotheta-theoretic
cyclotomic
rigidity
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
either
to
the
fact
that
the
canonical
coordinates
of
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
are
completely
determined
without
any
Z×
-power
indeterminacies
or
[roughly
equivalently]
to
the
Kodaira-Spencer
isomorphism
of
the
canonical
indigenous
bundle
—
cf.
Fig.

both
étale-like

may
be

to
one
another
via
a

[cf.
Proposition
3.3,

up

[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],
§I1;
[IUTchI],
Theorem
A,
(ii)].
In
the
theory
of
the
present
paper,
we
shall
introduce
modiﬁed
versions
of
the
Θ-link
of
[IUTchI]
[cf.
the
discussion
of
the
“Θ×μ
-,
Θ×μ
gau
-links”
below],
which,
unlike
the
Θ-link
of
[IUTchI],
only
preserve
[up
to
isomorphism]
the
F

—
i.e.,
which
consist
of
the
data

preserved
[up

isomorphism]
by
the
Θ-link
of
[IUTchI].
Since
this
data
is
only
preserved
up

isomorphism,
it
follows
that
the
topological
group
“Gv

must
be
regarded
as

the

is
to

These
indeterminacies
will
play
an
important
role
in
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers
—
cf.
the
indeterminacies
“(Ind1)”,
“(Ind2)”
of
[IUTchIII],
Theorem
3.11,
(i).
Now
let
us
return
to
our
discussion
of
the
various
mono-theta-theoretic
rigidity
properties.
The
key
observation
concerning
these
rigidity
properties,
as
reviewed
above,
in
the
context
of
the
Aut(Gv
)-,
Z×
-indeterminacies
just
discussed,
is
the
following:
the
canonical
splittings,
via
“evaluation
at
the
zero
section”,
of
the
theta
monoids,
together
with
the
construction
of
the
mono-theta-theoretic
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphism,
are
compatible
with,
in
the
sense
that
they
are
left
unchanged
by,
the
Aut(Gv
)-,
Z×
-indeterminacies
discussed
above
—
cf.
Corollaries
1.10,
1.12;
Proposition
3.4,
(i).
Indeed,
this
observation
constitutes
the
substantive
content
of
the
multiradiality
of
mono-theta-theoretic
constant
multiple/cyclotomic
rigidity
[cf.
Fig.
I.6]
and
will
play
an
important
role
in
the
statements
and
proofs
of
the
main
results
of
the
present
series
of
papers
[cf.
[IUTchIII],
Theorem
2.2;
[IUTchIII],
Corollary
2.3;
[IUTchIII],
Theorem
3.11,
(iii),
(c);
Step
(ii)
of
the
proof
of
[IUTchIII],
Corollary
3.12].
At
a
technical
level,
this
“key
observation”
simply
amounts
to
the
observation
that
the
only
portion
of
the
monoid
OF×
that
is
relevant
to
the
construction
of
the
canonical
splittings
and
v
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphism
under
consideration
is
the
torsion
subgroup
OFμ
,
v
which
[by
deﬁnition!]
maps
to
the
identity
element
of
OF×μ
,
hence
is
immune
to
v
the
various
indeterminacies
under
consideration.
That
is
to
say,
the
multiradiality
of
mono-theta-theoretic
constant
multiple/cyclotomic
rigidity
may
be
regarded
as
an
essentially
formal
consequence
of
the
triviality
of
the
natural
homomorphism
OFμ
v
OF×μ
→
v
[cf.
Remark
1.10.2].
After
discussing,
in
§1,
the
multiradiality
theory
surrounding
the
various
rigidity
properties
of
the
mono-theta
environment,
we
take
up
the
task,
in
§2
and
§3,
of
establishing
the
theory
of
Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic
evaluation,
i.e.,
of
passing

as
discussed

[i.e.,

display]
to
Gaussian
monoids
[i.e.,
the
monoids
on
the
right-hand
side
of

above
display]
by
means
of
the
operation
of
“evaluation”
at
l-torsion

Just
as
in
the
case
of
theta
monoids,
Gaussian
monoids
admit
both
étale-like
versions,
which
constitute
the
main
topic
of
§2,
and
Frobenius-like
[i.e.,
Frobenioidtheoretic]
versions,
which
constitute
the
main
topic
of
§3.
Moreover,
as
discussed
at
the
beginning
of
the
present
Introduction,
it
is
of
crucial
importance
in
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers
to
be
able
to
relate
these
étale-like
and
Frobenius-like
versions
to
one
another
via
Kummer
theory.
One
important
observation
in
this
12
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
context
—
which
we
shall
refer
to
as
the
“principle
of
Galois
evaluation”
—
is
the
following:
it
is
essentially
a
tautology
that
this
requirement
of
compatibility
with
Kummer
theory
forces
any
sort
of
“evaluation
operation”
to
arise
from
restriction
to
Galois
sections
of
the
[arithmetic]
tempered
fundamental
groups
involved
[i.e.,
Galois
sections
of
the
sort
that
arise
from
rational
points
such
as
l-torsion
points!]
—
cf.
the
discussion
of
Remarks
1.12.4,
3.6.2.
This
tautology
is
interesting
both
in
light
of
the
history
surrounding
the
Section
Conjecture
in
anabelian
geometry
[cf.
[IUTchI],
§I5]
and
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
theory
of
[SemiAnbd]
that
is
applied
to
prove
[IUTchI],
Theorem
B
—
a
result
which
plays
an
important
role
in
the
theory
of
§2
of
the
present
paper!
[cf.
the
discussion
below]
—
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“Combinatorial
Section
Conjecture”.
At
this
point,
we
remark
that,
unlike
the
theory
of
theta
monoids
discussed
above,
the
theory
of
Gaussian
monoids
developed
in
the
present
paper
does
not,
by
itself,
admit
a
multiradial
formulation
[cf.
Remarks
2.9.1,
(iii);
3.4.1,
(ii);
3.7.1].
In
order
to
obtain
a
multiradial
formulation
of
the
theory
of
Gaussian
monoids
—
which
is,
in
some
sense,
the
ultimate
goal
of
the
present
series
of
papers!
—
it
will
be
necessary
to
combine
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
with
the
theory
of
the
log-link
developed
in
[IUTchIII].
This
will
allow
us
to
obtain
a
multiradial
formulation
of
the
theory
of
Gaussian
monoids
in
[IUTchIII],
Theorem
3.11.
One
important
aspect
of
the
theory
of
Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic
evaluation
is
the
notion
of
conjugate
synchronization.
Conjugate
synchronization
refers
to
a
collection
of
“symmetrizing
isomorphisms”
between
the
various
copies
of
the
local
absolute
Galois
group
Gv
associated
to
the
labels
∈
Fl
at
which
one
evaluates
the
theta
function
[cf.
Corollaries
3.5,
(i);
3.6,
(i);
4.5,
(iii);
4.6,
(iii)].
We
shall
also
use
the
term
“conjugate
synchronization”
to
refer
to
similar
collections
of
“symmetrizing
isomorphisms”
for
copies
of
various
objects
[such
as
the
monoid
OF
]
v
closely
related
to
the
absolute
Galois
group
Gv
.
With
regard
to
the
collections
of
isomorphisms
between
copies
of
Gv
,
it
is
of
crucial
importance
that
these
isomorphisms
be
completely
well-deﬁned,
i.e.,
without
any
conjugacy
indeterminacies!
Indeed,
if
one
allows
conjugacy
indeterminacies
[i.e.,
put
another
way,
if
one
allows
oneself
to
work
with
outer
isomorphisms,
as
opposed
to
isomorphisms],
then
one
must
sacriﬁce
either
·
the
distinct
nature
of
distinct
labels
∈
|Fl
|
—
which
is
necessary
in
j2
order
to
keep
track
of
the
distinct
theta
values
“q
”
for
distinct
j
—
or
·
the
crucial
compatibility
of
étale-like
and
Frobenius-like
versions
of
the
symmetrizing
isomorphisms
with
Kummer
theory
—
cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
3.8.3,
(ii);
[IUTchIII],
Remark
1.5.1;
Step
(vii)
of
the
proof
of
[IUTchIII],
Corollary
3.12.
In
this
context,
it
is
also
of
interest
to
observe
that
it
follows
from
certain
elementary
combinatorial
considerations
that
one
must
require
that
INTER-UNIVERSAL

·
these
symmetrizing
isomorphisms
arise
from
a
group
action,
i.e.,
such
as
the
F±
l
-symmetry
—
cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
3.5.2.
Moreover,
since
it
will
be
of
crucial
importance
to
apply
these
symmetrizing
isomorphisms,
in
[IUTchIII],
§1
[cf.,
especially,
[IUTchIII],
Remark
1.3.2],
in
the
context
of
the
log-link
—
whose
deﬁnition
depends
on
the
local
ring
structures
at
v
∈
Vbad
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[AbsTopIII],
§I3]
—
it
will
be
necessary
to
invoke
the
fact
that
·
the
symmetrizing
isomorphisms
at
v
∈
Vbad
arise
from
conjugation
operations
within
a
certain
[arithmetic]
tempered
fundamental
group
—
namely,
the
tempered
fundamental
group
of
X
v
[cf.
the
notation
of
[IUTchI],
§I1]
—
that
contains
Πv
as
an
open
subgroup
of
ﬁnite
index
—
cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
3.8.3,
(ii).
Here,
we
note
that
these
“conjugation
operations”
related
to
the
F±
l
-symmetry
may
be
applied
to
establish
conjugate
synchronization
precisely
because
they
arise
from
conjugation
by
elements
of
the
geometric
tempered
fundamental
group
[cf.
Remark
3.5.2,
(iii)].
The
signiﬁcance
of
establishing
conjugate
synchronization
—
i.e.,
subject
to
the
various
requirements
discussed
above!
—
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
resulting
symmetrizing
isomorphisms
allow
one
to
construct
the
crucial
coric
F
×μ
-prime-strips
—
i.e.,
the
F
×μ
-prime-strips
that
are
preserved,
up
to
isomorphism,
by
the
modiﬁed
versions
of
the
Θ-link
of
[IUTchI]
[cf.
the
discussion
of
the
“Θ×μ
-,
Θ×μ
gau
-links”
below]
that
are
introduced
in
§4
of
the
present
paper
[cf.
Corollary
4.10,
(i),
(iv);
[IUTchIII],
Theorem
1.5,
(iii);
the
discussion
of
[IUTchIII],
Remark
1.5.1,
(i)].
In
§4,
the
theory
of
conjugate
synchronization
established
in
§3
[cf.
Corollaries
3.5,
(i);
3.6,
(i)]
is
extended
so
as
to
apply
to
arbitrary
v
∈
V,
i.e.,
not
just
v
∈
Vbad
[cf.
Corollaries
4.5,
(iii);
4.6,
(iii)].
In
particular,
in
order
to
work
with
the
theta
value
labels

Fl
in
the
context
of
the
F±
l
-symmetry,
i.e.,
which
involves
the

the

∈
Fl
,
one
must
avail
oneself
of
the
global
portion
of
the
Θ±ell

that
appear.
Indeed,
this
global

allows

to

On

the
copy
of
the
arithmetic
fundamental
group
of
X
K
that
constitutes
this
global
portion
of
the
Θ±ell

theater
is
proﬁnite,
i.e.,
it
does
not
admit
a
“globally
tempered
version”
whose
localization
at
v
∈
Vbad
is
naturally
isomorphic
to
the
corresponding
tempered
fundamental
group
at
v.
One
important
consequence
of
this

of
aﬀairs
is
that

—
cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],
Remark
4.5.1,
as
well
as
Remarks
2.5.2
and
4.5.3,
(iii),
of
the
present
paper,
for
more
details.
This
is
precisely
what
is
achieved
by
the
application
of
[IUTchI],
Theorem
B
[i.e.,
in
the
form
of
[IUTchI],
Corollary
2.5;
cf.
also
[IUTchI],
Remark
2.5.2]
in
§2
of
the
present
paper.
As
discussed
above,
the
theory
of
Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic
evaluation
developed
in
§1,
§2,
§3
is
strictly
local
[at
v
∈
Vbad
]
in
nature.
Thus,
in
§4,
we
discuss
the
essentially
routine
extensions
of
this
theory,
e.g.,
of
the
theory
of
Gaussian
monoids,
to
the
“remaining
portion”
of
the
Θ±ell
-Hodge
theater,
i.e.,
to
v
∈
Vgood
,
as
well
as
to
the
case
of
global
realiﬁed
Frobenioids
[cf.
Corollaries
4.5,
(iv),
(v);
4.6,
(iv),
(v)].
We
also
discuss
the
corresponding
complements,
involving
the
theory
of
[IUTchI],
§5,
for
ΘNF-Hodge
theaters
[cf.
Corollaries
4.7,
4.8].
This
leads
naturally
to
the
construction
of
modiﬁed
versions
of
the
Θ-link
of
[IUTchI]
[cf.
Corollary
4.10,
(iii)].
These
modiﬁed
versions
may
be
described
as
follows:
·
The
Θ×μ
-link
is
essentially
the
same
as
the
Θ-link
of
[IUTchI],
Theorem
A,
except
that
F

-prime-strips
are
replaced
by
F
×μ
-prime-strips
[cf.
[IUTchI],
Fig.
I1.2]
—
i.e.,
roughly
speaking,
the
various
local
“O×
”
are
replaced
by
“O×μ
=
O×
/Oμ
”.
×μ
-link,
except
that
the
·
The
Θ×μ
gau
-link
is
essentially
the
same
as
the
Θ
×μ
theta
monoids
that
give
rise
to
the
Θ
-link
are
replaced,
via
composition
with
a
certain
isomorphism
that
arises
from
Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic
evaluation,
by
Gaussian
monoids
[cf.
the
above
discussion!]
—
i.e.,
roughly
j2
speaking,
the
various
“Θv
”
at
v
∈
Vbad
are
replaced
by
“{q
}j=1,...,l
”.
v
The
basic
properties
of
the
Θ×μ
-,
Θ×μ
gau
-links,
including
the
corresponding
Frobeniusand
étale-pictures,
are
summarized
in
Theorems
A,
B
below
[cf.
Corollaries
4.10,
4.11
for
more
details].
Relative
to
the
analogy
between
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers
and
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory,
the
passage
from
the
Θ×μ
-link
to
the
Θ×μ
gau
-link
via
Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic
evaluation
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
the
passage

Galois
representations
in
the
case
of
the

that
occur
in

theory
—
cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
4.11.4,
(ii),
(iii).
In
particular,
the
corresponding
passage
from
the
Frobenius-picture
associated
to
the
Θ×μ
-link
to
the
Frobenius-picture
associated
to
the
Θ×μ
gau
-link
—
or,
more
properly,
relative
to
the
point
of
view
of
[IUTchIII]
[cf.
also
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],
§I4],
from
the
log-theta-lattice
arising
from
the
Θ×μ
-link
to
the
log-theta-lattice
arising
from
the
Θ×μ
gau

—
corresponds
[i.e..,
relative
to
the
analogy
with
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory]
to
the
passage
from

In

it

in

Finally,
we
observe
that
from
this
point
of
view,
the
important
theory
of
conjugate
synchronization
via
the
F±

may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding

Certain
aspects
of
the
various

summarized
in
the
following
two

Theorems

On

many
important

—
such
as
multiradiality!
—
of
these

do
not
appear
explicitly
in
Theorems

The
main
reason
for
this
is
that
it
is
diﬃcult
to
formulate
“ﬁnal
results”
concerning
such
aspects
as
multiradiality
in
the
absence
of
the

[cf.

If

as

[cf.

Thus,
each

be
thought
of
as

Finally,
[cf.

SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
Section
1:
Multiradial
Mono-theta
Environments
In
the
present
§1,
we
review
the
theory
of
mono-theta
environments
developed
in
[EtTh]
and
give
a
“multiradial”
interpretation
of
this
theory,
which
will
be
of
substantial
importance
in
the
present
series
of
papers.
Roughly
speaking,
in
the
language
of
[AbsTopIII],
§I3,
this
interpretation
consists
of
the
computation
of
which
portion
of
the
various
objects
constructed
from
the
“arithmetic
holomorphic
structures”
of
various
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theaters
may
be
glued
together,
in
a
fashion
consistent
with
the
constructions
of
the
objects
of
interest,
via
a
“mono-analytic”
[i.e.,
“arithmetic
real
analytic”]
core.
Put
another
way,
this
computation
may
be
thought
of
as
the
computation
of
what
one
arithmetic
holomorphic
structure
looks
like
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
distinct
arithmetic
holomorphic
structure
that
is
only
related
to
the
original
arithmetic
holomorphic
structure
via
the
mono-analytic
core.
In
fact,
this
sort
of
computation
forms
one
of
the
central
themes
of
the
present
series
of
papers.

Remark
1.1.1.
In
light
of
its
importance
in

we
pause
to
review
the
mono-theta-theoretic
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphism
of
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(ii),
in
more
detail,
as
follows.
(i)
First,
we
recall
from
[EtTh],
Proposition
2.4
[cf.
also
the
construction
of
the
covering
“Y
log
→
X
log
”
at
the
beginning
of
[EtTh],
§1],
that
the
topological
group
ΠX
(MΘ
)
determines
topological
groups
ΠY
(MΘ
),
ΠX
(MΘ
),
and
ΠC
(MΘ
)
—
i.e.,
corresponding
to
the
coverings
“Y
log
→
X
log
→
C
log
”
of
the
discussion
preceding
[EtTh],
Deﬁnition
2.7
—
all
of
which
[together
with
ΠX
(MΘ
)]
may
be
regarded
as
open
subgroups
of
ΠC
(MΘ
)
ΠY
(MΘ
)
⊆
ΠX
(MΘ
)
⊆
ΠC
(MΘ
)
(⊇
ΠX
(MΘ
)
⊇
ΠX
(MΘ

that
are
equipped
with
compatible
surjections
to
G(MΘ
).
Write
ΔY
(MΘ
)
⊆
ΔX
(MΘ
)
⊆
ΔC
(MΘ
)
(⊇
ΔX
(MΘ
)
⊇
ΔX
(MΘ
))
for
the
respective
kernels
of
these
surjections.
Moreover,
the
various
topological
groups
of
the
above
two
displays
are
equipped
with
subquotients
denoted
by
means
22
SHINICHI

of
a
superscript
“Θ”
or
a
superscript
“ell”
[cf.
the
discussion
at
the
beginning
of
[EtTh],
§1].
These
subquotients
are
completely
determined
by
the
topological
group
structure
of
ΠC
(MΘ
)
[cf.
the
discussion
at
the
beginning
of
[EtTh],
§1;
the
proof
of
[EtTh],
Proposition
1.8].
For
instance,
we
observe
that
one
may
reconstruct
from
the
topological
group
ΠX
(MΘ
)
[cf.
[EtTh],
Corollary
2.18,
(i)]
the
quotient

corresponding
to
the
quotient
“Πtp

(ΠY

”
of
the
discussion
at
the

of
[EtTh],
§1.
(ii)
Observe
that
any
closed

H

ΠY
(MΘ

determines,
by
forming
the

image
via
the
quotient
ΠMΘ

ΠY
(MΘ
),
a
closed
subgroup
ΠMΘ
|H

ΠMΘ
.
On
the
other
hand,
by
forming
the
quotient
of
ΠMΘ
by
the
restriction
of
the
“theta

portion”
of
the
mono-theta

(c)]
to
the
subgroup
Ker(ΠY
(MΘ
)

ΠΘ

⊆
ΠY
(M
),
it
makes
sense
to
speak
of
the
quotient
of
ΠMΘ
(ΠMΘ

the

In
particular,

(iv)
Next,
we
observe
that
the
mono-theta-theoretic
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphism
of
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(ii),
admits
a
certain
symmetry
with
respect
to
the
group
ΔC
(MΘ
)/ΔX
(MΘ
)
∼
[cf.
[IUTchI],
Deﬁnition
6.1,
(v)],
as
follows.
First
of
all,
=
F±
l
let
us
observe
that
the
natural
conjugation
action
of
ΠY
(MΘ
)
on
ΠMΘ
|(l·ΔΘ
)(MΘ
)
factors
through
the
natural
surjection
ΠY
(MΘ
)

G(MΘ
).
In
particular,
by
applying
the
natural
surjection
ΠC
(MΘ
)

G(MΘ
),
one
may
regard
ΠMΘ
|(l·ΔΘ
)(MΘ
)
as
being
equipped
with
a
“naively
deﬁned”
action
by
ΠC
(MΘ
).
On
the
other
hand,
let
us
recall
from
the
discussion
preceding
[EtTh],
Deﬁnition
2.13,
that
the
“model”
for
ΠMΘ
is
originally
constructed
as
the
subgroup
Πμ
(MΘ
)

ΠY
(MΘ
)
⊆
Πμ
(MΘ
)

ΠC
(MΘ
)
—
where
the
semi-direct
products
are
formed
relative
to
the
natural
cyclotomic
action
of
ΠC
(MΘ
).
Here,
the
evident
subquotient
Πμ
(MΘ
)

(l
·
ΔΘ
)(MΘ
)
of
Πμ
(MΘ
)

ΠC
(MΘ
)
—
i.e.,
which
corresponds
to
the
subquotient
ΠMΘ
|(l·ΔΘ
)(MΘ
)
of
ΠMΘ
—
is
easily
veriﬁed
to
be
stabilized
by
the
action
via
conjugation
of
Πμ
(MΘ
)

ΠC
(MΘ
).
Moreover,
one
veriﬁes
easily
that
this
conjugation
action
of
Πμ
(MΘ
)

ΠC
(MΘ
)
factors
through
the
natural
quotient
Πμ
(MΘ
)

ΠC
(MΘ
)

ΠC
(MΘ
)

G(MΘ
)
and
coincides
with
the
action
of
G(MΘ
)
via
the
cyclotomic
character
G(MΘ
)
→
Z×
on
the
abelian
proﬁnite
group
Πμ
(MΘ
)

(l
·
ΔΘ
)(MΘ
)
[where
we
recall
that
Z×
acts
tautologically
on
any
abelian
proﬁnite
group].
That
is
to
say,
in
summary,
even
if
one
is
not
equipped
with
the
“model
embedding”
ΠMΘ
→
Πμ
(MΘ
)

ΠC
(MΘ
),
the
“naively
deﬁned”
action
of
ΠC
(MΘ
)
on
ΠMΘ
|(l·ΔΘ
)(MΘ
)
is
in
fact
a
“natural
action”
in
the
sense
that
it
necessarily
coincides
with
the
natural
conjugation
action
arising
from
this
“model
embedding”.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
the
inclusion
ΔX
(MΘ
)
⊆
ΔX
(MΘ
)
induces
natural
isomorphisms
∼
ΔX
(MΘ
)/ΔY
(MΘ
)
→
ΔX
(MΘ
)/ΔY
(MΘ
),
∼
Θ
ell
Θ
Δell
Y
(M
)
→
ΔY
(M
)
of
subquotients
of
ΠC
(MΘ
),
whose
codomains
are
[unlike
the
domains
of
these
isomorphisms!]
stabilized
by
the
conjugation
action
of
ΠC
(MΘ
).
In
particular,
by
applying
these
natural
isomorphisms,
one
may
regard
the
“commutator
map”
of
(iii)
as
a
map
Θ
[−,
−]
:
(ΔX
(MΘ
)/ΔY
(MΘ
))
×
Δell
Y
(M
)
→
ΠMΘ
|(l·ΔΘ
)(MΘ
)
—
i.e.,
a
map
for
which
both
the
domain
and
the
codomain
are
equipped
with
natural
actions
by
ΠC
(MΘ
).
Now
one
veriﬁes
easily
that
this
“commutator
map”
is
equivariant
with
respect
to
these
natural
actions
by
ΠC
(MΘ
),
and,
24
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
moreover,
that
the
various
subgroups
of
ΠMΘ
|(l·ΔΘ
)(MΘ
)
constructed
in
(iii)
are
stabilized
by
the
natural
action
by
ΠC
(MΘ
).
In
this
context,
it
is
also
of
interest
to
note
that,
in
fact,
it
follows
immediately
from
a
similar
argument
to
the
argument
concerning
the
automorphisms
of
a
mono-theta
environment
given
in
the
proof
of
[EtTh],
Corollary
2.18,
(iv),
that
up
to
composition
with
automorphisms
of
ΠMΘ

diﬀer
from
the

by
a
twisted

ΠMΘ


Πell

(M
)
→
Πμ
(M

that
arises
from
a
Kummer

class
of
a
product
of
integral
powers
of
“(Ü
)2
”
and
“qX2
”
[cf.
[EtTh],
Proposition
1.4,
(ii)]
—
i.e.,
automorphisms
that
have
no
eﬀect
on
the
construction
of
the
“commutator
map”
of
the
above
display!
—
the
“model
embedding”
ΠMΘ
→
Πμ
(MΘ
)

ΠC
(MΘ
)
may
be
reconstructed
algorithmically
from
the
mono-theta
environment
MΘ
.
Thus,
in
summary,
the
various
constructions
discussed
in
(iii)
that
underlie
the
mono-thetatheoretic
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphism
of
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(ii),
are
stabilized
by
the
natural
action
by
ΠC
(MΘ
),
hence,
in
particular,
by
the
natural
action
by
(ΠC
(MΘ
)
⊇)
ΔC
(MΘ
)

ΔC
(MΘ
)/ΔX
(MΘ
)
∼
=
F±
l
.
Here,
we
remark
that
the
fact
that
these
constructions
are
stabilized
by
the
action
of
ΔX
(MΘ
)
is
“less
interesting”
in
the
sense
that
the
automorphisms
of
ΠX
(MΘ
)
that
arise
from
the
conjugation
action
by
ΔX
(MΘ
)
lift
[indeed,
“almost
uniquely”!
—
cf.
[EtTh],
Corollary
2.18,
(iv)]
to
automorphisms
of
MΘ
,
hence
stabilize
the
constructions
under
consideration
as
a
consequence
of
the
functoriality
of
these
constructions
with
respect
to
automorphisms
[cf.
[EtTh],
Corollary
2.19,
(i)].
It
is
for
this
reason
that,
in
the
present
context,
it
is
natural
to
regard
the
symmetry
properties
of
interest
as
being
symmetries
with
respect
to
the
quotient
ΔC
(MΘ
)

ΔC
(MΘ
)/ΔX
(MΘ
)
∼
=
F±
l
.
On
the
other
hand,
the
approach
of
the
above
discussion
via
model
embeddings
to
this
full
symmetry
with
respect
to
F±
l
may
also
be
regarded
as
being
simply
an
explicit
computation,
in
the
case
of
this
F±
l
-symmetry,
of
the
functoriality
of
the
constructions
under
consideration
with
respect
to
isomorphisms
[cf.
[EtTh],
Corollary
2.19,
(i)].
(v)
In
the
context
of
the
discussion
following
the
ﬁnal
display
of
(iv),
it
is
perhaps
of
interest
to
recall
that
the
symmetries
of
mono-theta
environments
relative
to
the
conjugation
action
by
ΔX
(MΘ
)
are
a
consequence
of
the
“shifting
automorphisms”
discussed
in
[EtTh],
Proposition
2.14,
(ii)
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[EtTh],
Remark
2.14.3].
That
is
to
say,
despite
the
fact
that
the
meromorphic
function
constituted
by
the
theta
function
does
not
admit
such
symmetries,
the
corresponding
mono-theta
environment
does
admit
such
symmetries.
This
is
one
important
diﬀerence
between
the
theory
of
mono-theta
environments
and
the
theory
of
bi-theta
environments
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[EtTh],
Remark
2.14.3].
Alternatively,
the
existence
of
such
symmetries
may
be
regarded
as
one
of
the
fundamental
diﬀerences
between
the
mono-theta-theoretic
approach
to
cyclotomic
rigidity
taken
in
[EtTh]
and
the
approach
to
cyclotomic
rigidity
taken
in
[IUTchI],
Example
5.1,
(v),
via
Kummer
classes
of
rational
functions.
Put
another
way,
this
fundamental
diﬀerence
may
be
thought
of
as
the
diﬀerence
between
constructing
a
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphism
from
a
line
bundle
—
INTER-UNIVERSAL
TEICHMÜLLER
THEORY
II
25
i.e.,
which,
in
general,
admits
more
symmetries
than
a
rational
function
—
and
constructing
a
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphism
from
a
rational
function.
On
the
other
hand,
if
one
attempts
to
mimick
the
approach
of
[EtTh]
[i.e.,
of
constructing
“shifting
automorphisms”
as
in
[EtTh],
Proposition
2.14,
(ii)]
in
the
case
of
symmetries
with
respect
to
the
quotient
ΔC
(MΘ
)

ΔC
(MΘ
)/ΔX
(MΘ
)
∼
=
F±
l
,
then
it
is
necessary
to
allow
“denominators
of
the
form
1l
”
when
one
works
with
the
module
ΠMΘ
|(l·ΔΘ
)(MΘ
)
.
In
fact,
however,
when
one
computes
the
commutator
map
[−,
−]
considered
in
(iv),
such
terms
with
denominators
vanish,
as
a
consequence
of
the
fact
that
ΠMΘ
|(l·ΔΘ
)(MΘ
)
commutes
with
the
elements
of
interest
in
the
computation
of
this
commutator
map.
It
is
precisely
this
state
of
aﬀairs
that
allows
one
to
construct
an
F±
l
-symmetric
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphism
as
discussed
in
(iv),
that
is
to
say,
which,
by
itself,
is
somewhat
weaker
than
the
“full
mono-theta
environment”
[i.e.,
which
does
not
admit
F±
l
-symmetries
unless
one
allows
for
denominators
as
discussed
above!].
Thus,
in
summary,
by
comparison
to
the
approach
to
cyclotomic
rigidity
taken
in
[EtTh],
the
slightly
weaker
approach
discussed
in
(iv)
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
the
diﬀerence
between
constructing
a
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphism
from
a
line
bundle
and
constructing
a
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphism
from
the
curvature,
or
ﬁrst
Chern
class,
of
the
line
bundle
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
3.6.5
below].
One
key
property
of
mono-theta
environments
is
that
they
may
be
constructed
either
group-theoretically
from
Πtp
X

category-theoretically
from
certain
tempered
Frobenioids
related
to
X

We

is
the
resulting
compatibility
of

systems

[as
in

with
the
discrete
structure
inherent
in

that
appear
in

[cf.

Remark
1.5.2.
Note
that,
in
the
notation
of
Proposition
1.5,
(iii),
by
considering
“tautological
Kummer
classes”

J
whose
image
is
equal
to
the
torsion
subgroup
of
the
codomain
of
the
injection.
Indeed,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
fact
that
Πμ
(MΘ

)
is
torsion-free
that
the
torsion
subgroup
of
the
codomain
of
the
displayed

may
be
identiﬁed
with
the

where

of

);
we
write
JG
for
the

in

The
desired
conclusion
thus
follows
immediately
from
INTER-UNIVERSAL

31
the
well-known
Kummer

the

is

Before

The

from

of


Remark
1.6.1.
We
recall
in
passing
that
the
construction
of
Proposition
1.6,
(i),
amounts,
in
eﬀect,
to
the
computation
of
various
centralizers
of
the
image
of
various
open
subgroups
of
Π/Δ
in
the
outer

groups
of
various
open

of

In
a
similar
vein,
the
construction
of
Proposition
1.6,
(ii),
amounts
to
the
computation
of
various
outer
isomorphisms
between
various
subquotients
of
32

that
are
compatible
with
the
outer
actions
of
various
open
subgroups
of
Π/Δ.
More
generally,
although
in
Proposition
1.6,
we
restricted
our
attention
to
the
construction
of
cores
and
elliptic
cuspidalizations,
an
analogous
result
may
be
obtained
for
more
general
functorial
group-theoretic
algorithms
involving
“chains
of
elementary
operations”,
as
discussed
in
[AbsTopI],
§4
—
e.g.,
for
Belyi
cuspidalizations,
as
discussed
in
[AbsTopII],
Corollary
3.7.
Next,
we
proceed
to
discuss
the
“multiradial”
interpretation
of
the
theory
of
[EtTh]
that
is
of
interest
in
the
context
of
the
present
series
of
papers.
We
begin
by
examining
various
examples
of
the
sort
of
situation
that
gives
rise
to
such
an
interpretation.
Example
1.7.
Radial
and
Coric
Data
I:
Generalities.
(i)
In
the
following
discussion,
we
would
like
to
consider
a
certain
“type
of
mathematical
data”,
which
we
shall
refer
to
as
radial
data.
This
notion
of
a
“type
of
mathematical
data”
may
be
formalized
—
cf.
[IUTchIV],
§3,
for
more
details.
From
the
point
of
view
of
the
present
discussion,
one
may
think
of
a
“type
of
mathematical
data”
as
the
input
or
output
data
of
a
“functorial
algorithm”
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],
Remark
3.2.1].
At
a
more
concrete
level,
we
shall
assume
that
this
“type
of
mathematical
data”
gives
rise
to
a
category
R
—
i.e.,
each
of
whose
objects
is
a
speciﬁc
collection
of
radial
data,
and
each
of
whose
morphisms
is
an
isomorphism.
In
the
following
discussion,
we
shall
also
consider
another
“type
of
mathematical
data”,
which
we
shall
refer
to
as
coric
data.
Write
C
for
the
category
obtained
by
considering
speciﬁc
collections
of
coric
data
and
isomorphisms
of
collections
of
coric
data.
In
addition,
we
shall
assume
that
we
are
given
a
functorial
algorithm
—
which
we
shall
refer
to
as
radial
—
whose
input
data
consists
of
a
collection
of
radial
data,
and
whose
output
data
consists
of
a
collection
of
coric
data.
Thus,
this
functorial
algorithm
gives
rise
to
a
functor
Φ
:
R
→
C.
In
the
following
discussion,
we
shall
assume
that
this
functor
is
essentially
surjective.
We
shall
refer
to
the
category
R
and
the
functor
Φ
as
radial
and
to
the
category
C
as
coric.
Finally,
if
I
is
some
nonempty
index
set,
then
we
shall
often
consider
collections
{Φi
:
Ri
→
C}i∈I
of
copies
of
Φ
and
R,
such
that
the
various
copies
of
Φ
have
the
same
codomain
C
—
cf.
Fig.
1.1
below.
Thus,
one
may
think
of
each
Ri
as
the
category
of
radial
data
equipped
with
a
label
i
∈
I,
and
isomorphisms
of
such
data.
(ii)
We
shall
refer
to
a
triple
(R,
C,
Φ
:
R
→
C)
[or
to
the
triple
consisting
of
the
corresponding
“types
of
mathematical
objects”
and
“functorial
algorithm”]
of
the
sort
discussed
in
(i)
as
a
radial
environment.
If
Φ
is
full,
then
we
shall
refer
to
the
radial
environment
under
consideration
as
multiradial.
We
shall
refer
to
a
radial
environment
which
is
not
multiradial
as
uniradial.
Suppose
that
the
radial
environment
(R,
C,
Φ
:
R
→
C)
under
consideration
is
uniradial.
Then
an
object
of
R
may,
in
general,
lose
a
certain
portion
of
its
rigidity
—
i.e.,
may
be
subject
to
a
INTER-UNIVERSAL
TEICHMÜLLER
THEORY
II
33
certain
additional
indeterminacy
—
when
it
is
mapped
to
C.
Put
another
way,
in
general,
an
object
of
C
is
imparted
with
a
certain
additional
rigidity
—
i.e.,
loses
a
certain
portion
of
its
indeterminacy
—
when
one
ﬁxes
a
lifting
of
the
object
to
R.
Thus,
in
summary,
the
condition
that
(R,
C,
Φ
:
R
→
C)
be
multiradial
may
be
thought
of
as
a
condition
to
the
eﬀect
that
the
application
of
the
radial
algorithm
does
not
result
in
any
loss
of
rigidity.
Finally,
we
observe
that,
if
(R,
C,
Φ
:
R
→
C)
is
an
arbitrary
radial
environment
such
that
any
two
collections
of
radial
data
are
isomorphic,
then
one
may
deﬁne
the
associated
[tautological]
multiradialization
(Rmtz
,
C,
Φmtz
:
Rmtz
→
C)
of
this
radial
environment
as
follows:
A
collection
of
radial
data
(R,
C,
α)
of
this
multiradialization
consists
of
an
object
R
of
R,
an
object
C
of
C,
and
the
full
∼
poly-isomorphism
[cf.
[IUTchI],
§0]
α
:
Φ(R)
→
C.
An
isomorphism
of
collections
∼
of
radial
data
(R,
C,
α)
→
(R∗
,
C
∗
,
α∗
)
of
the
multiradialization
consists
of
a
pair
of
∼
∼
isomorphisms
R
→
R∗
,
C
→
C
∗
[which
are
necessarily
compatible
with
α,
α∗
].
The
coric
data
of
the
multiradialization
is
taken
to
be
the
coric
data
of
the
original
radial
environment
(R,
C,
Φ
:
R
→
C).
The
radial
algorithm
of
the
multiradialization
is
taken
to
be
the
assignment
(R,
C,
α)
→
C
—
whose
associated
radial
functor
is
clearly
full
[cf.
our
assumption
that
any
two
collections
of
radial
data
are
isomorphic!]
and
essentially
surjective,
hence
determines
a
[tautologically!]
multiradial
environment
(Rmtz
,
C,
Φmtz
:
Rmtz
→
C),
together
with
a
natural
functor
R
→
Rmtz
[i.e.,
given
by
the
assignment
R
→
∼
(R,
Φ(R),
Φ(R)
→
Φ(R))].
Indeed,
the
tautological
multiradialization
of
the
given
radial
environment
may
be
thought
of
as
the
result
of
“forgetting,
in
a
minimal
possible
fashion,
the
uniradiality”
of
the
original
radial
environment
(R,
C,
Φ
:
R
→
C).

(iii)
In
passing,
we
pause
to
observe
that
one
way
to
think
of
the
signiﬁcance
of
the
multiradiality
of
a
radial
environment
(R,
C,
Φ
:
R
→
C)
is
as
follows:
Write
R
×C
R
for
the
category
whose
objects
are
triples
(R1
,
R2
,
α)
consisting
of
a
pair
of
objects
∼
R1
,
R2
of
R
and
an
isomorphism
α
:
Φ(R1
)
→
Φ(R2
)
between
the
images
of
R1
,
R2
via
Φ,
and
whose
morphisms
are
the
morphisms
[in
the
evident
sense]
between
such
triples
[cf.
the
discussion
of
the
“categorical
ﬁber
product”
given
in
[FrdI],
§0].
∼
Write
sw
:
R
×C
R
→
R
×C
R
for
the
functor
(R1
,
R2
,
α)
→
(R2
,
R1
,
α−1
)
obtained
by
switching
the
two
factors
of
R.
Then
one
formal
consequence
of
the
multiradiality
of
a
radial
environment
(R,
C,
Φ
:
R
→
C)
is
the
property
that
the
switching
functor
sw
:
∼
R×C
R
→
R×C
R
preserves
the
isomorphism
class
of
objects
of
R×C
R.
Indeed,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
this
multiradiality
is,
in
fact,
equivalent
to
the
condition
that
every
object
(R1
,
R2
,
α)
of
R
×C
R
be
isomorphic
to
the
object
∼
(R1
,
R1
,
id
:
Φ(R1
)
→
Φ(R1
))
[which
is
manifestly
left
unchanged
by
the
switching
functor].
(iv)
Next,
suppose
that
we
are
given
another
radial
environment
(R†
,
C
†
,
Φ†
:
R†
→
C
†
).
We
shall
refer
to
the
“type
of
mathematical
object”/“functorial
algorithm”
that
gives
rise
to
R†
(respectively,
C
†
;
Φ†
)
as
daggered
radial
data
(respectively,
daggered
coric
data;
the
daggered
radial
functorial
algorithm).
Also,
let
us
suppose
that
we
are
given
a
1-commutative
diagram

R
R
−→
R†
⏐
⏐
⏐
⏐
†
Φ
Φ
C
Ψ
C
−→
C†
—
where
ΨR
and
ΨC
arise
from
“functorial
algorithms”.
If
(R,
C,
Φ
:
R
→
C)
is
multiradial
(respectively,
uniradial),
then
we
shall
refer
to
ΨR
as
multiradially
deﬁned
(respectively,
uniradially
deﬁned),
or
[when
there
is
no
fear
of
confusion
between
Φ
and
ΨR
]
as
multiradial
(respectively,
uniradial).
If
ΨR
admits
a
1factorization
ΞR
◦
Φ
for
some
ΞR
:
C
→
R†
that
arises
from
a
functorial
algorithm,
then
we
shall
say
that
ΨR
is
corically
deﬁned,
or
[when
there
is
no
fear
of
confusion]
coric.
Thus,
by
considering
the
case
where
R
=
C,
Φ
=
idR
,
one
may
think
of
the
notion
of
a
corically
deﬁned
ΨR
as
a
sort
of
special
case
of
the
notion
of
a
multiradial
ΨR
.
(v)
Suppose
that
we
are
in
the
situation
of
(iv),
and
that
ΨR
is
multiradially
deﬁned.
Then
one
way
to
think
of
the
signiﬁcance
of
the
multiradiality
of
ΨR
is
as
follows:
The
multiradiality
of
ΨR
renders
it
possible
to
consider
the
simultaneous
execution
of
the
functorial
algorithm
corresponding
to
ΨR
relative
to
various
collections
of
radial
input
data
indexed
by
the
set
I
[cf.
Fig.
1.1]
in
a
fashion
that
is
compatible
with
the
identiﬁcation
of
the
coric
portions
[i.e.,
corresponding
to
Φ]
of
these
collections
of
radial
input
data
INTER-UNIVERSAL

35
—
cf.
Remark
1.9.1
below
for
more
on
this
point
of
view.
That
is
to
say,
at
a
more
technical
level,
if
one
implements
this
identiﬁcation
of
the
various
coric
portions
by
means
of
various
gluing
isomorphisms
in
C,
then
the
multiradiality
of
ΨR
implies
that
one
may
lift
these
gluing
isomorphisms
in
C
to
gluing
isomorphisms
in
R;
one
may
then
apply
ΨR
to
these
gluing
isomorphisms
in
R
to
obtain
gluing
isomorphisms
of
the
output
data
of
ΨR
.
Put
another
way,
if
one
assumes
instead
that
ΨR
is
uniradial,
then
the
output
data
of
ΨR
depends,
a
priori,
on
the
“additional
rigidity”
[cf.
(ii)]
of
objects
of
R
relative
to
these
images
in
C;
thus,
if
one
attempts
to
identify
these
images
in
C
via
arbitrary
gluing
isomorphisms
in
C,
then
one
does
not
have
any
way
to
compute
the
eﬀect
of
such
gluing
isomorphisms
on
the
output
data
of
ΨR
.
Remark
1.7.1.
One
way
to
understand
the
signiﬁcance
of
the
fullness
condition
in
the
deﬁnition
of
a
multiradial
environment
is
as
a
condition
that
allows
one
to
execute
a
sort
of
parallel
transport
operation
between
“ﬁbers”
of
the
radial
functor
Φ
:
R
→
C
[cf.
the
notation
of
Example
1.7,
(iv)]
—
i.e.,
by
lifting
isomorphisms
in
C
to
isomorphisms
in
R
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Example
1.7,
(v)].
Here,
it
is
perhaps
of
interest
to
make
the
tautological
observation
that,
up
to
an
indeterminacy
arising
from
the
extent
that
Φ
fails
to
be
faithful,
such
liftings
are
unique.
That
is
to
say,
whereas
a
uniradial
environment
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
abstraction
of
the
geometric
notion
of
a
“ﬁbration
that
is
not
equipped
with
a
connection”,
a
multiradial
environment
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
abstraction
of
the
geometric
notion
of
a
“ﬁbration
equipped
with
a
connection”
—
i.e.,
that
allows
one
to
execute
parallel
transport
operations
between
the
“ﬁbers”.
Relative
to
this
point
of
view,
one
may
think
of
the
coric
data
as
the
portion
of
the
radial
data
of
a
multiradial
environment
that
is
horizontal
with
respect
to
the
“connection
structure”.
We
refer
to
Remarks
1.9.1,
1.9.2

for
more
on
the
signiﬁcance
of
multiradiality.

of
which
may,
in

be
understood
as
special
cases
of
the
notion

the

—
i.e.,
a
“co-cyclotomic

of

[cf.

Now
one
veriﬁes
easily
that
INTER-UNIVERSAL

by
replacing
the
symbol
“×”
in
(iii)
by
the
symbol
“μ”
or,
alternatively,
by
the
symbol
“×μ”,
one
obtains,
respectively,
“cyclotomic”
and
“co-cyclotomic”
versions
of
the
example
treated
in
(iii).
In
the
case
of
“×μ”,
let
us
write
Ism(G)
for
the
compact
topological
group
of
G-isometries
of
O×μ
(G),
i.e.,
G-equivariant
automorphisms
of
the
ind-topological
module
O×μ
(G)
that,
for
each
open
subgroup
H
⊆
G,
preserve
the
“lattice”
in
O×μ
(G)H
determined
by
the
image
of
O×
(G)H
[i.e.,
where
the
superscript
“H”
denotes
the
submodule
of
H-invariants].
Let
Γ×μ
⊆
Ism(−)
be
a
closed
subgroup,
i.e.,
a
collection
of
closed
subgroups
of
each
Ism(G)
that
is
∼
preserved
by
arbitrary
isomorphisms
of
topological

.
Then
one
veriﬁes
easily
that,
in
the
“co-cyclotomic”
version
discussed
above
of
the
example
treated
in
(iii),
one
may
replace
the
“Γ”
in
(iii)
by
such
a
“Γ×μ

Finally,
we
observe
that
one
example
of
such
a
“Γ×μ

—
which
we
shall
denote
by
means
of
the
notation

—
is
the
case
where
one
takes
Γ×μ
to
be
the

“Ism(−)”;
another

such

is
the

Data
III:
Graphs
of
Functorial
Grouptheoretic
Algorithms.
(i)
Let
E
and
F
be
categories
that
arise
from
“types
of
mathematical
data”
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Example
1.7,
(i)];
Ξ
:
E
→
F
a
functor
that
arises
from
a
“functorial
algorithm”
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Example
1.7,
(i)].
Then
one
may
deﬁne
a
new
category
G
—
that
also
arises
from
a
“type
of
mathematical
data”
—
as
follows:
the
objects
of
G
are
pairs
(E,
Ξ(E)),
where
E
∈
Ob(E),
and
Ξ(E)
∈
Ob(F)
is
the
image
of
E
via
Ξ;
the
morphisms
of
G
are
the
pairs
of
arrows
(f
:
E
→
E
,
Ξ(f
)
:
Ξ(E)
→
Ξ(E
)).
We
shall
refer
to
G
[or
the
“type
of
mathematical
data”
that
gives
rise
to
G]
as
the
graph
of
Ξ.
Note
that
this
construction
was
applied,
in
eﬀect,
in
the
discussion
of
the
various
radial
environments
constructed
in
Example
1.8.
Finally,
we
observe
that
we
have
natural
functors
E
→
G
[given
by
E
→
(E,
Ξ(E))],
G
→
E
[given
by
(E,
Ξ(E))
→
E],
G
→
F
[given
by
(E,
Ξ(E))
→
Ξ(E)].
(ii)
In
the
notation
of
(i),
suppose
that
E
is
the
category
of
topological
groups
isomorphic
to
Πtp
X
and
isomorphisms
of
topological
groups,
and
that
Ξ
is
some
k
“functorial
group-theoretic
algorithm”
[whose
input
data
consists
of
a
topological
group
isomorphic
to
Πtp
X
].
Let
(R,
C,
Φ)
be
the
radial
environment
of
Example
1.8,
k
(i).
Then
composing
the
functor
R
→
E
given
by
the
assignment
(Π,
G,
α)
→
Π
with
Ξ
:
E
→
F
yields
a
functor
R
→
F,
whose
graph
we
denote
by
R†
.
Thus,
by
considering
the
natural
functors
ΨR
:
R
→
R†
[cf.
(i)],
R†
→
R
→
C,
and
taking
def
C
†
=
C,
we
obtain
a
diagram
as
in
the
display
of
Example
1.7,
(iv).
Since
(R,
C,
Φ)
is
a
multiradial
environment,
it
thus
follows
that
ΨR
is
multiradially
deﬁned
[cf.
Example
1.7,
(iv)].
That
is
to
say,
by
using
the
radial
environment
of
Example
1.8,
(i),
one
concludes
that
any
“functorial
group-theoretic
algorithm”
whose
input
data
consists
of
a
topological
group
isomorphic
to
Πtp
X
gives
rise
—
in
a
tautological
fashion
k
[cf.
the
discussion
of
tautological
multiradializations
in
Example
1.7,
(ii)]
—
to
a
multiradially
deﬁned
functor.
This
approach
will
be
discussed
further
in
Remark
1.9.1
below.
(iii)
On
the
other
hand,
one
may
also
construct
a
radial
environment
as
follows.
We
deﬁne
a
collection
of
radial
data
to
be
a
topological
group
Π
isomorphic
to
Πtp
X
,
k
and
an
isomorphism
of
collections
of
radial
data
to
be
an
isomorphism
of
topological
groups.
The
deﬁnitions
of
coric
data
and
isomorphisms
of
collections
of
coric
data
are
the
same
as
in
Example
1.8,
(i).
The
radial
functor
Φ
:
R
→
C
is
deﬁned
via
the
assignment
Π
→
Π/Δ
[cf.
the
notation
of
Example
1.8,
(i)].
Thus,
Φ
fails
to
be
full
INTER-UNIVERSAL
TEICHMÜLLER
THEORY
II
43
[cf.,
e.g.,
[AbsTopIII],
§I3;
[AbsTopIII],
Remark
1.9.1].
That
is
to
say,
(R,
C,
Φ)
is
a
uniradial
environment.
Now
suppose
that
Ξ
:
E
→
F
is
as
in
(ii).
Then
since
R
may
be
identiﬁed
with
E,
the
graph
of
Ξ
:
R
=
E
→
F
yields
a
category
R†
equipped
def
with
natural
functors
ΨR
:
R
→
R†
,
Φ†
:
R†
→
R
→
C
†
=
C.
In
particular,
we
obtain
a
diagram
as
in
the
display
of
Example
1.7,
(iv).
Since
(R,
C,
Φ)
is
a
uniradial
environment,
it
thus
follows
that
ΨR
is
uniradially
deﬁned
[cf.
Example
1.7,
(iv)].
That
is
to
say,
by
using
the
radial
environment
just
deﬁned,
one
concludes
that
any
“functorial
group-theoretic
algorithm”
whose
input
data
consists
of
a
topological
group
isomorphic
to
Πtp
X
also
gives
rise
—
in
a
tautological
k
fashion
—
to
a
uniradially
deﬁned
functor.
This
approach
will
be
discussed
further
in
Remark
1.9.1
below.
(iv)
Let
Π
be
a
topological
group
isomorphic
to
Πtp
X
;
Δ
⊆
Π
the
subgroup
∼
k
of
Example
1.8,
(i).
Recall
the
isomorphism
“μZ
(Gk
)
→
μZ
(ΠX
)”
of
[AbsTopIII],
Corollary
1.10,
(c),
which
is
constructed
by
means
of
a
“functorial
group-theoretic
algorithm”.
The
inverse
of
this
isomorphism
yields
a
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphism
∼
(l
·
ΔΘ
)(Π)
→
μZ
(Π/Δ)
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Proposition
1.3,
(ii)]
—
where
we
write
“(l
·
ΔΘ
)(Π)”
for
the
[group-theoretic!]
subquotient
of
Π
discussed
in
[EtTh],
Corollary
2.18,
(i).
Thus,
in
summary,
one
has
a
“functorial
group-theoretic
algorithm”
whose
input
data
consists
of
the
topological
group
Π,
and
whose
output
data
may
be
thought
of
as
consisting
of
Π,
the
two
topological
Π-modules
“(l
·
ΔΘ
)(Π)”,
“μZ
(Π/Δ)”,
and
∼
the
above
isomorphism
of
Π-modules
(l
·
ΔΘ
)(Π)
→
μZ
(Π/Δ).
Thus,
if
one
takes
this
“functorial
group-theoretic
algorithm”
to
be
the
algorithm
that
gives
rise
to
the
functor
Ξ
in
the
discussion
of
(ii)
and
(iii),
then
one
concludes
that
the
above
∼
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphism
(l
·
ΔΘ
)(Π)
→
μZ
(Π/Δ)
may
be
thought
of
as
giving
rise
to
either
(a)
a
multiradially
deﬁned
functor,
via
the
approach
of
(ii),
or
(b)
a
uniradially
deﬁned
functor,
via
the
approach
of
(iii).
On
the
other
hand,
there
is
also
another
way
to
obtain
a
multiradially
deﬁned
functor
from
this
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphism,
as
follows.
Let
(R,
C,
Φ)
be
the
multiradial
environment
of
Example
1.8,
(i).
Now
deﬁne
a
collection
of
daggered
radial
data
∼
(Π,
G,
α,
(l
·
ΔΘ
)(Π)
→
μZ
(G))
to
consist
of
radial
data
(Π,
G,
α)
as
in
Example
1.8,
(i),
together
with
the
poly∼
isomorphism
(l
·
ΔΘ
)(Π)
→
μZ
(G)
obtained
by
composing
the
above
cyclotomic
∼
rigidity
isomorphism
“(l·ΔΘ
)(Π)
→
μZ
(Π/Δ)”
with
the
poly-isomorphism
μZ
(Π/Δ)
∼
∼
→
μZ
(G)
induced
by
the
poly-isomorphism
α
:
Π/Δ
→
G.
Thus,
the
poly∼
isomorphism
(l
·
ΔΘ
)(Π)
→
μZ
(G)
consists
not
of
a
single
isomorphism
of
topological
modules,
but
rather
of
an
Aut(G)-orbit
—
or,
more
precisely,
a
Γ-orbit,
where
Γ
⊆
Z×
is
the
image
of
Aut(G)
via
the
cyclotomic
character
on
Aut(G)
[cf.
[AbsAnab],
Proposition
1.2.1,
(vi)]
—
of
isomorphisms
of
topological
modules.
An
44
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
isomorphism
of
collections
of
daggered
radial
data
is
deﬁned
to
be
an
isomorphism
between
the
underlying
collections
of
radial
data
[which
is
necessarily
compatible
with
the
poly-isomorphism
of
topological
modules
that
constitutes
the
ﬁnal
member
def
of
the
collections
of
daggered
radial
data
in
question].
Thus,
if
we
take
C
†
=
C,
then
the
“functorial
group-theoretic
algorithm”
that
gives
rise
to
the
cyclotomic
rigid∼
ity
isomorphism
“(l
·
ΔΘ
)(Π)
→
μZ
(Π/Δ)”
yields
a
functor
ΨR
:
R
→
R†
[that
arises
from
a
“functorial
algorithm”],
together
with
a
diagram
as
in
the
display
of
Example
1.7,
(iv).
That
is
to
say,
(c)
this
multiradially
deﬁned
functor
ΨR
:
R
→
R†
yields
an
alternative
[i.e.,
relative
to
(a)]
multiradial
approach
to
representing
the
“functorial
grouptheoretic
algorithm”
that
gives
rise
to
the
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphism
∼
“(l
·
ΔΘ
)(Π)
→
μZ
(Π/Δ)”.
This
is
the
approach
taken
in
Corollary
1.11,
(b),
below.
Remark
1.9.1.
In
general,
the
portion
of
the
“functorial
group-theoretic
algorithm”
that
appears
in
the
discussion
of
Example
1.9,
(ii),
(iii),
and
(iv),
which
involves
the
quotient
Π/Δ
of
Π
will
depend
not
only
on
the
structure
of
the
abstract
topological
group
underlying
Π/Δ,
but
also
on
the
structure
of
Π/Δ
as
a
quotient
of
Π
—
i.e.,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
discussion
of
Example
1.8,
(i),
on
the
“arithmetic
holomorphic
structure”
on
the
topological
group
Π/Δ
determined
by
this
quotient
structure.
In
fact,
the
original
motivation
for
the
introduction
of
the
“multiradial
terminology”
of
Example
1.7
was
precisely
to
study
the
extent
to
which
such
“functorial
group-theoretic
algorithms”
could
be
formulated
in
such
a
way
as
to
compute
which
portions
of
the
output
data
of
such
algorithms
do
indeed
depend
in
an
essential
way
on
the
“arithmetic
holomorphic
structure”
and
which
portions
are
“mono-analytic”
[cf.
[AbsTopIII],
§I3],
i.e.,
depend
only
on
the
structure
of
the
topological
group
Π/Δ
[which
one
thinks
of
as
a
sort
of
“underlying
arithmetic
real
analytic
structure”
of
the
“arithmetic
holomorphic
structures”
involved].
From
this
point
of
view,
the
tautological
approach
of
Example
1.9,
(ii)
[i.e.,
Example
1.9,
(iv),
(a)],
may
be
thought
of
as
expressing
the
idea
that
if
one
thinks
of
each
of
the
quotients
“Π/Δ”
in
the
“spokes”
of
Fig.
1.2
as
being
equipped
with
a
ﬁxed
“arithmetic
holomorphic
structure”
and
hence
only
related
to
the
coric
“G”
via
some
indeterminate
isomorphism
of
topological
groups,
then
one
obtains
a
multiradially
deﬁned
functor,
i.e.,
a
functor
that
is
tautologically
compatible
with
mono-analytic
deformations
of
the
various
“arithmetic
holomorphic
structures”
that
one
might
impose
on
the
coric
“G”.
Put
another
way,
this
multiradially
deﬁned
algorithm
is
an
algorithm
that
is
tautologically
compatible
with
simultaneous
execution
on
multiple
spokes
of
Fig.
1.2.
By
contrast,
the
tautological
approach
of
Example
1.9,
(iii)
[i.e.,
Example
1.9,
(iv),
(b)],
may
be
thought
of
as
expressing
the
idea
that
if
one
tries
to
identify
the
various
quotients
“Π/Δ”
in
the
“spokes”
of
Fig.
1.2
via
arbitrary
mono-analytic
isomorphisms,
then
one
only
obtains
a
uniradially
deﬁned
functor,
i.e.,
a
functor
that
fails
to
be
compatible
with
mono-analytic
identiﬁcations
[i.e.,
gluing
isomorphisms]
of
the
various
“arithmetic
holomorphic
structures”
on
the
coric
“G”.
Put
another
way,
this
uniradially
deﬁned
algorithm
is
an
algorithm

that
can
only
be
consistently
executed
on
one
spoke
at
a
time.
Finally,
the
approach
of
Example
1.9,
(iv),
(c),
expresses
the
idea
that,
in
the
case
of
the
particular
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphism
under
consideration,
if
one
weakens
the
rigidity
of
this
isomorphism
by
working
with
this
isomorphism
up
to
a
certain
indeterminacy,
then
one
may
construct
a
multiradially
deﬁned
functor,
i.e.,
a
functor
that
is
indeed
compatible
with
mono-analytic
identiﬁcations
[i.e.,
gluing
isomorphisms]
of
the
various
“arithmetic
holomorphic
structures”
on
the
coric
“G”,
albeit
up
to
a
certain
speciﬁed
indeterminacy.
Thus,
the
multiradiality
obtained
in
Example
1.9,
(iv),
(c),
depends,
in
an
essential
way,
on
the
content
of
the
“functorial
group-theoretic
algorithm”
involved.
This
approach
taken
in
Example
1.9,
(iv),
(c),
is
representative
of
the
approach
taken
in
Corollaries
1.10,
1.11,
and
1.12
below,
which
may
be
thought
of
as
“computations”
of
the
“certain
indeterminacy”
that
one
must
allow
in
order
to
construct
a
multiradially
deﬁned
functor
as
in
Example
1.9,
(iv),
(c).
Remark
1.9.2.
(i)
One
way
to
summarize
the
discussion
of
Remark
1.9.1
is
as
follows.
If
uniradially
deﬁned
functors
correspond
to
constructions
that
depend,
in
a
strict
sense,
on
the
“arithmetic
holomorphic
structure”,
while
corically
deﬁned
functors
correspond
to
constructions
that
only
depend
on
the
underlying
mono-analytic
structure
[i.e.,
“arithmetic
real
analytic
structure”],
then
multiradially
deﬁned
functors
correspond
to
constructions
that
depend
on
the
“arithmetic
holomorphic
structure”,
but
only
in
a
fashion
that
is
compatible
with
a
given
description
of
how
this
arithmetic
holomorphic
structure
is
related
to
—
e.g.,
“embedded
in”
—
the
underlying
monoanalytic
structure.
For
instance,
in
the
various
multiradial
environments
of
Example
1.8,
this
description
of
the
relation
to
the
underlying
mono-analytic
structure
is
given,
at
a
concrete
level,
by
the
various
poly-morphisms
[or
diagrams
of
poly-morphisms]
“α(−)
”
that
appear
in
the
radial
data
of
these
multiradial
environments.
This
point
of
view
is
summarized
in
Fig.
1.3
below.
(ii)
From
the
point
of
view
of
the
analogy
with
connections
discussed
in
Remark
1.7.1,
one
may
think
of
a
multiradial
environment
as
a
structure
that
allows
one
to
execute
parallel
transport
operations
between
distinct
arithmetic
holomorphic
stuctures,
i.e.,
to
describe
what
one
arithmetic
holomorphic
structure
looks
like
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
distinct
arithmetic
holomorphic
structure
that
is
only
related
to
the
original
arithmetic
holomorphic
structure
via
the
mono-analytic
core.
(iii)
From
the
point
of
view
of
the
analogy
with
connections
discussed
in
Remark
1.7.1,
it
is
also
interesting
to
observe
that
one
may
think
of
the
diﬀerent
approaches
to
multiradiality
discussed
in
Example
1.9,
(iv),
(a),
(c),
as
being
roughly
analogous
to
the
phenomenon
of
distinct
connection
structures
on
a
single
ﬁbration.
Moreover,
of
these
diﬀerent
approaches,
the
tautological,
“general
nonsense”
approach
of
Example
1.9,
(iv),
(a),
is,
in
some
sense,
[not
surprisingly!]
the
“least
interesting”
[although
it
will
at
times
be
of
use
in
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers!].
This
sort
of
“general
nonsense”
approach
is
reminiscent
of
the
46
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
tautological
approach
to
constructing
connections
that
occurs
in
the
p-adic
theory
of
the
crystalline
site,
i.e.,
by
simply
forming
the
tensor
product
with
the
ring
of
functions
of
the
PD-envelope
along
the
diagonal
of
the
ﬁber
product
of
two
copies
of
the
space
under
consideration.
From
the
point
of
view
of
the
issue
of
“describing
what
one
arithmetic
holomorphic
structure
looks
like
from
the
point
of
view
of
another”
[cf.
(ii)],
the
“tautological”
approach
is
not
very
interesting
precisely
because
it
involves
working,
in
eﬀect,
with
the
“tautological”
collection
of
“labels
of
all
possible
arithmetic
holomorphic
structures”
—
i.e.,
corresponding
to
the
various
choices
of
one
particular
arrow
among
the
arrows
that
constitute
the
poly-morphism
denoted
“α”
in
Example
1.8,
(i)
—
without
describing
in
further,
more
explicit
terms
what
these
various
“alien”
arithmetic
holomorphic
structures
look
like
relative
to
structures
determined
by
a
given
arithmetic
holomorphic
structure.
By
contrast,
the
“non-tautological”
approach
to
multiradiality
of
Example
1.9,
(iv),
(c),
by
means
of
the
explicit
computation
of
indeterminacies
is
much
more
interesting
in
that
it
yields
a
more
detailed,
explicit
description
of
a
structure
[e.g.,
a
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphism]
associated
to
an

Remark
1.10.3.
In
the
context
of
Corollary
1.10,
it
is
useful
to
recall
the
following
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[EtTh],
Remark
1.10.4,
(ii)].
Although
at
ﬁrst
glance,
it
might
appear
as
though
it
might
be
possible
to
develop
a
similar
theory
to
the
theory
developed
in
the
present
series
of
papers
based
on
a
more
general
sort
of
meromorphic
function
than
the
theta
function,
it
is
by
no
means
clear
that
such
a
more
general
meromorphic
function
satisﬁes
the
crucial
cyclotomic
rigidity,
discrete
rigidity,
and
constant
multiple
rigidity
properties
studied
in
[EtTh].
Of
these
properties,
the
cyclotomic
rigidity
property,
which
forms
the
basis
of
Corollary
1.10,
depends
most
explicitly
[cf.
[EtTh],
Remark
2.19.2]
on
ell
the
structure
of
the
theta
quotient

Remark
3.1.2,
(iii)
[cf.
also
the
discussion
of
Remark
1.1.1
of
the
present
paper],
i.e.,
which
corresponds
to
the
“theta
group”
in
more
classical
treatments
of
the
theta
function.
Since
the
theta
function
is,
roughly
speaking,
essentially
characterized
among
meromorphic
functions
by
the
property
that
it
satisﬁes
the
“theta
symmetries”
arising
from
the
theta
group,
it
is
thus
diﬃcult
to
see
how
to
generalize
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers
so
as
to
treat
more
general
meromorphic
functions
than
the
theta
function
[cf.
Remark
1.1.1,
(v);
[IUTchIII],
Remark
2.3.3,
for
a
more
detailed
discussion
of
related
issues].
Also,
in
this
context,
it
is
useful
to
recall
that
unlike
the
theta
function
itself,
which
is
strictly
local

the
underlying
ind-topological
module
equipped
with
a
topological
group
action
—
i.e.,
in
the
terminology
of
[AbsTopIII],
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(ii),
MLF-Galois
TCG-pair
—
of
G

O×
(G)
maps
surjectively
[i.e.,
by
forgetting
“O×
(G)”]
onto
the
group
of
automorphisms
of
the
topological
group
G,
with
kernel
given
by
the
[G-linear]
automorphisms
of
[the
underlying
ind-topological
module
of]
O×
(G)
determined
by
the
natural
action
of
Z×
[cf.
[AbsTopIII],
Proposition
3.3,
(ii)].
Also,
we
observe
that
by
the
same
proof
involving
the
Kummer
map
as
that
given
for
(b)
in
[AbsTopIII],
Proposition
3.3,
(ii),
it
follows
that
(c)
the
group
of
automorphisms
of
the
underlying
ind-topological
module
equipped
with
a
topological
group
action
of
G

Ogp
(G)
maps
surjectively
[i.e.,
by
forgetting
“Ogp
(G)”]
onto
the
group
of
automorphisms
of
the
topological
group
G,
with
kernel
given
by
the
[G-linear]
automorphisms
of
[the
underlying
ind-topological
module
of]
Ogp
(G)
determined
by
the
natural
action
of
Z×
[or,
equivalently,
maps
bijectively
onto
the
group
of
automorphisms
of
the
underlying
ind-topological
module
equipped
with
a
topological
group
action
of
G

O×
(G)
—
cf.
(b)].
On
the
other
hand,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
(d)
the
underlying
ind-topological
module
of
O×μ
(G)
is
divisible,
hence
admits
a
natural
action
by
Qp
.
In
particular,
if,
in
(b),
one
replaces
“O×
”
by
“O×μ
”,
then
the
resulting
description
of
the
kernel
is
false.
(ii)
In
the
present
series
of
papers,
we
shall
primarily
be
interested
in
Corollary
1.11
in
the
case
where
Γ
=
Z×
.
That
is
to
say,
allowing
for
a
Γ
(=
Z×
)-multiple
indeterminacy
corresponds
precisely
to
working,
in
the
case
of
G

O×
(G),
with
the
underlying
ind-topological
module
equipped
with
topological
group
action
[cf.
(i),
(b)].
Remark
1.11.2.
(i)
Observe
that,
in
the
context
of
the
discussion
of
Remark
1.11.1,
(i),
(b),
the
natural
action
of
Z×
on
[the
underlying
ind-topological
module
equipped
with
a
topological
group
action
of]
G

O×
(G)
is
compatible
with
pull-back
via
the
∼
composite
of
the
natural
surjection
Π

Π/Δ
with
any
isomorphism
Π/Δ
→
G
[cf.
INTER-UNIVERSAL
TEICHMÜLLER
THEORY
II
51
the
notation
of
Example
1.8].
That
is
to
say,
one
has
a
natural
action
of
Z×
on
[the
underlying
ind-topological
module
equipped
with
a
topological
group
action
of]
the
resulting
pair
Π

O×
(G).
Observe,
moreover,
that
this
action
of
Z×
fails
to
be
compatible
with
the
ring
structure
on
O×
(G)⊗Q
[i.e.,
the
ring
structure
determined
by
applying
the
p-adic
logarithm].
That
is
to
say,
even
though
this
ring
structure
on
“O×
”
may
[unlike
the
case
with
G!]
be
reconstructed
from
the
topological
group
Π
[cf.
[AbsTopIII],
Theorem
1.9],
the
natural
action
of
Z×
on
Π

O×
(G)
fails
to
preserve
the
ring
structure
reconstructed
from
Π.
(ii)
The
observations
of
(i)
are
of
interest
in
the
context
of
understanding
our
adoption
of
“G”
as
opposed
to
“Π”
in
the
construction
of
the
“Θ-link”
between
distinct
Θ-Hodge
theaters
given
in
[IUTchI],
Corollary
3.7.
That
is
to
say,
even
if
one
tries
to
“force
a
preservation
of
arithmetic
holomorphic
structures”
between
distinct
Θ-Hodge
theaters
by
working
with
“Π

O×
(G)”
instead
of
“G

O×
(G)”,
this
does
not
result
in
the
establishment
of
a
consistent
common
arithmetic
holomorphic
structure
for
distinct
Θ-Hodge
theaters,
since
the
establishment
of
such
a
consistent
common
arithmetic
holomorphic
structure
is
already
obstructed
by
the
fact
that
distinct
Θ-Hodge
theaters
only
share
a
common
“O×
”
[cf.
[IUTchI],
Corollary
3.7,
(iii)]
—
on
which
Z×
acts
[cf.
(i)]
—
i.e.,
as
opposed
to
a
common
“O
”.
Here,
we
recall
that
the
establishment
of
a
common
“O
”
is
obstructed,
in
a
quite
essential
manner,
by
the
“valuative
portion
†
Θv
→
‡
q
”
of
the
Θ-link
[cf.
[IUTchI],
Remark
v
3.8.1,
(i)].
Remark
1.11.3.
(i)
In
some
sense,
the
starting
point
of
any
discussion
of
radial
environments
is
the
description
of
the
radial
functor,
i.e.,
the
speciﬁcation
of
“which
portion
of
the
radial
data
one
takes
for
one’s
coric
data”.
From
the
point
of
view
of
the
theory
of
[IUTchI],
§3
[cf.,
especially,
the
portion
at
v
∈
Vbad
of
[IUTchI],
Corollaries
3.7,
3.9],
the
coric
data
should,
in
particular,
include
the
quotient
Π

Π/Δ
∼
=
G
of
the
topological
group
Π
isomorphic
to
Πtp
that
appears
in
a
Θ-Hodge
theater.
On
the
X
k
other
hand,
in
[IUTchIII],
we
shall
ultimately
be
interested
in
applying
the
theory
of
[AbsTopIII],
§3,
§5,
in
which
various
objects
[such
as
“Π

MTM
(Π)”,
“G

O
(G)”,
“G

O×
(G)”,
etc.]
are
constructed
group-theoretically
from
Π
or
G.
One
important
aspect
of
the
theory
of
[AbsTopIII],
§3,
§5,
is
that
after
these
objects
are
constructed
group-theoretically
from
Π
or
G,
one
then
proceeds
to
forget
the
“anabelian
structure”
of
these
objects,
i.e.,
one
forgets
the
data
consisting
of
the
way
in
which
these
objects
[such
as
MLF-Galois
TM-pairs,
MLF-Galois
TCGpairs,
etc.]
are
constructed
from
Π
or
G.
From
the
point
of
view
of
the
issue
of
“speciﬁcation
of
coric
data”,
if
one
takes,
for
instance,
“G”
to
be
a
part
of
one’s
coric
data,
then
any
objects
constructed
group-theoretically
from
G
may
also
be
regarded
naturally
as
constituting
a
portion
of
the
coric
data
—
so
long
as
one
regards
these
objects
as
being
equipped
with
the
corresponding
“anabelian
structures”
[i.e.,
the
data
that
speciﬁes
the
way
in
which
they
were
constructed
group-theoretically
from
G].
On
the
other
hand,
once
one
forgets
these
anabelian
structures,
it
is
no
longer
the
case
that
such
an
object
may
also
be
regarded
naturally
as
constituting
a
portion
of
the
coric
data.
That
is
to
say,
once
one
forgets
the
anabelian
structure
of
such
an
object,
it
is
necessary
to
specify
explicitly
that
such
an
object
is
to
52
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
be
regarded
as
a
portion
of
the
coric
data,
i.e.,
as
a
portion
of
the
radial
data
that
is
to
be
subject
to
the
“gluing”,
or
“identiﬁcation”,
discussed
in
Example
1.7,
(v).
(ii)
In
light
of
the
“coricity
of
O×
”
given
in
[IUTchI],
Corollary
3.7,
(iii),
in
addition
to
“G”,
it
is
possible
to
take
the
underlying
MLF-Galois
TCG-pair
of
“G

O×
(G)”
to
be
part
of
one’s
coric
data.
By
applying
Remark
1.11.1,
(i),
(b),
it
follows
that
this
amounts
to
working
with
“G

O×
(G)”
up
to
an
(Aut(G),
Γ
(=
Z×
))-indeterminacy
—
where
we
recall
from
Remark
1.8.1
that
the
p-adic
portion
of
the
Γ-indeterminacy
cannot
be
subsumed
into
the
Aut(G)-indeterminacy
[i.e.,
which
arises
from
the
fact
that
G
is
only
known
up
to
isomorphism
as
a
topological
group].
This
situation
is
precisely
the
situation
formulated
in
Example
1.8,
(iii).
On
the
other
hand,
as
we
saw
already
in
Corollary
1.10
[cf.
Remark
1.10.2],
and
as
we
shall
see
again
in
Corollary
1.12
below,
in
order
to
construct
certain
multiradially
deﬁned
functors
that
will
be
of
substantial
importance
in
the
development
of
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers,
it
is
necessary
to
form
the
quotient
of
“O×
(−)”
by
its
torsion
subgroup
“Oμ
(−)”,
i.e.,
to
work
with
“O×μ
(−)”,
rather
than
“O×
(−)”.
Here,
we
note
[cf.
Example
1.8,
(ix);
Remark
1.11.1,
(i),
(d)]
that
one
does
not
wish
here
to
work
solely
with
the
underlying
ind-topological
module
equipped
with
topological
group
action
determined
by
“G

O×μ
(G)”.
On
the
other
hand,
by
applying
[IUTchI],
Corollary
3.7,
(iii),
together
with
Remark
1.11.1,
(i),
(b),
one
concludes
that
it
is
possible
to
glue
together,
in
a
consistent
fashion,
the
various
“G

O×μ
(G)”
[cf.
Fig.
1.4]
arising
from
distinct
Θ-Hodge
theaters
up
to
an
(Aut(G),
Γ
(=
Z×
))-indeterminacy
[where
again
we
recall
from
Remark
1.8.1
that
the
p-adic
portion
of
the
Γ-indeterminacy
cannot
be
subsumed
into
the
Aut(G)-indeterminacy].
This
sort
of
situation
is
formulated
in
the
radial
environments
of
Example
1.8,
(v),
(vi),
(viii),
(ix)
[i.e.,
where
one
takes
“Γ×μ
”
to
be
the
image
Im(Γ)
of
Γ].
One
important
point
in
this
context
is
that
even
if
one
takes
“G

O×μ
(G)”
[i.e.,
as
opposed
to
“G

O
(G)”,
“G

Ogp
(G)”,
or
“G

O×
(G)”]
as
one’s
coric
data,
the
condition
of
compatibility
with
respect
to
the
natural
maps
Ogp
(G)
←
O×
(G)

O×μ
(G)
[cf.
Example
1.8,
(viii)]
implies
that
the
(Aut(G),
Γ
(=
Z×
))-indeterminacy
on
“G

O×μ
(G)”
induces
a
(Aut(G),
Γ
(=
Z×
))-indeterminacy
on
“G

O×
(G)”
and
“G

Ogp
(G)”
—
where
one
may
think
of
the
“Γ-indeterminacy
on
Ogp
(G)”
as
representing
the
“Γ-indeterminacy
in
the
speciﬁcation
of
the
submonoid
O
(G)
⊆
Ogp
(G)”.
It
is
precisely
these
indeterminacies
that
induce
the
indeterminacies
—
i.e.,
“orbits”
—
that
appear
in
Corollary
1.11,
(a),
(b),
in
sharp
contrast
to
the
“strict
cyclotomic
rigidity”
[i.e.,
without
any
indeterminacies]
of
Corollary
1.10
[cf.
Remark
1.10.2].
(iii)
Note
that
the
algorithms
applied
to
construct
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphisms
in
Corollaries
1.10
and
1.11,
(a),
are
obtained
by
composing
with
a
INTER-UNIVERSAL
TEICHMÜLLER
THEORY
II
53
group-theoretic
construction
algorithm
an
algorithm
whose
input
data
is
“postanabelian”
—
i.e.,
consists
of
a
type
of
mathematical
object
that
arises
upon
forgetting
the
anabelian
structure
determined
by
the
group-theoretic
construction
algorithm.
More
concretely,
this
post-anabelian
input
data
consists
of
a
system
of
mono-theta
environments
in
the
case
of
Corollary
1.10
and
of
an
MLF-Galois
TMpair
in
the
case
of
Corollary
1.11,
(a).
As
discussed
in
(ii),
the
indeterminacies
that
act
on
this
post-anabelian
input
data
induce
the
indeterminacies
—
i.e.,
“orbits”
—
that
appear
in
Corollary
1.11,
(a),
(b).
Put
another
way,
(a)
the
indeterminacies
—
i.e.,
“orbits”
—
that
appear
in
Corollary
1.11,
(a),
(b),
are
a
consequence
of
the
highly
nontrivial
relationship
[cf.
the
discussion
of
(ii)]
between
the
input
data
“O
(−)”
of
the
cyclotomic
rigidity
algorithm
involved
and
the
coric
data
“O×μ
(−)”.
By
contrast,
(b)
the
“strict
cyclotomic
rigidity”
asserted
in
Corollary
1.10
is
a
consequence
[cf.
Remark
1.10.2]
of
the
triviality
of
the
homomorphism
that
relates
the
cyclotomic
portion
of
“O
(−)”
—
which
is
the
only
portion
of
“O
(−)”
that
appears
in
a
mono-theta
environment
—
to
the
coric
data
“O×μ
(−)”.
Here,
it
is
important
to
note
that
although
frequently
in
discussions
of
various
“reconstruction
algorithms”
[such
as
group-theoretic
reconstruction
algorithms],
emphasis
is
placed
on
the
existence
of
“some”
reconstruction
algorithm,
the
present
discussion
of
the
multiradiality
of
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphisms
in
the
context
of
Corollaries
1.10,
1.11
yields
an
important
example
of
the
phenomenon
that
sometimes
not
only
the
existence
of
“some”
reconstruction
algorithm,
but
also
the
content
of
the
reconstruction
algorithm
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchIV],
Example
3.5]
is
of
crucial
importance
in
the
development
of
the
theory.
(iv)
Here,
we
note
in
passing
that
one
may
eliminate
the
(Aut(G),
Γ)-indeterminacy
of
Corollary
1.11,
(a),
(b),
by
working,
in
the
fashion
of
Example
1.9,
(iv),
(b),
with
uniradially
deﬁned
functors
[that
is
to
say,
in
the
case
of
Corollary
1.11,
(a),
(b),
replacing
“G

O
(G)”
by
“Π

MTM
(Π)”
and
“G”
by
“Π/Δ”
and
working
with
the
uniradial
environment
corresponding
to
the
assignment
×μ
(Π))
(Π

MTM
(Π))
→
(Π/Δ

MTM
—
i.e.,
for
which
the
deﬁnition
of
the
coric
data
coincides
with
the
deﬁnition
of
the
coric
data
of
the
multiradial
environment
in
the
statement
of
Corollary
1.11].
(v)
The
reason
[cf.
the
discussion
of
(iii)]
that
we
wish
to
consider
cyclotomic
rigidity
algorithms
whose
input
data
is
post-anabelian
is
that
we
wish
to
be
able
to
apply
the
same
algorithms
to
input
data
that
does
not
necessarily
arise
from
a
group-theoretic
construction
algorithm
—
e.g.,
to
input
data
that
arises
from
the
[divisor
and
rational
function]
monoid
portion
of
a
Frobenioid,
as
in
Proposition
1.3.
In
the
context
of
Proposition
1.3,
the
exterior
cyclotome
of
the
mono-theta
environment
that
appears
in
Corollary
1.10
and
the
cyclotome
arising
from
“O
(−)”
that
appears
in
Corollary
1.11,
(a),
both
correspond
to
the
same
cyclotome
“μN
(S)”
[which
arises
from
the
monoid
portion
of
the
Frobenioid
involved].
On
the
other
hand,
at
the
level
of
construction
algorithms,
in
order
to
relate
the
exterior
cyclo×
tome
“Πμ
(MΘ
∗
(Π))”
of
Corollary
1.10
to
the
cyclotome
“μZ
(O
(G))”
of
Corollary
54
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
1.11,
(a),
it
is
necessary
[cf.
Proposition
1.3,
(iii)]
to
pass
through
the
cyclotome
“(l
·
ΔΘ
)(Π)”
by
applying
the
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphisms
of
Corollaries
1.10,
1.11
—
which,
in
the
case
of
Corollary
1.11,
results
in
various
indeterminacies.
Put
another
way,
the
Frobenioid-theoretic
identiﬁcation
[i.e.,
via
“μN
(S)”]
of
Proposi×
tion
1.3
between
the
cyclotomes
“Πμ
(MΘ
∗
(Π))”,
“μZ
(O
(G))”
of
Corollaries
1.10;
1.11,
(a),
may
be
thought
of
either
as
being
only
uniradially
deﬁned
[cf.
(iv)],
or
as
multiradially
deﬁned,
but
only
up
to
certain
indeterminacies.
Remark
1.11.4.
(i)
One
way
to
understand
the
signiﬁcance
of
the
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphism
obtained
in
Corollary
1.10
—
i.e.,
of
the
triviality
of
the
homomorphism
that
relates
the
cyclotomic
portion
of
“O
(−)”
to
the
coric
data
“O×μ
(−)”
[cf.
Remark
1.11.3,
(iii),
(b)]
—
relative
to
the
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphism
of
Corollary
1.11,
which
involves
substantial
indeterminacies
arising
from
the
highly
nontrivial
relationship
between
the

(a)],
is
as
a
sort
of
splitting,
or
decoupling,
that
serves
to
separate
the
“purely
radial
data”
that
appears
in
the
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphism
of
Corollary
1.10
from
the
“purely
coric
data”
constituted

This
point
of
view
is
discussed
further
in
Remark

(vi),
below.
(ii)
From
the
point
of
view
of
the
discussion
of
Remark
1.9.2,
(iii),
the
“purely
radial
data”
that
appears
in
the
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphism
of
Corollary
1.10
depends
on
the
tautological
collection
of
“labels
of
all
possible
arithmetic
holomorphic
structures”.
That
is
to
say,
the
algorithms
of
Corollary
1.10
do
not
give
rise
to
a
“detailed,
explicit
description”
of
these
labels
in
terms
of
the
“purely
coric
data
O×μ
(−)”.
On
the
other
hand,
one
may
also
consider
a
modiﬁed
version
of
Corollary
1.10
in
which
(∗)
one
replaces
“O×μ
(−)”
by
“O×
(−)”
[i.e.,
so
that
the
crucial
triviality
discussed
in
Remark
1.11.3,
(iii),
(b),
no
longer
holds!]
and
applies
the
tautological
approach
discussed
in
Example
1.9,
(iv),
(a),
to
constructing
the
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphism
[without
indeterminacies!]
under
consideration.
If
one
works
with
this
modiﬁed
version
(∗),
then
the
codomain
of
the
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphism
under
consideration
may
be
thought
of
as
the
submodule
“Oμ
(−)”
of
the
“purely
coric
data
O×
(−)”,
equipped
with
a
“certain
rigidity”
that
depends
on
the
choice
of
an
element
of
the
collection
of
“labels
of
all
possible
arithmetic
holomorphic
structures”.
That
is
to
say,
whereas
Corollary
1.10
has
the
drawback
of
being
“not
entirely
free
of
label-dependence”,
the
signiﬁcance
of
Corollary
1.10
[as
stated!]
relative
to
the
tautological
modiﬁed
version
(∗)
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
label-dependence
inherent
in
Corollary
1.10
is
conﬁned
to
the
“purely
radial
component”
of
the
splitting,
or
decoupling,
discussed
in
(i)
—
i.e.,
unlike
the
case
with
(∗),
the
algorithms
of
Corollary
1.10
yield
a
“purely
coric
component”
that
is
free
of
such
“unwanted”
label-dependent
data.
Thus,
in
summary,
unlike
the
case
with
(∗),
the
algorithms
of
Corollary
1.10
yield
output
data
equipped
with
a
splitting,
or
decoupling,
into
label-dependent
[i.e.,
“purely
radial”]
and
label-independent
[i.e.
“purely
coric”]
components.

Remark
1.11.5.
Suppose
that
we
are
in
the
situation
of
Corollary
1.11.
(i)
Recall
the
natural
surjection
H
1
(G,
μZ
(G))

Z
—
which
is
constructed
via
a
functorial
group-theoretic
algorithm
in
[AbsTopIII],
Corollary
1.10,
(b).
That
is
to
say,
when
G
=
Gk
,
this
surjection
is
the
surjection
determined
by
the
valuation
of
k
on
the
image
of
the
natural
Kummer
map
k
×
→
H
1
(Gk
,
μZ
(Gk

—
where
we
recall
that
the
image
of
this
Kummer
map
is
equal
to
the
inverse
image
of
Z
⊆
Z
via
the
surjection
under
consideration.
In
particular,
the
existence
of
this
functorial
group-theoretic
algorithm
implies
that
the
data
consisting
of
this
natural
surjection
—
hence,
in
particular,
its
kernel,
i.e.,
“Ok×
”
—
may
be
formulated
as
a
corically,
hence,
in
particular,
as
a
multiradially
[cf.
Example
1.7,
(iv)],
deﬁned
functor.
[We
leave
the
routine
details
to
the
reader.]
(ii)
On
the
other
hand,
if
one
applies
the
isomorphisms
(∗bs-Gal

[cf.
also
the
bs-Gal
poly-isomorphism
α
of

and
(∗G,Π

of

1.11,
then
the

of

gives

to

which

that
may
be
formulated
either
as
a

deﬁned

[cf.

or,
when
considered
up
to
a
Z×

as
a
multiradially
deﬁned

[cf.
Corollary

In

the

of
these
natural

yield
data
that
may
be
formulated
as
a
multiradially
deﬁned

[We
leave

Remark
1.11.6.
The
importance
of
cyclotomic
rigidity
in
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers
is
interesting
in
light
of
the
analogy
between
the
ideas
of
the
present
series
of
papers
and
the
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
of
[pTeich]
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[AbsTopIII],
§I5].
Indeed,
the
proof
of
a
fundamental
absolute
p-adic
anabelian
result
concerning
the
canonical
curves
that
arise
in
the
theory
of
[pTeich]
[cf.
[CanLift],
Theorem
3.6]
depends,
in
an
essential
way,
on
a
certain
cyclotomic
rigidity
result
proven
in
an
earlier
paper
[cf.
[AbsAnab],
Lemma
2.5,
(ii)].
In
this
context,
we
observe
that
one
important
theme
that
appears
both
in
the
present
series
of
papers
and
in
the
theory
of
[CanLift],
§3,
is
the
idea
that
cyclotomes
should
be
thought
of
as
the
“skeleta
of
arithmetic
holomorphic
structures”
—
cf.
the
relation
of
S1
to
C×
in
the
complex
archimedean
theory.
We
are
now
ready
to
discuss
the
main
result
of

Also,
we
recall
from
the
proof
of
[EtTh],
Theorem

that
the

corresponding

are
reconstructed
by

the

reviewed
in
Proposition

[cf.
also
the
discussion
of

(iii)
By
contrast,
if,
in
the
context
of
the
discussion
of
(i),
the
normalization
reviewed
in
(ii)
consisted
of
the
requirement
that
certain

of

be
equal,
for

to

[where
we

that
the

cf.
[IUTchI],

then
the

although
[cf.
[AbsTopIII],
Corollary

[IUTchI],
Remark
3.1.2]
it
would
nonetheless
give
rise
to
a
uniradially

From
the
point
of
view
of
the
further
development
of
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers,
the
signiﬁcance
of
obtaining
“splittings
up
to
a
μ-indeterminacy”
may
be
summarized
as
follows.
Ultimately,
we
shall
be
interested,
in
[IUTchIII],
in
applying
the
theory
of
log-shells
developed
in
[AbsTopIII]
[cf.
Remark
1.12.1].
From
the
point
of
view
of
log-shells,
which
may
be
thought
of
as
being
contained
in
O×μ
(G),
an
indeterminacy
up
to
some
larger
subgroup
of
Ok×
—
such
as,
for
instance,
the
subgroup
generated
by
2
=
1
+
1,
together
with
its
Aut(G)conjugates
[cf.
the
discussion
of
(iii)]
—
would
imply
that
one
may
only
work,
in
an
inconsistent
fashion,
with
[for
instance,
the
image
of
the
log-shell
in]
the
quotient
of
O×μ
(G)
by
such
a
larger
subgroup
—
a
situation
which
is
unacceptable
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
further
development
of
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers.
(v)
The
discussion
in
(i),
(ii),
and
(iii)
above
of
the
multiradiality
of
the
crucial
splittings
(†μθ
)(Π)
of
Corollary
1.12,
(ii),
yields
another
important
example
[cf.
Remark
1.11.3,
(iii)]
of
the
phenomenon
that
sometimes
not
only
the
existence
of
a
single
reconstruction
algorithm,
but
also
the
content
of
the
reconstruction
algorithm
is
of
crucial
importance
in
the
development
of
the
theory.
Similar
ideas,
relative
to
the
point
of
view
of
the
theory
of
[EtTh],
may
also
be
seen
in
the
discussion
of
[EtTh],
Remarks
1.10.2,
1.10.4.
(vi)
In
general,
multiradiality
amounts
to
a
sort
of
“surjectivity”
[cf.
the
deﬁnition
of
a
multiradial
environment
via
a
“fullness”
condition

of

From
this

of
view,
the
content
of
the
multiradiality
of
the
splittings
(†μθ
)(Π)
of
Corollary
1.12,

may
be
thought
of
as
consisting
of
a
splitting
of
this
“surjection

From
the
point

the
discussion

it

is
useful
to
note
that
the

MTM

that
appear
in
Corollary

may
be
thought
of
as
[“roots”
of]
the
images,
via
the
Kummer
map,
of
a
certain
generating
subset
of
the
monoid
of
rational
functions
“OCΘ

deﬁned
in

which
is
used
to
construct
the
underlying
Frobenioid
of
the
split
Frobenioid
“FvΘ
”
—
cf.
also
the
discussion
of
Kummer
classes
in
[EtTh],
Proposition
5.2,

Here,
the
splittings

of
Corollary
1.12,

correspond
to
the
splitting
data
of
this
split
Frobenioid
FvΘ
.
Put
another
way,
this
monoidal
data
that
gives
rise
to
the
split
Frobenioid
FvΘ
may
be
thought
of
as
the
result
of
forgetting
the

the
discussion
of
Remark
1.11.3,
(i),
(ii);
the
theory
of
§3
below,
especially,
Proposition
3.4.
In
particular,
the
speciﬁcation
of
coric
data
“(G

O×μ
(G))”
in
the
multiradial
environment
that
appears
in
Corollary

arises
naturally
from
the
point
of
view
of
applying
the
“coricity
of

”
given
in
[IUTchI],
Corollary
3.7,
(iii),
as
in
the
discussion
of
Remark
1.11.3,
(ii).
Finally,
we
recall
from
the
discussion
of
Remark
1.11.3,
(ii),
that
this
speciﬁcation
of
coric
data
“(G

O×μ
(G))”
has
the
eﬀect
of
inducing,
in
particular,
an
(Aut(G),
Im(Z×
)
(⊆
Ism))-indeterminacy
on
“G

O×μ
(G)”
[cf.
Corollary
1.12,

Remark
1.12.4.
The
fact
that
the
“theta
evaluation”
functorial
algorithm
of
Corollary
1.12,
(ii),
given
by
restriction
to
the
decomposition
groups
associated
to
the
point
“μ−
”
involves
only
the
topological
group
“Π”
as
input
data
will
be
of
crucial
importance
when
we
combine
the
theory
developed
in
the
present
paper
with
the
theory
of
log-shells
[cf.
[AbsTopIII]]
in
[IUTchIII].
At
this
point,
it
is
useful
to
stop
and
consider
to
what
extent
this
sort
of
“group-theoretic
evaluation
algorithm”
is
an
inevitable
consequence
of
various
natural
conditions.
To
this
end,
let
us
suppose
that
we
are
given
some
“mysterious
evaluation
algorithm”
(abstract
theta
function)
→
(theta
values)
—
i.e.,
which
is
not
necessarily
given
by
restriction
to
the
decomposition
group
associated
to
a
closed
point.
Then
[cf.
[EtTh],
Remark
1.10.4;
the
theory
of
the
INTER-UNIVERSAL
TEICHMÜLLER
THEORY
II
61
“log-wall”,
as
discussed
in
[AbsTopIII],
§I4]
it
is
natural
to
require
[cf.,
especially,
the
point
of
view
of
the
discussion
of
Remark
1.12.3]
that
this
algorithm
be
compatible
with
the
operation
of
forming
Kummer
classes
by
extracting
N
-th
roots
of
the
“abstract
theta
function”
and
the
“theta
values”.
In
particular,
it
is
natural
to
require
that
this
algorithm
extend
to
coverings
[e.g.,
Galois
coverings]
on
both
the
input
and
output
data
of
the
algorithm.
But
then
the
natural
requirement
of
functoriality
with
respect
to
the
Galois
groups
on
either
side
leads
one
[cf.
Fig.
1.5
below],
in
eﬀect,
to
the
conclusion
—
which
we
shall
refer
to
as
the
principle
of
Galois
evaluation
—
that
the
“mysterious
evaluation
algorithm”
under
consideration
in
fact
arises
from
a
section
G
→
ΠŸ
(Π)
of
the
natural
surjection
ΠŸ
(Π)

G.
Moreover,
by
the
“Section
Conjecture”
of
anabelian
geometry,
one
expects
that
such
[continuous]
sections
G
→
ΠŸ
(Π)
necessarily
arise
from
geometric
points.
[Here,
we
pause
to
observe
that
this
relation
to
the
“Section
Conjecture”
is
interesting
in
light
of
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],
Example
4.5,
(i);
[IUTchI],
Remark
2.5.1.]
In
this
context,
it
is
useful
to
recall
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
theory
of
[AbsTopIII]
[cf.,
e.g.,
the
discussion
of
[AbsTopIII],
§I5],
the
group-theoreticity
of
the
evaluation
algorithm
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
abstract
analogue
of
the
condition,
in
the
p-adic
theory,
that
an
operation
involving
various
Frobenius
crystals
be
compatible
with
the
Frobenius
crystal
structures
[i.e.,
connection
and
Frobenius
action]

the
input
and

data
of
the
operation.

Recall
that
the
scheme-theoretic
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
reviewed
in
[HASurI],
[HASurII]
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
scheme-theoretic
version
of
the
well-known
classical
computation
of
the
Gaussian
integral

∞

=

√

−∞
—
i.e.,
by
thinking
of
the
square
of
this
integral
as
an
integral
over
the
cartesian
plane
R2
,
which
may
be
computed
easily
by
applying
a
coordinate
transformation
into
polar
coordinates.
That
is
to
say
[cf.
the
left-hand
and
middle
columns
of
Fig.
1.6
below],
the
main
theorem
of
scheme-theoretic
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
is
a
certain
comparison
isomorphism
[cf.
[HASurI],
Theorem
A]
between
a
“de

side”
—
62
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
which
consists
of
certain
sections
of
an
ample
line
bundle
on
the
universal
extension
of
an
elliptic
curve
—
and
an
“étale
side”
—
which
consists
of
arbitrary
functions
on
the
set
of
l-torsion
points
of
the
elliptic
curve
[where
l
is,
say,
some
odd
prime
number].
Here,
the
module
on
the
de
Rham
side
is
equipped
with
a
natural
Hodge
ﬁltration,
while
the
module
on
the
étale
side
is
equipped
with
a
natural
Galois
action
by
GL2
(Fl
).
The
ordered,
“step-like”
structure
of
the
Hodge
ﬁltration
is
reminiscent
of
the
cartesian
structure
of
the
plane
R2
,
i.e.,
regarded
as
an
ordered
collection
[parametrized
by
one
factor
of
R2
]
of
lines
[corresponding
to
the
other
factor
of
R2
].
On
the
other
hand,
the
GL2
(Fl
)-symmetry
of
the
étale
side
is
reminiscent
of
the
rotational
symmetry
of
the
representation
of
the
Gaussian
integral
on
the
plane
via
2
Gaussian
polar
coordinates.
Moreover,
the
function
“e−x
”
itself
appears
in
the
√
poles
that
appear
in
the
de
Rham
side
[cf.
[HASurI],
§1.1],
while
the
“
π”
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
the
[negative]
tensor
powers
of
the
sheaf
“ω”
of
invariant
diﬀerentials
on
the
elliptic
curve
that
appear
in
the
subquotients
of
the
Hodge
ﬁltration,
which
give
rise
to
a
Kodaira-Spencer
isomorphism
[cf.
[HASurII],
Theorems
2.8,
2.10]
between
ω
⊗2
and
the
restriction
to
the
base
scheme
of
the
sheaf
of
logarithmic
diﬀerentials
on
the

stack
of
elliptic
curves
—
i.e.,
between
ω
and
the
“square
root”
of
this
sheaf
of
logarithmic
diﬀerentials.
Finally,
we
recall
that
this
relationship
between
the
theory
of
[HASurI],
[HASurII]
and
the
classical
Gaussian
integral
may
be
seen
more
explicitly
when
this
theory
is
restricted
to
the

of

Section
2:
Galois-theoretic
Theta
Evaluation
In
the
present
§2,
we
develop
the
theory
of
group-theoretic
algorithms
surrounding
the
Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic
evaluation
of
the
étale
theta
function
on
l-torsion
points.
At
a
more
technical
level,
this
theory
depends
on
a
careful
analysis
of
the
issue
of
conjugate
synchronization
[cf.
Remark
2.6.1]
—
i.e.,
of
synchronizing
conjugates
of
various
copies
of
objects
associated
to
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
the
base
ﬁeld
that
occur
at
the
evaluation
points
—
as
well
as
on
the
computation,
via
the
theory
of
[IUTchI],
§2,
of
various
conjugacy
indeterminacies
[cf.
Corollaries
2.4,
2.5]
that
arise
from
the
consideration
of
certain
closed
subgroups
of
various
topological
groups.
In
fact,
these
various
technical
issues
arise,
ultimately,
as
a
consequence
of
the
requirement
of
performing
the
HodgeArakelov-theoretic
evaluation
in
question
with
respect
to
a
single
basepoint
[cf.
the
discussions
of
Remark
1.12.4;
[IUTchI],
Remark
6.12.6].
This
Hodge-Arakelovtheoretic
evaluation
will
play
a
central
role
in
the
theory
developed
in
the
present
series
of
papers.
In
the
present
§2,
we
shall
work
mainly
with
the
local
portion
at
v
∈
Vbad
of
the
various
mathematical
objects
considered
in
[IUTchI],
§3,
§4,
§5,
§6.
In
fact,
however,
many
of
the
constructions
carried
out
in
the
present
§2
will
be
valid
for
strictly
local
data
[as
in
§1],
i.e.,
that
does
not
necessarily
arise
from
global
data
over
a
number
ﬁeld.
Nevertheless,
in
order
to
keep
the
notation
simple
from
the
point
of
view
of
discussing
the
compatibility
of
the
theory
of
the
present
§2
with
the
theory
of
[IUTchI],
we
shall
carry
out
the
discussion
of
the
present
§2
only
for
the
localized
objects
that
arise
from
the
theory
of
[IUTchI],
§3,
§4,
§5,
§6,
leaving
the
routine
details
of
a
corresponding
purely
local
theory
to
the
interested
reader.

The

that

in
the


Remark
2.1.1.
In
the
notation
of
Proposition
2.1:
(i)
Recall
that
the
special
ﬁber
of
any
model
of
Ÿv
that
arises
from
a
stable
model
of
X
v
consists
of
a
chain
of
copies
of
the
projective
line
joined
together
at
the
points
“0”,
“∞”
[cf.
the
discussion
preceding
[EtTh],
Proposition
1.1].
The
set
of
irreducible
components
of
this
special
ﬁber
may
be
thought
of
as
a
torsor
over
the
group
Z.
Moreover,
the
natural
action
of
Gal(Ÿv
/Yv
)
∼
=
{±1}
on
Ÿv
ﬁxes
each
of
the
irreducible
components
of
the
special
ﬁber
of
Ÿv
and
ﬁts
into
an
exact
sequence
1
→
Gal(Ÿv
/Yv
)
→
Gal(Ÿv
/X
v
)
→
Gal(Yv
/X

)
→
1,
where
Gal(Yv
/X
v
)
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
subgroup
l
·Z
⊆
Z.
Since
the
degree
l
covering
X
v
→
X
v
is
totally
ramiﬁed
at
the
cusps,
it
thus
follows
that
each
of
the
maps
ΓŸ
→
ΓY
;
ΓŸ
→
ΓY

ΓŸ
→
ΓŸ
;
ΓY

dual
graphs
associated
to
the
special
ﬁbers
of
stable

[where
we
omit
the
various
subscript
“v’s”
in
order
to
simplify
the
notation]
determined
by
the
various
coverings
discussed
in
Proposition
2.1
induces
a
bijection
on
vertices.
(ii)
Let
ιX
,
ιX
,
ιŸ
be
as
in
Remark
1.4.1,
where
we
take
“X
k
”
to
be
X
v
.
Write
ιŸ
for
the
automorphism
of
Ÿv
induced
by
ιŸ
;
Γ
X
⊆
ΓX
for
the
unique
connected
subgraph
of
ΓX
which
is
a
tree
that
is
stabilized
by
ιX
and
contains
every
vertex
of
ΓX
;
Γ•X
⊆
Γ
X
for
the
unique
connected
subgraph
of
ΓX
stabilized
by
ιX
that
contains
precisely
one
vertex
and
no
edges.
Thus,
if
one
thinks
of
the
vertices
of
ΓX
as
being
labeled
by
elements
∈
{−l

—
where
the
vertex
labeled
0
is
ﬁxed
by

—
then
Γ
X
is
obtained
from
ΓX
by
eliminating
the
unique
edge
joining
the
vertices
with
labels
±l
;
Γ•X
consists
of
the
unique
vertex
0
and
no
edges.
In
particular,
by
taking
appropriate
connected
66
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
components
of
inverse
images,
one
concludes
[cf.
(i)]
that
Γ
X
determines
ﬁnite,
connected
subgraphs
Γ•X
⊆
Γ
X
⊆
ΓX
,
Γ•Ÿ
⊆
Γ
⊆
ΓŸ
,
Ÿ
Γ•Ÿ
⊆

of
the

corresponding

,
Ÿ
v
which
are
stabilized
by
the
respective
“inversion
automorphisms”
ιX
,
ιŸ
,
ιŸ
.
Here,
each
subgraph
Γ•(−)
consists
of
precisely
one
vertex
and
no
edges,
while
the
set
of
vertices
of
each
subgraph
Γ
(−)
maps
bijectively
to
the
set
of
vertices
of
Γ
.
In
fact,
[although
we
shall
not
use
this
X
fact
in
the
present
series
of
papers]
it
is
not
diﬃcult
to
verify,
by
considering
the
divisibility
at
the
edges
[i.e.,
nodes]
of
the
divisor
of
poles
of
the
theta
function
[cf.
[EtTh],
Proposition
1.4,
(i)],
that

each
subgraph
Γ
(−)
maps
isomorphically
to
ΓX
.
Proposition

In
the
notation
of
Proposition
2.1,
write
Πv•

⊆
Πv
for
the
decomposition
groups
determined,
respectively,
by
the

i.e.,
more
precisely,
the
group
“ΠX,H

of

Corollary

where
we
take

“H”
to
be
Γ•X
or
Γ
X
,
“Σ”
to
be
{l},
and
“Σ”
to
be
Primes.
Thus,
Πv
is
well-deﬁned
up
to
Πv

once
one
ﬁxes
Πv
,
then
the
subgroup
Πv•

The

(b)
=⇒

are
immediate
from
the

Thus,
it
suﬃces
to

verify
that
(c)
=⇒
(a),
i.e.,
that
the
condition
Itγ·γ

)
implies
that
γ
∈
Δv
;
we
may
assume
without

that
γ

Then
by
[IUTchI],
Corollary

[cf.
also
[IUTchI],
Remark
2.5.2],
the
inclusion
Itγ
⊆
Π±

⊆

implies
that
γ
∈

v
.
Now,
by
applying
the
equivalence
of
[IUTchI],
Corollary
2.3,
(vi)
[cf.

to

it
follows
that
γ

hence
that
γ

This

replace

its
maximal

subgroup
for
any

\
{pv

The
use
of
such
maximal

sometimes
results
in
a
simpliﬁcation
of
arguments
involving
intersections
with
other
closed

since
every

is
either
open

in
that
they
satisfy
the
following
crucial
property
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
1.12.2]:
the
ratio
Θ̈(c)/Θ̈(c

is
a
root
of
unity,
for
any
c
∈
Kv
[corresponding
to
a
point

that
occurs
as
the

of

of

to
[the
point
of

to]

such
that
c

a
unit.

is
to
say,
the
reciprocals
of
the

powers
of
the
theta

discussed

[i.e.,

Note
that,

the

One
way
to
visualize
the

Fig.

Independent

That
is
to
say,
one
thinks
of
the
upper
and
lower
lines
of
Fig.
2.1
as
being
equipped
with
independent
actions
by
groups
of
horizontal
translations
[i.e.,
each

to

one
thinks
of
each
of

in
the
upper

as
representing
a
Δ±
∼
=
Δ±
v

Thus,
since
the
translation

the
upper

are
not
synchronized
with
one
another
[cf.
the
discussion

there
is
no
way
to
separate
—
i.e.,
in
a
fashion
that
is
compatible
with
the
indeterminacy
arising
from
both
translation
actions
—
the
inclusion
of
a
“◦”
into
a
“•

•”
as
the
left-hand
“•”
from
the
inclusion
of
the

“◦”
into
some
“•

as
the
right-hand

We

the

in

the

may
be

as
arising
from
the
requirement
that
the

be
treated
as
a
single
uniﬁed

whose

described
by
considering
the
action
of
a

group
in
the
context
of
the
simultaneous
extraction
of
N

roots
of
all
theta
values,
relative
to
a
single
cyclotome
[i.e.,
copy
of
the

roots
of

that
acts
simultaneously
on
the
N

roots
of
all

in
a
fashion

of
a
single

component
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Galois
evaluation
in
Remark
1.12.4;
the
discussion
of
[EtTh],
Remark
1.10.4].
Also,
we
recall
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Galois
evaluation
in
Remark
1.12.4]
that
this
“Kummer-theoretic
representation”
of
the
[“Frobenioid-theoretic”]
monoid
generated
by
the
[“Frobenioid-theoretic”]
theta
function
satisﬁes
the
crucial
property
of
being
compatible
[unlike
the
various
ring
structures
involved!]
with
the
“log-wall”
[cf.
the
theory
of
[AbsTopIII]].
This
crucial
property
will
play
a
fundamental
role
in
the
theory
to
be
developed
in
[IUTchIII].
Remark
2.6.2.
(i)
In
the
context
of
the
discussion
of

in

it

from

it
is

to
think
(a)

as
corresponding

of
[IUTchI],
Proposition
6.8,
(i).
Relative
to
the
interpretation
of
(a),
(b),
and
(c),
one
has
the
following
fundamental
observation
concerning
the
discussion
of
Remark
2.6.1:
the
single
basepoint
that
underlies
the
conjugate
synchronization
discussed
in
Remark
2.6.1
is
compatible
with
the
single
basepoint
that
underlies
the
label
synchronization
discussed
in
[IUTchI],
Remark
6.12.4.
That
is
to
say,
both
of
these
basepoints
may
be
thought
of
as
arising
from
a
single
basepoint
that
gives
rise
to
the
various
topological
groups
Πv
,
Π±
v
,
etc.
that
appear
in
Corollaries
2.4,
2.5,
and
2.6.
In
particular,
the
conjugate
synchronization
discussed
in
Remark
2.6.1
is
compatible
with
the
F±
l
-symmetry
of
[IUTchI],
Proposition
6.8,
(i)
[cf.
also
Remark
3.8.3
below].
Indeed,
this
compatibility
is
essentially
the
content
of
Corollary
2.4,
(iii)
[cf.
(c)
above].
(ii)
Note
that
the
compatibility
of
basepoints
discussed
in
(i)
contrasts
sharply
with
the
incompatibility
of
the
conjugate
synchronization
basepoint
of
Remark
2.6.1
with
the
F
l
-symmetry
of
[IUTchI],
Proposition
4.9,
(i),
in
the
case
of
D-ΘNF-Hodge

theaters.
At
a
more
concrete
level,
this
diﬀerence
between
F±
l
-
and
Fl
-symmetries
may
be
understood
as
a
consequence
of
the
fact
that
whereas
the
F±
l
-symmetry
is
deﬁned
relative
to
a
single
copy
of
a
local
geometric
object
at
v
—
i.e.,
“Π±
v”

[cf.
(a),
(b),
(c)
above]
—
the
Fl
-symmetry
involves
permuting
multiple
copies
of
local
geometric
objects
in
such
a
way
that
one
may
only
identify
these
multiple
copies
with
one
another
at
the
expense
of
allowing
the
phenomenon
of
“label
crushing”
[cf.
the
discussions
of
[IUTchI],
Remark
4.9.2,
(i),
(ii);
6.12.6,
(i),
(ii),
(iii)].
(iii)
Another
important
property
of
the
F±
l
-symmetry
—
which
is
not
satisﬁed

±
by
the
Fl
-symmetry!
—
is
that
the
Fl
-symmetry
allows
comparison
with
the
label
zero
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],
Remark
6.12.5],
hence,
in
particular,
comparison
with
the
copies
of
“O×
”
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
1.12.2]
that
k
occur
in
the
splittings
of
Corollary
1.12,
(ii),
that
give
rise
to
the
crucial
constant
multiple
rigidity
of
the

theta
function.
This
important
property
is
precisely
the
content
of
Corollary

Remark
2.6.3.
(i)
The
discussion
of
independent
conjugacy
indeterminacies
in
Remark
2.5.2
and
of
“single
basepoints”
that
are
compatible
with
the
F±
l
-symmetry
of
[IUTchI],
§6,
in
Remarks
2.6.1,
2.6.2
imply
rather
severe
restrictions
concerning
the
sub⊆
ΓŸ
”
of
Remark
2.1.1,
(ii).
That
is
to
say,
suppose
that
one
attempts
graph
“Γ
Ÿ
to
develop
the
theory
of
the
present
§2
for
another
subgraph
Γ
of
the
graph
ΓŸ
.
Recall
from
the
discussion
of
Remark
2.1.1,
(i),
that
the
graph
ΓŸ
may
be
thought
of
as
a
“copy
of
the
real
line
R”,
in
which
the
integers
Z
⊆
R
are
taken
to
be
the
vertices,
and
the
line
segments
joining
the
integers
are
taken
to
be
the
edges.
Then
the
discussion
of
“single
basepoints”
[cf.
Remark
2.6.1]
implies,
ﬁrst
of
all,
that
(a)
this
subgraph
Γ
must
be
connected.
Since,
moreover,
one
wishes
to
consider
the
crucial
splittings
of
Corollary
2.6,
(ii)
[cf.
Remark
2.6.2,
(iii)],
it
follows
that
(b)
this
subgraph
Γ
must
contain
the
vertex
of
ΓŸ
labeled
“0”.
The
conditions
(a)
and
(b)
already
impose
substantial
restrictions
on
Γ
and
hence
on
the
collection
of
values
of
the
étale
theta
function
that
may
arise
by
restricting
to
the
μ−
-translates
of
the
cusps
that
lie
in
Γ
[cf.
Remark
2.5.1,
(ii)]
—
i.e.,
on
the
collection
of
q
j2
v
obtained
by
allowing
j
∈
Z
to
range
[relative
to
the
identiﬁcation
of
the
vertices
of
ΓŸ
with
the
integral
points
of
the
real
line]
over
the
“vertices”
of
Γ
[cf.
Remark
2.5.1,
(i)].
(ii)
By
abuse
of
notation,
let
us
write
“j
∈
Γ
”
for
“vertices”
j
∈
Z
that
lie
in
Γ
.
Also,
for
simplicity,
let
us
assume
that
the
subgraph
Γ
is
ﬁnite
[cf.
(iii)
below].
Then
ultimately,
in
the
theory
of
[IUTchIV],
when
we
consider
various
height
inequalities,
we
shall
be
concerned
with
the
issue
of
maximizing
the
quantity

def
min
{
j
2
}
||Γ
||
=
|Γ
|−1
·
j∈F
l
j∈j
Γ
—
where
we
write
|Γ
|
for
the
cardinality
of
the
image
in
F
l
of
the
nonzero
elements
of
Γ
;
we
regard
the
“min”
over
an
empty
set
as
being
equal
to
zero;
we
think
of
the
various
j
∈
F
l
as
corresponding
to
the
subsets
of
Z
determined
by
the
ﬁbers
of
the
natural
projection
Z

|Fl
|
(⊇
F
l
).
Here,
we
observe
that
(c)
the
set
of
“j’s”
that
occur
in
the
“min”
ranging
over
“j”
[i.e.,
not
over
“j”!]
that
appears
in
the
deﬁnition
of
||Γ
||
is
always
equal
to
a
ﬁber
of
the
restriction
to
the
set
of
vertices
of
Γ
of
the
natural
projection
Z

|Fl
|.
In
fact,
this
observation
(c)
is,
in
essence,
a
consequence
of
the
phenomenon
discussed
in
Remark
2.5.2
of
independent
conjugacy
indeterminacies
[cf.,
especially,
Remark
2.5.2,
(iv)]
—
i.e.,
roughly
speaking,
that
80
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
one
cannot
restrict
the
étale
theta
function
to
“one
j
∈
Γ
”
without
also
restricting
the
étale
theta
function
to
the
various
“other
j
∈
Γ
”
that
lie
in
the
same
ﬁber
over
|Fl
|.
Next,
let
us
make
the
[easily
veriﬁed
—
cf.
(a),
(b)!]
observation
that
if
one
thinks
of
||Γ
||
as
a
function
of
|Γ
|,
then
as
|Γ
|
ranges
over
the
positive
integers,
it
holds
that
(d)
the
function
of
|Γ
|
constituted
by
||Γ
||
—
which
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
average
—
is
a
monotone
increasing
[but
not
strictly
increasing!]
function
of
|Γ
|
valued
in
the
positive
rational
numbers
which
attains
its
maximum
when
|Γ
|
=
l
and
is
constant
for
|Γ
|
≥
l
.
Now
it
follows
formally
from
(d)
that,
as
|Γ
|
ranges
over
the
positive
integers,
the
quantity
||Γ
||
attains
its
maximum
when
|Γ
|
=
l
—
hence,
in
particular,
when
.
Thus,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
issue
of
maximizing
this
Γ
is
taken
to
be
Γ
Ÿ
[cf.
also
quantity
||Γ
||,
there
is
“no
loss
of
generality”
in
assuming
that
Γ
=
Γ
Ÿ
the
discussion
of
(iv)
below].
(iii)
Although
in
the
discussion
of
(ii)
above
we
assumed
that
Γ
is
ﬁnite,
this
assumption
does
not
in
fact
result
in
any
loss
of
generality.
Indeed,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
||Γ
||
is
deﬁned,
ﬁnite,
and
satisﬁes
the
evident
analogue
of
(d)
even
for
inﬁnite
Γ
.
Thus,
the
case
of
inﬁnite
Γ
may
be
excluded
without
loss
of
generality.
(iv)
Ultimately,
in
§4
of
the
present
paper,
we
shall
be
concerned
with
the
issue
of
globalizing,
via
the
construction
of
various
global
realiﬁed
Frobenioids,
the
monoids
determined
by
the
theta
values
at
v
∈
Vbad
that
appear
in
the
present
§2.
This
globalization
will
be
achieved,
in
eﬀect,
by
imposing
the
condition
that
the
product
formula
be
satisﬁed.
On
the
other
hand,
the
indeterminacies
discussed
in
(ii)
above
[cf.,
especially,
(ii),
(c)]
that
arise
when
a
ﬁber
of
Γ
over
|Fl
|
contains
more
than
one
element
are
easily
seen
to
be
fundamentally
incompatible
with
the
product
formula.
In
particular,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
issue
of
maximizing
the
quantity
||Γ
||,
in
fact
the
only
choice
for
Γ
that
is
compatible
with
the
.
“globalization
via
the
product
formula”
to
be
performed
in
§4
is
Γ
Ÿ
(v)
One
may
summarize
the
discussion
of
(i),
(ii),
(iii),
and
(iv)
as
follows:
j2
the
collection
of
values
“q
”
of
the
étale
theta
function
determined
by
the
v

subgraph
ΓŸ
is
of
a
highly
distinguished
nature
—
and,
indeed,
is
essentially
determined
[cf.
the
discussion
at
the
end
of
(ii);
the
discussion
of
(iv)]
by
the
requirement
of
maximizing
the
quantity
“||Γ
||”
in
a
fashion
compatible
with
the
global
product
formula,

with

considerations

Remark
2.8.1.
One
may
regard
Corollaries
2.5,
2.6
as
a
special
case
of
Corollary
2.8,
i.e.,
the
case
where
the
projective
system
of
mono-theta
environments
MΘ
∗
arises
from
the
topological
group
Πv
by
applying
the
functorial
group-theoretic
algorithm
of
Proposition
1.2,
(i)
[cf.
also
Proposition
1.5,
(i)].
Remark
2.8.2.
The
signiﬁcance
of
the
mono-theta-theoretic
version
of
Corollaries
2.5,
2.6
constituted
by
Corollary
2.8
lies
in
the
fact
that
this
mono-thetatheoretic
version
allows
one
to
relate
the
group-theoretic
theta
evaluation
theory
of
the
present
§2
to
the
theory
of
Frobenioid-theoretic
theta
functions
associated
to
tempered
Frobenioids
[cf.
[EtTh],
§5],
i.e.,
by
considering
the
case
where
MΘ
∗
arises
from
a
tempered
Frobenioid
[cf.
Proposition
1.2,
(ii)].
For
instance,
by
considering
the
case
where
MΘ
∗
arises
from
a
tempered
Frobenioid,
one
may
treat
the
Frobenioid-theoretic
cyclotomes
[i.e.,
cyclotomes
that
arise
from
the
units
of
the
Frobenioid]
of
Proposition
1.3,
(i),
in
the
context
of
the

of
the
present
§2.
Remark

of
the

[cf.

reminiscent
of
the

the

sections
of
an
arithmetic
line
bundle
on
a
number
ﬁeld
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Szp],
pp.

as
well
as
of
the

inherent
in
the

theory
associated

[cf.
[SemiAnbd],
Remark

in

involving
the

“archimedean”
line
segment
Γ
X
⊆
ΓX
[cf.
Remark
2.6.1
for
more
on
the
importance
of
this
connectedness]
depends,
in
an
essential
way,
on
the
discreteness
of
Z
(∼
=
Z).
Put
another
way,
this
sort
of
argument
may
be
thought
of
as
an
application
of
the
discrete
rigidity
that
forms
one
of
the
central
themes
of
[EtTh].
Note,
moreover,
that
in
the
context
of
Corollary
2.8,
this
application
of
discrete
rigidity
is
closely
related
to
the
application
of
cyclotomic
rigidity.
This
is
perhaps
not
so
surprising,
since
discrete
rigidity
—
in
the
form
of
the
discreteness
of
squares
of
elements
of
Z,
i.e.,
in
eﬀect,
the
quotient
of
Z
by
the
action
of
{±1}
—
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
dual
property
to
the
cyclotomic
rigidity
of
“(l
·
ΔΘ
)(−)”.
Indeed,
one
84
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
may
think
of
this
duality
as
being
embodied
in
the
very
structure
and
values
of
the
étale
theta
function
[cf.
[EtTh],
Proposition
1.4,
(ii),
(iii);
[EtTh],

In
a
similar
vein,
one
may
also
consider
the
theory
of
group-theoretic
theta
evaluation
developed
in
the
present
§2
in
the
context
of
the
natural

admit

[the

admit

the
observation
that,
at

the

On

one
important

is
the
result
that,

In

we
relate
the
theory
of
group-theoretic
algorithms
surrounding
the
Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic
evaluation
of
the
étale

of
the
various
Frobenioids
considered
in

§3,
§4,
§5,
§6.
In

we
shall
discuss
how
the
various
multiradial
formulations
developed
in
§1
and
the
theory
of
conjugate
synchronization
developed
in
§2
may
be
applied
in
the

that
arise
from
the
Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic
evaluation
of
the

In
the

we
shall
continue
to
use
the

Before

from

the

One

the
result
that,

one
may
construct
certain

the

The
various

follow
immediately
from

and
the

quoted
in

of

Remark
3.5.1.
(i)
Note
that
in
Corollary
3.5,
unlike
the
situation
of
Corollary
2.8,
we
took
γ
to
be
=
1.
This
was
done
primarily
to
simplify
the
notation
and
does
not
result
in
any
substantive
loss
of
generality.
Indeed,
one
may
always
simply
take
the
“MΘ
∗
”
of
Θ
γ
Corollary
3.5
to
be
the
“(M∗
)
”
of
Corollary
2.8.
Alternatively,
one
may
observe
δ

that
occurs
in
the
various
restriction
that
the
“δ”
that
appears
in
the
“Dt,μ
−
operations
invoked
in
Corollary
3.5
[cf.
Corollary
2.8,
(i),
(ii)]
is
arbitrary,
i.e.,
it
is
subject
to
the
independent
conjugation
indeterminacies
discussed
in
Corollary
2.5,
(iii);
Remark
2.5.2.
(ii)
In
the
present
context,
it
is
useful
to
recall
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],
Remark
3.2.3,
(i),
the
various
ΠX
(MΘ
∗
)-conjugacy
indeterminacies
that
appear
in
Corollary
3.5
are
applied,
in
the
context
of
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers,
to
identify
the
various
ΠX
(MΘ
∗
)-conjugates
Θ
of
Πv
¨
(M∗
¨
)
[or,
alternatively,
“ι’s”]
with
one
another.
Remark
3.5.2.
Before
proceeding,
it
is
useful
to
pause
to
consider
the
signiﬁcance
of
the
symmetrizing
isomorphisms
of
Corollary
3.5,
(i).
(i)
We
begin
by
discussing
a
simple
combinatorial
model
of
the
phenomenon
of
interest.
Consider
the
totally
ordered
set
E
=
{0,
1}
whose
ordering
is
completely
determined
by
the
inequality
0
<
1
—
which
we
shall
denote,
in
the
following
discussion,
by
the
notation
“≺”.
Then
one
may
consider
labeled
copies
≺0
,
≺1
of
≺.
Now
suppose
that
one
attempts
to
identify
these
labeled
copies
≺0
,
≺1
by
simply
forgetting
the
labels.
This
amounts,
in
eﬀect,
to
sending
the
two
distinct
subscripted
labels
E

0,
1
→
∗
to
a
single
point
“∗”.
In
particular,
this
naive
approach
to
identifying
the
labeled
copies
≺0
,
≺1
fails
to
be
compatible
—
in
a
sense
that
we
shall
examine
in
more
detail
in
the
discussion
to
follow
—
with
operations
that
require
one
to
distinguish
the
two
labels
0,
1
∈
E.
Now
if,
to
avoid
confusion,
one
writes
S
for
the
underlying
set
of
E
[i.e.,
obtained
from
E
by
forgetting
the
ordering
on
E],
then
one
has
a
natural
Aut(S)-orbit
of
bijections
∼
E
→
S

Aut(S)
—
where
Aut(S)
∼
=
Z/2Z.
Next,
let
us
suppose
that
we
are
given
an
object
F
(≺)
functorially
constructed
from
[the
“totally
ordered
set
of
cardinality
two”]
≺.
Then
INTER-UNIVERSAL
TEICHMÜLLER
THEORY

97
any
“factorization”
of
the
functorial
construction
F
(−)
[i.e.,
on
“totally
ordered
sets
of
cardinality
two”]
through
a
functorial
construction
F
sym
(S)

Aut(S)
on
unordered
sets
of
cardinality
two
[i.e.,
relative
to
the
“forgetful
functor”
that
associates
to
an
ordered
set
the
underlying
unordered
set]
may
be
thought
of
as
a
collection
of
“symmetrizing
isomorphisms”
[cf.
the
discussion
of
(ii)
below;
Corollary
3.5,
(i)],
or,
alternatively,
as
“descent
data”
for
F
(−)
from
E
to
the
“orbiset
quotient”
of
S
by
Aut(S).
Moreover,
this
“descent
data”
satisﬁes
the
crucial
property
that
it
allows
one
to
perform
this
“descent
to
the
orbiset
quotient”
in
such
a
way
that
one
is
never
required
to
violate
the
bijective
relationship
—
albeit
via
an
indeterminate
bijection!
—
between
E
and
S.
By
contrast,
the
“naive
approach”
discussed
above
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
working
with
the
“coarse
set-theoretic
quotient”
Q
of
S
by
Aut(S)
def
—
which
we
shall
think
of
as
consisting
of
a
single
point
∗
=
{0,
1}
∈
Q
=
{∗}.
def
Now
suppose,
for
instance,
in
the
case
F
(≺)
=
≺,
that
one
attempts
to
regard
def
F
(≺)(−)
=
≺(−)
[where
(−)
∈
S]
as
an
object
“pulled
back”
from
a
copy
≺Q
[i.e.,
“0Q
<
1Q
”]
of
≺
over
Q.
On
the
other
hand,
if
one
wishes
to
relate
each
point
def
s
∈
S
to
one
or
more
points
∈
EQ
=
{0Q
,
1Q
}
via
an
Aut(S)-equivariant
assignment
in
such
a
way
that
every
point
of
EQ
appears
in
the
image
of
this
assignment,
then
one
has
no
choice
but
to
assign
to
each
point
s
∈
S
the
collection
of
all
points
∈
EQ
.
Put
another
way,
one
must
contend
with
an
independent
indeterminacy
s
→
0Q
?
1Q
?
for
each
s
∈
S
—
i.e.,
if
we
write
S
=
{0S
,
1S
},
then
these
indeterminacies
give
rise
to
a
total
of
4
possibilities
0S
→
0Q
?
1Q
?
1S
→
0Q
?
1Q
?
for
the
desired
assignment,
certain
of
which
[i.e.,
0S
,
1S
→
0Q
and
0S
,
1S
→
1Q
]
fail
to
be
bijective.
Here,
it
is
useful
to
note
that
to
synchronize
these
indeterminacies
amounts,
tautologically,
to
the
requirement
of
an
“automorphism
of
≺Q
that
induces
the
unique
nontrivial
automorphism
of
the
set
EQ
=
{0Q
,
1Q
}”.
On
the
other
hand,
by
the
deﬁnition
of
an
“inequality”,
it
is
a
tautology
that
such
an
automorphism
of
≺Q
cannot
exist.
Finally,
in
this
context,
it
is
useful
to
recall
that
this
diﬀerence
between
“crushing
the
set
E
to
a
single
point”
and
“symmetrizing
without
violating
the
bijective
relationship
to
E”
is
precisely
the
topic
of
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],
Remark
4.9.2,
(i);
[IUTchI],
Remark
6.12.4,
(i)
—
cf.,
especially,
[IUTchI],
Fig.
4.5.
(ii)
The
starting
point
of
the
theory
surrounding
the
symmetrizing
isomorphisms
of
Corollary
3.5,
(i),
is
the
connectedness
—
or
“single
basepoint”
—
observed
in
the
discussion
of
Remark
2.6.1,
(i),
together
with
the
compatibility
of
this
connectedness
with
a
certain
F±
l
-symmetry,
as
discussed
in
Remark
2.6.2,
98
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
(i).
These
symmetrizing
isomorphisms
may
be
applied
to
labeled
copies
of
variΘ
Θ
Θ
ous
objects
constructed
from
MΘ
∗
—
e.g.,
Ψcns
(M∗
),
Gv
(M∗
),
Πμ
(M∗
)
—
cf.
the
discussion
of
“conjugate
synchronization”
in
Remark
2.6.1,
(i).
Note
that
in
the
absence
of
the
F±
l
-symmetry
involved,
the
“single
basepoint”
under
consideration
has
a
rigidifying
eﬀect
not
only
on
the
various
conjugates
involved,
but
also
on
the
labels
under
consideration.
That
is
to
say,
a
priori,
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
desired
rigidity
of
the
conjugates
involved
depends
on
the
rigidity
of
the
labels
under
consideration.
Indeed,
this
is
precisely
what
happens
when
the
data
that
one
wishes
to
synchronize
—
i.e.,
such
as
monoids,
absolute
Galois
groups,
or
cyclotomes
—
consists,
for
instance,
of
an
arrow
from
one
label
to
another,
as
was
[essentially]
the
case
in
the
discussion
of
the
combinatorial
model
of
(i).
Put
another
way,
the
signiﬁcance
of
the
F±
l
-symmetry
under
consideration
lies
precisely
in
the
observation
that
this
symmetry
serves
to
eliminate
this
unwanted
“a
priori”
possibility.
This
is
in
some
sense
the
central
principle
illustrated
by
the
combinatorial
model
of
(i).
Put
in
other
words,
this
“central
principle”
discussed
in
(i)
may
be
summarized,
in
the
situation
of
Corollary
3.5,
as
follows:
the
F±
l
-symmetry
under
consideration
allows
one
to
construct
(a)
symmetrizing
isomorphisms
[cf.
Corollary
3.5,
(i)]
in
a
fashion
that
is
compatible
with
maintaining
a
(b)
bijective
link
with
the
set
of
labels
LabCusp±
(ΠX
(MΘ
∗
))
—
which
is
necessary
in
order
to
construct
the
Gaussian
monoids
[i.e.,
which
involve
distinct
values
at
distinct
labels!]
in
Corollary
3.5,
(ii)
—
all
relative
to
(c)
a
single
basepoint
[i.e.,
which
gives
rise
to
the
single
topological
group
ΠX
(MΘ
∗
)
—
cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
2.6.2,
(i)]
—
which
is
necessary
in
order
to
establish
conjugate
synchronization.
(iii)
In
the
context
of
Corollary
3.5,
(i),
one
essential
aspect
of
the
F±
l
Θ
symmetry
under
consideration
is
that
this
symmetry
arises
from
a
ΔX
(M∗
)-outer
±
Θ
∼
action
of
ΔC
(MΘ
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
2.6.2,
(i)].
That
∗
)/ΔX
(M∗
)
→
Fl
is
to
say,
the
fact
that
this
action
may
be
formulated
entirely
in
terms
of
conjugation
by
elements
of
geometric
[i.e.,
“Δ”]
fundamental
groups
—
that
is
to
say,
as
opposed
to
arithmetic
[i.e.,
“Π”]
fundamental
groups
—
plays
a
crucial
role
in
establishing
the
conjugate
synchronization
of
the
various
copies
of
“Gv
(MΘ
∗
)”
Θ
[and
objects
constructed
from
“Gv
(M∗
)”]
under
consideration
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],
Remark
6.12.6,
(ii)].
(iv)
If
one
thinks
of
the
F±
l
-symmetries
that
appear
in
the
conjugate
synchronization
of
Corollary
3.5,
(i),
as
“connecting”
the
various
copies
of
objects
at
distinct
evaluation
points,
then
it
is
perhaps
natural
to
regard
the
“conjugate
synchronization
via
symmetry”
of
Corollary
3.5,
(i),
as
a
sort
of
nonarchimedean
version
of
the
“conjugate
synchronization
via
connectedness”
discussed
in
Remark
2.6.1,
(i),
which
may
be
thought
of
as
being
based
on

In
§4
below,
we
shall
generalize
the
ideas
discussed
in
the
present
Remark
3.5.2
concerning
conjugate
synchronization
in
the
case
of
v
∈
Vbad
to
the

portion,
as
well
as
to
the
portion
at

∈

of
a

-Hodge
theater
[cf.
the
discussions
of
Remark
2.6.2,
(i);
Remark
3.8.2
below].
Remark
3.5.3.
The
delicacy
and
subtlety
of
the
theory
surrounding
Corollary
3.5,
(i),
may
be
thought
of
as
a
consequence
of
the
requirement
of
simultaneously
satisfying
the
conditions
(a),
(b),
(c)
discussed
in
Remark
3.5.2,
(ii).
On
the
other
hand,
if
one
is
willing
to
eliminate
condition
(c)
from
one’s
arguments,
then
one
may
obtain
symmetrizing
isomorphisms
by
simply
applying
the
functors
of
[IUTchI],
Proposition
6.8,
(i),
(ii),
(iii);
[IUTchI],
Proposition
6.9,
(i),
(ii)
—
i.e.,
by
passing
to
D-Θell
-bridges
or
[holomorphic
or
mono-analytic]
capsules
or
processions.
Here,
we
observe
that
this
“multi-basepoint”
approach
to
constructing
symmetrizing
isomorphisms
is
compatible
with
the
single
basepoint
F±
l
-symmetric
approach
of
Corollary
3.5,
(i),
relative
to
the
evident
“forgetful
functors”.
We
leave
the
routine
details
to
the
reader.

of

are
summarized,
at
a
more
conceptual
level,
in

—
that
is
to
say,
if
one
thinks
of
the

“MΘ

involved
as
arising
group-theoretically
[i.e.,
from
étale-like

which
is,
of
course,
always
the
case
up
to

—
cf.
the
situation
discussed
in

then
these
portions
correspond,
respectively,
to
the

“=⇒”,
“⇓”,

Here,
we
note
that
the
ﬁnal
operation
of

[i.e.,
“⇐=”]
may
be
thought
of
as
the
operation
of
forgetting
the
group-theoretic
—
i.e.,
“anabelian”
—
construction
of
the
Gaussian
monoids,
so
as
to
obtain
“abstract
monoids
stripped
of
any
information
concerning
the

—
which
we
refer

On

as
a

of

—
cf.
the
discussion
of
[FrdI],
Introduction;
[IUTchI],
Corollaries
3.8,
3.9.
In
this
context,
it
is
useful
to
recall
that
the
comparison
isomorphism
of
the
“classical”
scheme-theoretic
version
of
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
[cf.
[HASurI],
Theorem
A]
is
obtained
precisely
by
evaluating
theta
functions
and
their
derivatives
at
certain
torsion
points
of
an
elliptic
curve.
(ii)
The
existence
of
both
“Frobenius-like”
and
“étale-like”
structures
in
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers,
together
with
the
somewhat
complicated
theory
of
comparison
isomorphisms
as
discussed
above
in
(i),
prompts
the
following
question:
What
are
the
various
merits
and
demerits
of
“Frobenius-like”
and
“étalelike”
structures
that
require
one
to
avail
oneself
of
both
types
of
structure
in
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers
[cf.
Fig.
3.2
below]?
On
the
one
hand,
unlike
Frobenius-like
structures,
étale-like
structures
—
in
the
form
of
étale
or
tempered
fundamental
groups
[such
as
Galois
groups]
—
have
the
crucial
advantage
of
being
functorial
or
invariant
with
respect
to
various
nonring/scheme-theoretic
ﬁlters
between
distinct
ring/scheme
theories.
In
the
context
of
the
present
series
of
papers,
the
main
examples
of
this
phenomenon
consist
of
the
Θ-link
[cf.,
e.g.,
[IUTchI],
Corollary
3.7]
and
the
log-wall
[cf.
[AbsTopIII],
§I1,
§I4;
this
theory
will
be
incorporated
into
the
present
series
of
papers
in
[IUTchIII]].
Another
important
characteristic
of
the
étale-like
structures
constituted
by
étale
or
tempered
fundamental
group
is
their
“remarkable
rigidity”
—
a
property
that
is
exhibited
explicitly
[cf.,
e.g.,
the
theory
of
[EtTh];
[AbsTopIII]]
by
various
anabelian
algorithms
that
may
be
applied
to
construct,
in
a
“purely
group-theoretic
fashion”,
various
structures
motivated
by
conventional
scheme
theory.
By
contrast,
the
Frobenius-like
structures
constituted
by
various
abstract
monoids
—
which
typically
give
rise
to
various
Frobenioids
—
satisfy
the
crucial
property
of
not
being
subject
to
such
rigidifying
anabelian
algorithms
that
relate
various
étale-like
structures
to
conventional
scheme
theory.
It
is
precisely
this
property
of
such
abstract
monoids
that
allows
one
to
use
these
abstract
monoids
to
construct
such
non-scheme-theoretic
ﬁlters
as
the
Θ-link
[cf.
[IUTchI],
Corollary
3.7]
or
the
log-wall
of
the
theory
of
[AbsTopIII].
Here,
it
is
interesting
to
observe
that
these
merits/demerits
of
étale-like
and
Frobenius-like
structures
play
somewhat
complementary
roles
with
respect
to
binding/not
binding
the
structures
under
consideration
to
conventional
scheme
theory.
Finally,
we
note
that
Kummer
theory
serves
the
crucial
role
[cf.
the
discussion
of
(i)]
of
relating
[via
various
comparison
isomorphisms
—
cf.
(i)]
—
within
a
given
Hodge
theater
—
potentially
non-scheme-theoretic
Frobenius-like
structures
to
étale-like
structures
which
are
subject
to
anabelian
rigidiﬁcations
that
bind
them
to
conventional
scheme
theory.
(iii)
If
one
composes
the
correspondence
“q
v
→
Θv
”
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],
Remark
3.8.1,
(i)]
constituted
by
the
Θ-link
—
i.e.,
which
relates
the
“(n
+
1)-th
generation
q-parameter”
to
the
“n-th
generation
Θ-function”
—
with
the
composite
of
the
arrows
“=⇒”,
“⇓”,
and
“⇐=”
of
Fig.
3.1,
then
one
obtains

103

1≤j≤l
[cf.
Remark
2.5.1,
(i)].
In
fact,
in
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers,
it
is
ultimately
this
“modiﬁed
version
of
the
Θ-link”
—
i.e.,
which
takes
into
account
the
Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic
evaluation
theory
developed
so
far
in
§2
and
the
present
§3
—
that
will
be
of
interest
to
us.
The
theory
of
this
“modiﬁed
version
of
the
Θ-link”
will
constitute
one
of
the
main
topics
treated
in
§4
below.
Here,
we
observe
that
the
above
correspondence
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“abstract,
combinatorial
Frobenius
lifting”
—
i.e.,
as
a
sort
of
“homotopy”
between

[i.e.,
which
corresponds
to

[i.e.,
which
corresponds

Moreover,
we
recall
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
2.6.3]
that
the
collection
of
exponents
{j

In

is
of

to
recall
that

“Grothendieck

results”
in

[e.g.,
over
p-adic
local
ﬁelds
and
ﬁnite

i.e.,
which
may
be
thought
of
as

isomorphisms
between

—
are
obtained
precisely
by
combining
various
considerations

to
the
situation
of

with
the
“Galois
evaluation”
via
Kummer
theory
of

functions
or
diﬀerential
forms
at
various
rational
points
—
cf.
the
theory
of
[pGC];
[Cusp],
§2.
Remark
3.6.3.
Before
proceeding,
we
make
some
observations
concerning
basepoints
in
the
context
of
the
“non-ring/scheme-theoretic
ﬁlters”
discussed
in
Remark
3.6.2.
(i)
First,
let
us
recall
from
the
elementary
theory
of
étale
fundamental
groups
that
the
ﬁber
functor
associated
to
a
basepoint
is
deﬁned
by
considering
the
points
of
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
valued
in
some
separably
closed
ﬁeld
that
lie
over
a
ﬁxed
point
[valued
in
the
same
separably
closed
ﬁeld]
of
the
base
scheme
over
which
the
covering
is
given.
Thus,
for
instance,
when
this
base
scheme
is
the
spectrum
of
a
ﬁeld,
the
ﬁnite
set
of
points
associated
by
the
ﬁber
functor
to
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
is
obtained
by
considering
the
various
ring
homomorphisms
from
this
ﬁeld
into
some
separably
closed
ﬁeld.
In
particular,
it
follows
that
the
conventional
scheme-theoretic
deﬁnition
of
a
basepoint
[in
the
form
of
a
ﬁber
functor]
depends,
in
an
essential
fashion,
on
the
ring/scheme
structure
of
the
rings
or
schemes
under
consideration.
One
immediate
consequence
of
these
elementary
considerations
—
which
is
of
central
importance
in
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers
—
is
the
following
observation
concerning
the
“non-ring/scheme-theoretic
ﬁlters”
discussed
in
Remark
3.6.2,
which
relate
one
ring
to
another
in
a
fashion
that
is
incompatible
with
the
respective
ring
structures:
The
distinct
ring
structures
on
either
side
of
one
of
the
“non-ring/
scheme-theoretic
ﬁlters”
discussed
in
Remark
3.6.2
—
i.e.,
the
log-wall
of
[AbsTopIII]
and
the
Θ-link
of
[IUTchI],
Corollary
3.7
—
give
rise
to
distinct,
unrelated
basepoints
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[AbsTopIII],
Remark
3.7.7,
(i)].
In
some
sense,
the
above
discussion
may
be
thought
of
as
an
“expanded,
leisurely
version”
of
an
observation
made
at
the
beginning
of
the
discussion
of
[AbsTopIII],
Remark
3.7.7,
(i).
(ii)
The
observations
of
(i)
also
apply
to
the
“N
-th
power
morphisms”
[where
N
>
1]
—
i.e.,
“morphisms
of
Frobenius
type”
—
that
appear
in
the
theory
of
Frobenioids
[cf.
[FrdI],
[FrdII],
[EtTh]].
That
is
to
say,
in
the
context
of
the
tempered
Frobenioids
that
appear
in
the
theory
of
[EtTh],
§5,
such
“morphisms
of
Frobenius
type”
[i.e.,
“N
-th
power
morphisms”
regarded
as
morphisms
contained
in
the
underlying
categories
associated
to
these
tempered
Frobenioids]
induce
“N
-th
power
morphisms”
between
various
monoids
[arising
from
the
Frobenioid
structure]

.
In
particular,
isomorphic
to
OK
v
these
N
-th
power
morphisms
of
monoids
fail
[since
N
>
1]
to
preserve
the
ring
structure
of
Kv
,
hence
give
rise
to
distinct,
unrelated
basepoints
on
the
domain
and
codomain
objects
of
the
original
“morphism
of
Frobenius
type”
[cf.
the
discussion
of
(i)].
INTER-UNIVERSAL
TEICHMÜLLER

105
On
the
other
hand,
let
us
observe
that
unlike
the
situations
considered
in
the
discussion
of
(i),
the
considerations
of
the
present
discussion
involving
N
-th
power
morphisms
take
place
in
a
fashion
that
is
compatible
with
the
projection
functor
to
the
base
category
of
the
Frobenioid.
One
important
consequence
of
this
last
observation
is
that
unlike
the
situations
discussed
in
(i)
involving
the
log-wall
and
the
Θ-link
in
which
one
must
consider
arbitrary
isomorphisms
of
topological
groups
between
the
étale
[or
tempered]
fundamental
groups
that
arise
in
the
domain
and
the
codomain
of
the
operation
under
consideration,
in
the
situation
of
the
present
discussion
of
N
-th
power
morphisms,
the
“distinct,
unrelated
basepoints”
that
arise
only
give
rise
to
inner
automorphisms
of
the
topological
group
determined
by
[i.e.,
roughly
speaking,
the
“fundamental
group”
of]
the
base
category.
This
phenomenon
may
be
thought
of
as
a
reﬂection
of
the
fact
that
the
application
of
an
N
-th
power
morphism
is
somewhat
“milder”
than
the
log-wall
or
Θ-link
considered
in
(i)
in
that
it
only
involves
an
operation
—
i.e.,
raising
to
the
N
-th
power
—
that
is
“algebraic”,
in
the
sense
that
it
is
deﬁned
with
respect
to
the
ring
structure
of
the
ring
[e.g.,
Kv
]
involved.
This
somewhat
“milder
nature”
of
an
N
-th
power
morphism
allows
one
to
consider
N
-th
power
morphisms
within
a
single
category
[namely,
the
tempered
Frobenioid
under
consideration]
which
can
be
deﬁned
in
terms
of
[formal]
ﬂat
OKv
-schemes
[cf.
the
point
of
view
of
[EtTh],
§1].
By
contrast,
the
operation
inherent
in
the
log-wall
or
Θ-link
considered
in
(i)
is
much
more
drastic
and
arithmetic
[i.e.,
“non-algebraic”]
in
nature,
and
it
is
diﬃcult
to
see
how
to
ﬁt
such
an
operation
into
a
single
category
that
somehow
“extends”
the
tempered
Frobenioid
under
consideration
in
a
fashion
that
“lies
over”
the
same
base
category
as
the
tempered
Frobenioid
—
cf.,
e.g.,
Remark
1.11.2,
(ii),
in
the
case
of
the
Θ-link;
the
discussion
of
[AbsTopIII],
Remark
3.7.7,
in
the
case
of
the
log-wall.
Put
another
way,
the
highly
nontrivial
study
of
the
mathematical
structures
“generated
by
the
log-wall
and
Θ-link”
is,
in
some
sense,
one
of
the
main
themes
of
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers
—
cf.,
especially,
the
theory
of
[IUTchIII]!
Remark
3.6.4.
Since
the
theory
of
mono-theta
environments
developed
in
[EtTh]
plays
a
fundamental
role
in
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
—
cf.,
e.g.,
Corollaries
1.12,
2.8,
3.5,
3.6
—
it
is
of
interest
to
pause
to
review
the
relationship
of
the
theory
of
[EtTh]
to
the
theory
developed
so
far
in
the
present
paper.
(i)
The
various
remarks
following
[EtTh],
Corollary
5.12,
discuss
the
signiﬁcance
of
the
various
rigidity
properties
of
a
mono-theta
environment
that
are
veriﬁed
in
[EtTh].
The
logical
starting
point
of
this
discussion
is
the
situation
considered
in
[EtTh],
Remarks
5.12.1,
5.12.2,
consisting
of
an
abstract
category
which
is
only
known
up
to
isomorphism
[i.e.,
up
to
an
indeterminate
equivalence
of
categories],
and
in
which
each
of
the
objects
is
only
known
up
to
isomorphism.
The
main
example
of
such
a
category,
in
the
context
of
the
theory
of
[EtTh],
is
a
tempered
Frobenioid
of
the
sort
considered
in
Propositions
3.3,
3.4;
Corollary
3.6.
The
situation
of
[EtTh],
Remarks
5.12.1,
5.12.2,
in
which
each
of
the
objects
in
the
category
106
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
is
only
known
up
to
isomorphism,
contrasts
sharply
with
the
notion
of
a
system,
or
tower,
of
[speciﬁc!]
coverings
—
e.g.,
of
the
sort
that
appears
in
Kummer
theory,
in
which
the
coverings
are
related
by
[speciﬁc!]
N
-th
power
morphisms.
Indeed,
the
various
rigidity
properties
veriﬁed
in
[EtTh]
are
of
interest
precisely
because
they
yield
eﬀective
reconstruction
algorithms
for
reconstructing
the
various
structures
of
interest
in
a
fashion
that
is
invariant
with
respect
to
the
indeterminacies
that
arise
from
a
situation
in
which
each
of
the
objects
in
the
category
is
only
known
up
to
isomorphism.
This
prompts
the
following
question:
What
is
the
fundamental
reason,
in
the
context
of
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers,
that
one
must
work
under
the
assumption
that
each
of
the
objects
in
the
category
is
only
known
up
to
isomorphism,
thus
requiring
one
to
avail
oneself
of
the
rigidity
theory
of
[EtTh]?
To
understand
the
answer
to
this
question,
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
Kummer
towers
involving
[speciﬁc!]
N
-th
power
morphisms
are
constructed
by
using
the
multiplicative
structure
of
the
“rational
functions”
[such
as
the
pv
-adic
local
ﬁeld
Kv
]
under
consideration.
That
is
to
say,
the
N
-th
power
morphisms
are
compatible
with
the
multiplicative
structure,
but
not
the
additive
structure
of
such
rational
functions.
On
the
other
hand,
ultimately,
when,
in
[IUTchIII],
we
consider
the
theory
of
the
log-wall
[cf.
[AbsTopIII]],
it
will
be
of
crucial
importance
to
consider,
within
each
Hodge
theater,
the
ring
structure
[i.e.,
both
the
multiplicative
and
additive
structures]
of
the
ﬁelds
Kv
.
That
is
to
say,
without
the
ring
structure
on
Kv
,
one
cannot
even
deﬁne
the
pv
adic
logarithm!
Put
another
way,
the
N
-th
power
morphisms
that
appear
in
a
Kummer
tower
may
be
thought
of
as
“Frobenius
morphisms
of
a
sort”
that
relate
distinct
ring
structures
—
i.e.,
since
the
N
-th
power
morphism
fails
to
be
compatible
with
addition!
In
particular,
the
distinct
ring
structures
that
exist
in
the
domain
and
codomain
of
such
a
“Frobenius
morphism”
necessarily
give
rise
to
distinct,
unrelated
basepoints
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
3.6.3,
(ii)]
—
i.e.,
at
an
abstract
category-theoretic
level,
to
objects
which
are
only
known
up
to
isomorphism!
This
is
what
requires
one
to
contend
with
the
indeterminacies
discussed
in
[EtTh],
Remarks
5.12.1,
5.12.2.
(ii)
The
theory
of
[EtTh]
may
be
summarized
as
asserting
that
one
may
reconstruct
various
structures
of
interest
from
a
mono-theta
environment
without
sacriﬁcing
certain
fundamental
rigidity
properties,
even
in
a
situation
subject
to
certain
indeterminacies
[cf.
(i)].
Moreover,
mono-theta
environments
serve
as
a
sort
of
bridge
[cf.
[EtTh],
Remark
5.10.1]
between
tempered
Frobenioids
—
i.e.,
“Frobenius-like
structures”
[cf.
Remark
3.6.2]
—
as
in
Propositions
3.3,
3.4;
Corollary
3.6,
on
the
one
hand,
and
tempered
fundamental
groups
[cf.
Proposition
3.4]
—
i.e.,
“étale-like
structures
[cf.
Remark
3.6.2]
—
on
the
other.
(iii)
One
central
feature
of
the
theory
of
[EtTh]
is
an
explanation
of
the
special
role
played
by
the
ﬁrst
power
of
the
[reciprocal
of
the
l-th
root
of
the]
theta
function,
a
role
which
is
reﬂected
in
the
theory
of
cyclotomic
rigidity
developed
INTER-UNIVERSAL
TEICHMÜLLER
THEORY
II
107
in
[EtTh]
[cf.
[EtTh],
Introduction].
Note
that
the
operation
of
Galois
evaluation
is
necessarily
linear
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
1.12.4].
This
linearity
may
be
seen
in
the
linearity
of
the
arrows
“=⇒”,
“⇓”,
and
“⇐=”
of
Fig.
3.1.
In
particular,
these
arrows
are
compatible
with
the
ring
structure
on
the
constants
[i.e.,
“Kv
”]
—
a
property
that
will
be
of
crucial
importance
when,
in
[IUTchIII],
we
consider
the
theory
of
the
log-wall
[cf.
the
discussion
of
(i)
above].
Moreover,
this
linearity
property
of
the
operation
of
Galois
evaluation
implies
that
the
ﬁrst
power
of
the
theta
values
of
the
[reciprocal
of
the
l-th
root
of
the]
theta
function
“inherits”,
so
to
speak,
the
special
role
played
by
the
ﬁrst
power
of
the
[reciprocal
of
the
l-th
root
of
the]
theta
function.
This
observation
is
interesting
in
light
of
the
discussions
of
Remarks
2.6.3;
3.6.2,
(iii).
(iv)
In
the
context
of
(iii),
we
note
that
the
various
theta
monoids
discussed
in
Propositions
3.1,
3.3,
as
well
as
the
various
Gaussian
monoids
discussed
in
Corollaries
3.5,
3.6,
involve
arbitrary
powers/roots
of
the
[reciprocal
of
the
l-th
root
of
the]
theta
function.
Nevertheless,
it
is
important
to
remember
that
in
order
to
apply
the
Θ-link
—
which
requires
one
to
work
with
“Frobenius-like
structures”
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
3.6.2,
(ii)]
—
it
is
necessary
to
consider
the
operation
of
Galois
evaluation
summarized
in
Fig.
3.1
applied
to
the
ﬁrst
power
of
the
[reciprocal
of
the
l-th
root
of
the]
Frobenioid-theoretic
theta
function
in
order
to
avail
oneself
of
the
cyclotomic
rigidity
furnished
by
the
delicate
bridge
constituted
by
the
mono-theta
environment
—
cf.
(ii)
above.
That
is
to
say,
the
“narrow
bridge”
aﬀorded
by
the
mono-theta
environment
between
the
worlds
of
“Frobenius-like”
and
“étale-like”
structures
may
only
be
crossed
by
the
ﬁrst
power
of
the
[reciprocal
of
the
l-th
root
of
the]
theta
function
and
its
theta
values.
Put
another
way,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
étale-like
portion
[i.e.,
“group-theoretic”
portion]
of
the
operation
of
Galois
evaluation
summarized
in
Fig.
3.1,
the
N
-th
power
of
the
[reciprocal
of
the
l-th
root
of
the]
Frobenioid-theoretic
theta
function,
for
N
>
1,
is
only
deﬁned
as
the
N
-th
power
“(−)N
”
of
the
ﬁrst
power
of
the
[reciprocal
of
the
l-th
root
of
the]
Frobenioidtheoretic
theta
function.
That
is
to
say,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
étale-like
portion
of
the
operation
of
Galois
evaluation
summarized
in
Fig.
3.1,
the
N
-th
power
of
the
[reciprocal
of
the
l-th
root
of
the]
Frobenioid-theoretic
theta
function,
for
N
>
1
—
hence,
in
particular,
the
Θ-link
—
may
only
be
calculated
by
forming
the
N
-th
power
“(−)N
”
of
the
ﬁrst
power
of
the
[reciprocal
of
the
l-th
root
of
the]
Frobenioidtheoretic
theta
function.
(v)
The
necessity
of
working
with
“Frobenius-like
structures”
[cf.
the
discussion
of
(iv)]
may
also
be
thought
of
as
the
necessity
of
working
with
the
various
postanabelian
monoids
arising
from
the
group-theoretic
“anabelian”
algorithms
that
appear
in
the
operation
of
Galois
evaluation
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
3.6.2,
108
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
(i)].
In
the
context
of
this
observation,
it
is
useful
to
recall
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
theory
of
§1,
the
“narrow
bridge”
furnished
by
[for
instance,
the
cyclotomic
rigidity
of]
a
mono-theta
environment
satisﬁes
the
crucial
property
of
multiradiality
[cf.
Corollaries
1.10,
1.12]
—
i.e.,
of
being
“horizontal”
with
respect
to
the
“connection
structure”
determined
by
the
formulation
of
this
multiradiality
[cf.
the
point
of
view
discussed
in
Remarks
1.7.1,
1.9.2].
Put
another
way,
to
work
with
powers
other
than
the
ﬁrst
power
of
the
[reciprocal
of
the
l-th
root
of
the]
theta
function
or
its
theta
values
gives
rise
to
structures
which
are
“not
horizontal”
with
respect
to
this
“connection
structure”.
This
point
of
view
is
consistent
with
the
point
of
view
of
Remark
3.6.5,
(iii),
below.
A
similar
observation
concerning
multiradiality
will
also
apply
to
the
“multiradial
versions
of
the
Gaussian
monoids”
that
will
be
constructed
in
[IUTchIII]
[cf.
Remark
3.7.1
below].
Remark
3.6.5.
In
light
of
the
central
role
played
by
mono-theta-theoretic
cyclotomic
rigidity
in
the
discussion
of
Remark
3.6.4,
we
pause
to
make
some
observations
—
of
a
somewhat
more
philosophical
nature
—
concerning
this
topic.
(i)
First
of
all,
we
observe
that
a
cyclotome
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“skeleton
of
the
arithmetic
holomorphic
structure”
under
consideration
—
cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
1.11.6.
Indeed,
this
point
of
view
may
be
thought
of
as
being
motivated
by
the
situation
at
archimedean
primes,
where
the
circle
“S1
”
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“representative
skeleton
of
C×
”.
This
point
of
view
will
play
a
central
role
in
the
remainder
of
the
discussion
of
the
present
Remark
3.6.5,
as
well
as
in
the
discussion
of
Remark
3.8.3
below.
(ii)
In
the
theory
of
[EtTh],
(a)
the
commutator
structure
[−,
−]
of
the
theta
group
plays
a
central
role
in
the
theory
of
mono-theta-theoretic
cyclotomic
rigidity
—
cf.
[EtTh],
Introduction;
[EtTh],
Remark
2.19.2.
On
the
other
hand,
in
the
classical
theory
of
algebraic
theta
functions
(b)
the
commutator
structure
[−,
−]
of
the
theta
group
plays
a
central
role
in
the
theory
via
the
observation
that
this
commutator
structure
implies
the
irreducibility
of
certain
representations
of
the
theta
group.
At
ﬁrst
glance,
these
two
applications
(a),
(b)
of
the
commutator
structure
[−,
−]
of
the
theta
group
may
appear
to
be
unrelated.
In
fact,
however,
they
may
both
be
understood
as
examples
of
the
following
phenomenon:
(c)
the
commutator
structure
[−,
−]
of
the
theta
group
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
concrete
embodiment
of
the
“coherence
of
holomorphic
structures”.
INTER-UNIVERSAL
TEICHMÜLLER
THEORY

109
Indeed,
as
discussed
in
[EtTh],
Introduction,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
schemetheoretic
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
of
[HASurI],
[HASurII],
the
irreducible
representations
that
appear
in
the
classical
theory
of
algebraic
theta
functions
as
submodules
of
the
module
of
all
set-theoretic
functions
on
the
l-torsion
points
of
an
elliptic
curve
[cf.
(b)]
may
be
thought
of,
for
instance,
when
l
is
large,
as
discrete
analogues
of
the
submodule
of
“holomorphic
functions”
within
the
module
of
all
real
analytic
functions.
On
the
other
hand,
if
one
thinks
of
cyclotomes
as
“skeleta
of
arithmetic
holomorphic
structures”
[cf.
(i)],
then
the
theory
of
conjugate
synchronization
[cf.
Remark
3.5.2,
as
well
as
Remark
3.8.3
below]
—
applied,
for
instance,
in
the
case
of
cyclotomes
—
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“discretely
parametrized”
[in
the
sense
that
it
is
indexed
by
torsion
points]
coherence
of
arithmetic
holomorphic
structures,
which
is
obtained
by
working
with
the
connected
subgraph
Γ
X
⊆
ΓX
[cf.
Remark
2.6.1,
(i)].
In
this
context,
mono-theta-theoretic
cyclotomic
rigidity
[cf.
(a)]
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“continuously
parametrized
version”
[i.e.,
supported
on
Ÿ
v
,
as
opposed
to
a
ﬁnite
set
of
torsion
points]
of
this
coherence
of
arithmetic
holomorphic
structures.
Finally,
we
recall
that
the
interaction
—
i.e.,
via
restriction
operations
—
between
these
“discrete”
and
“continuous”
versions
of
the
“coherence
of
arithmetic
holomorphic
structures”
plays
a
central
role
in
the
theory
of
Galois
evaluation
given
in
Corollaries
2.8,
(i);
3.5,
(ii);
3.6,
(ii).
(iii)
If
one
thinks
of
cyclotomes
at
localizations
[say,
at
v
∈
Vbad
]
of
a
number
ﬁeld
[i.e.,
K]
as
local
skeleta
of
the
arithmetic
holomorphic
structure
[cf.
(i)],
then
the
mono-theta-theoretic
cyclotomic
rigidity
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“local
uniformization”
of
a
number
ﬁeld
[cf.
the
exterior
cyclotome
of
a
mono-theta
environment
that
arises
from
a
tempered
Frobenioid,
as
in
Proposition
1.3,
(i)]
via
a
local
portion
[cf.
the
interior
cyclotome
in
the
situation
of
Proposition
1.3,
(i)]
of
the
geometric
tempered
fundamental
group
Δv
associated
to
a
certain
covering
of
the
once-punctured
elliptic
curve
XF
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.3,
(i);
[IUTchI],
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(e)].
Since
the
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphism
arising
from
mono-theta-theoretic
cyclotomic
rigidity
may
be
thought
of
as
the
“cyclotomic
portion”
of
the
theta
function,
mono-theta-theoretic
cyclotomic
rigidity
may
be
interpreted
as
the
statement
that
the
theta
function
constructed
from
a
mono-theta
environment
is
free
of
any
Z×
power
indeterminacies.
Moreover,
if
one
takes
this
point
of
view,
then
constant
multiple
rigidity
may
be
thought
of
as
the
statement
that
the
above
“local
uniformization”
is
suﬃciently
rigid
as
to
be
free
of
any
constant
multiple
indeterminacies.
Here,
it
is
useful
to
recall
that
the
once-punctured
elliptic
curve
XF
on
the
number
ﬁeld
F
that
occurs
in
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers
may
be
thought
of
as
being
analogous
to
the
nilpotent
ordinary
indigenous
bundles
on
a
hyperbolic
curve
in
positive
characteristic
in
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[AbsTopIII],
§I5].
That
it
to
say,
from
this
point
of
view,
the
“local
uniformizations”
of
the
above
discussion
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
the
local
uniformizations
via
canonical
coordinates
of
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
[cf.,
e.g.,
[pTeich],
§0.9],
which
are
also
“suﬃciently
rigid”
as
to
be
free
of
any
Z×
-power
or
constant
multiple
indeterminacies.
Here,
mono-theta-theoretic
cyclotomic
rigidity
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
the
Kodaira-Spencer
isomorphism
110
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
[associated
to
the
Hodge
section
of
the
canonical
indigenous
bundle],
which,
in
some
sense,
may
be
thought
of
as
the
“skeleton”
of
the
local
uniformizations
of
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory.
Also,
it
is
useful
to
recall
in
this
context
that
the
canonical
coordinates
of
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
are
constructed
by
considering
invariants
with
respect
to
certain
canonical
Frobenius
liftings.
Put
another
way,
the
technique
of
considering
Frobenius-invariants
allows
one
to
pass,
in
a
canonical
way,
from
objects
deﬁned
modulo
p
to
objects
deﬁned
modulo
higher
powers
of
p.
Since
the
various
Θ-links
of
the
Frobenius-picture
may
be
regarded
as
corresponding
to
the
various
transitions
from
“mod
pn
to
mod
pn+1
”
[where
n
∈
N]
in
the
theory
of
Witt
vectors
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],
§I4;
[IUTchIII],
Remark
1.4.1,
(iii)],
it
is
natural
to
regard,
in
the
context
of
the
canonical
splittings
furnished
by
the
étale-picture
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],
§I1],
the
multiradiality
of
the
formulation
of
mono-theta-theoretic
cyclotomic
rigidity
and
constant
multiple
rigidity
given
in
Corollary
1.12
as
corresponding
to
the
Frobenius-invariant
nature
of
the
canonical
coordinates
of
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory.
Finally,
in
this
context,
we
observe
that
it
is
perhaps
natural
to
think
of
the
discrete
rigidity
of
the
theory
of
[EtTh]
as
corresponding
to
the
fact
that
the
canonical
coordinates
of
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory,
which
a
priori
may
only
be
constructed
as
PD-formal
power
series,
may
in
fact
be
constructed
as
power
series
in
the
usual
sense,
i.e.,
elements
of
the
completion
O
of
the
local
ring
at
the
point
under
consideration.
Indeed,
the
discrete
rigidity
of
[EtTh]
implies
that
one
may
restrict
oneself
to
working
with
the
usual
theta
function,
canonical
multiplicative
coordinates
[i.e.,
“U
”],
and
q-parameters
on
appropriate
tempered
coverings
of
the
Tate
curve,
all
of
which,
like
the
power
series
arising
from
canonical
parameters
in
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory,
give
rise
to
“functions
on
suitable
formal
schemes”
in
the
sense
of
classical
scheme
theory.
By
contrast,
if
this
discrete
rigidity
were
to
fail,
then
one
would
be
obliged
to
work
in
an
“a
priori
proﬁnite”
framework
that
involves,
for
instance,
Z-powers
of
“U
”
and
“q”
[cf.
[EtTh],
Remarks
1.6.4,
2.19.4].
Such
Z-powers
appear
naturally
in
the
Z-modules
that
arise
[e.g.,
as
cohomology
modules]
in
the
Kummer
theory
of
the
theta
function
and
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
PD-formal
power
series
in
the
sense
that
arbitrary
O-powers
of
canonical
parameters
[say,
for
simplicity,
at
non-cuspidal
ordinary
points
of
a
canonical
curve],
which
arise
naturally
when
one
considers
such
parameters
additively
[cf.
the
discussion
of
“canonical
aﬃne
coordinates”
in
[pOrd],
Chapter
III],
cannot
be
deﬁned
if
one
restricts
oneself
to
working
with
conventional
power
series
—
i.e.,
such
O-powers
may
only
be
deﬁned
if
one
allows
oneself
to
work
with
PD-formal
power
series.

one

Remark
3.8.1.
In
the
present
series
of
papers,
we
follow
the
convention
[cf.
[IUTchI],
§0]
that
an
“isomorphism
of
categories”
is
to
be
understood
as
an
isomorphism
class
of
equivalences
of
categories.
On
the
other
hand,
in
the
context
of
the
discussion
of
Frobenioids
in
Deﬁnition
3.8,
in
order
to
obtain
a
precise
“Frobenioidtheoretic
translation”
of
the
results
obtained
so
far
[in
the
language
of
monoids]
that
involve
the
phenomenon
of
conjugate
synchronization
[cf.
Remark
3.5.2;
the
discussion
of
Remark
3.8.3
below],
one
is
obliged
to
consider
the
various
Frobenioids
indexed
by
a
subscript
“|t|
∈
|Fl
|”
as
being
determined
up
to
an
isomorphism
of
the
identity
functor
—
i.e.,
corresponding
to
an
“inner
automorphism”
in
the
context
of
Corollaries
3.5,
(i);
3.6,
(i)
—
which
is
independent
of
|t|
∈
|Fl
|.
In
particular,
when
there
is
a
danger
of
confusion,
perhaps
the
simplest
approach
is
to
resort
to
the
original
“monoid-theoretic
formulations”
of
Corollaries

3.6.

Remark
3.8.2.
At
this
point,
it
is
of
interest
to
pause
to
discuss
the
relationship
between
the
theory
of
the
present
§3
and
the
theories
of
F±
l

[cf.

[IUTchI],
§6]
and
Fl

[cf.
[IUTchI],
§4,

developed
in
[IUTchI].
(i)
First
of
all,
the
construction
algorithms
for
the
Gaussian
monoids
discussed
in
Corollaries
3.5,

3.6,

as
well
as
for
the
closely

splittings
discussed
in
Corollaries
3.5,

3.6,

involve
restriction
to
the

indexed
[via
a

by
proﬁnite

of

[cf.

which
are
subject
to
a
certain
±
F±
l

[cf.
Corollary
2.4,
(iii)].
This
Fl

may
be
thought
of
as
the
restriction,
to
the
portion
labeled
by
the

v

under

of
the

Proposition
6.8,

associated
to
a
±ell
D-Θ
-Hodge
theater
[cf.
Remark
2.6.2,
(i)].
From
the
point
of
view
of
the
issue
of
“which
portion
of
the
original
once-punctured
elliptic
curve
over
a
number
ﬁeld
XF
[cf.
[IUTchI],
Deﬁnition

is
involved”,
this
theory
of
split
Gaussian
monoids
revolves
around
various
labeled
[i.e.,
by
elements
of
copies
of
Fl
or
|Fl

copies
of
the
local
Frobenioids
at

of
the
mono-analyticizations
of
the
F-prime-strips
that
appear
in
a
D-Θ±ell
-Hodge

—
cf.
the
various
natural
embeddings
discussed
in
Deﬁnition
3.8,
(iii)
—
i.e.,
more
concretely,
copies
of
the
portion
of
the
pair
“Gv
(Πv
)

OF
”
determined
by
a
certain
submonoid
of
OF
.
Finally,
we
recall
v
v
that
after
one
executes
these
construction
algorithms
for
split
Gaussian
monoids
and
observes
the
F±
l

discussed
above,
one
may
then
form
holomorphic
or
mono-analytic
processions,
indexed
by
subsets
of
|Fl
|,
as
discussed
in
[IUTchI],
Proposition
6.9,
(i),
(ii).
(ii)
On
the
other
hand,
by
applying
the
algorithm
of
[IUTchI],
Proposition
6.7,
one
may
pass
to
the
local
portion
at
v
∈
Vbad
of
a
D-ΘNF-Hodge
theater.
At
the
level
of
labels,
this
amounts
to
removing
the
label
0

and
identifying
this
label
with
the
complement
of
0
in
|Fl
|,
i.e.,
with
F

—
cf.
the
assignment
“

of
D-prime-strips
discussed
in
[IUTchI],
Proposition
6.7.
At

at

[i.e.,
copies
of
the

“Πv

corresponding

this

may
be
thought

Proposition
4.9,

—
cf.
the
discussion
of
the

in
the
situation
of
(i).
As
we
shall
see
in
§4
below,
at
least
at
the
level
of
value
groups,
this
newly
obtained
situation
involving
F

is
bad
to
the
valuations
well-suited
to
relating
the
theory
of
the
present
§3
at
v

V
∈
Vgood
,
as
well
as
to
the
global
theory
of
[IUTchI],
§5.
This
global
theory
satisﬁes
the
crucial
property
that
it
allows
one
to
relate

Finally,
starting
from
this
newly

situation,
one
may
proceed
to
form
holomorphic

mono-analytic
processions,
indexed
by
subsets
of
F

as
discussed

Proposition

Remark
3.8.3.
One
central
theme
of
the
theory
of
the
present
§3
is
the
application
of
the
phenomenon
of
conjugate
synchronization
[cf.
Remark
3.5.2],
which
plays
a
fundamental
role
in
the
theory
of
the
group-theoretic
version
of
Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic
evaluation
of
the
theta
function
developed
in
§2.
Thus,
it
is
of
interest
to
pause
to
discuss
precisely
what
was
gained
in
the
present
§3
by
applying
the
conjugate
synchronization
obtained
in
§2.
(i)
We
begin
our
discussion
by
reviewing
the
following
direct
technical
consequences
of
the
conjugate
synchronization
discussed
in
Remark

[cf.
also
Fig.
3.1;
the
discussion
of
Remark
3.6.2,
(i)].
Here,
we
observe
that
(b)
and
(c)
may
be
thought
of
as
formal
consequences
of
(a),
while
(d)
may
be
thought
of
as
an
alternate
formulation
of
the
portion
of
(a)
concerning
the
units
in
the
case
of
|t|

F
l
.
Moreover,
as
discussed
in
Remark
3.6.2,
(iii),
ultimately,
in
the
present
series
of
papers,
we
shall
be
interested
in
composing
the
Θ-link
with
the
composite
of
the
arrows
“=⇒”,
“⇓”,
and
“⇐=”
of
Fig.
3.1
—
i.e.,
with
the
isomorphism
of
monoids
that
appears
in
the
display
of
(d).
Indeed,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers,
our
main
application
[cf.
§4
below]
of
the
conjugate
synchronization
discussed
in
Remark
3.5.2
will
consist
precisely
of
the
isomorphism
of
units
of
(d),
in
the
context
of
composition
with
the
Θ-link
—
cf.
the
“coricity
of
O×
”
given
in
[IUTchI],
Corollary
3.7,
(iii).
118
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
Finally,
in
this
context,
we
recall
that
the
isomorphisms
of
monoids
that
appear
in
the
Θ-link
or
in
the
third
display
of
Corollary
3.6,
(ii),
only
make
sense
if
one
works
with
post-anabelian
abstract
monoids/Frobenioids
—
i.e.,
with
“Frobenius-like”
structures
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
3.6.2,
(i),
(ii)].
(ii)
In
[IUTchIII],
it
will
be
of
central
importance
to
consider
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
in
the
context
of
the
log-wall
[i.e.,
the
situation
considered
in
[AbsTopIII]].
In
the
context
of
the
log-wall,
it
will
be
of
fundamental
importance
to
construct
versions
of
the
various
Frobenioid-theoretic
theta
and
Gaussian
monoids
that
appeared
in
the
discussion
at
the
end
of
(i)
that
are
capable
of
“penetrating
the
log-wall”
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[AbsTopIII],
§I4]
—
i.e.,
to
construct
étale-like
versions
of
these
Frobenioid-theoretic
theta
and
Gaussian
monoids,
by
availing
oneself
of
the
right-hand
portion
of
Fig.
3.1.
Now
to
pass
from
these
Frobenioid-theoretic
monoids
to
their
étale-like
counterparts,
one
must
apply
Kummer
theory
—
cf.
the
arrow
“=⇒”
of
Fig.
3.1.
Moreover,
in
order
to
apply
Kummer
theory,
one
must
avail
oneself
of
the
cyclotomes
contained
in
[i.e.,
the
torsion
subgroups
of]
the
various
groups
of
units
of
the
relevant
monoids.
It
is
at
this
point
that
it
is
necessary
to
apply,
in
the
fashion
discussed
in
(i),
the
conjugate
synchronization
discussed
in
Remark
3.5.2
in
an
essential
way.
That
is
to
say,
if
one
is
in
a
situation
in
which
one
cannot
avail
oneself
of
this
conjugate
synchronization,
then
it
follows
from
the
distinct,
unrelated
nature
of
the
basepoints
on
either
side
of
the
log-wall
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
3.6.3,
(i)]
that
one
may
only
construct
diagonal
embeddings
of
either
submonoids
of
Galoisinvariants
or
sets
of
Galois-orbits
of
the
various
constant
monoids
[i.e.,
“Ψcns
”]
involved.
On
the
other
hand,
such
Galois-invariants
or
Galois-orbits
are
clearly
insuﬃcient
for
conducting
Kummer
theory
[cf.
[IUTchIII],
Remark
1.5.1,
(ii),
for
a
discussion
of
a
related
topic].
Moreover,
the
operation
of
passing
to
sets
of
Galois-orbits
fails
to
be
compatible
with
the
ring
structure
—
e.g.,
the
additive
structure
—
on
[the
formal
union
with
“{0}”
of]
the
various
constant
monoids.
Such
an
incompatibility
is
unacceptable
in
the
context
of
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers
since
it
is
impossible
to
develop
the
theory
of
the
log-wall
[cf.
[AbsTopIII];
[IUTchIII]]
without
applying
the
ring
structure
within
each
Hodge
theater
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
3.6.4,
(i)].
(iii)
As
discussed
at
the
beginning
of
§1,
the
problem
of
giving
an
explicit
description
of
what
one
arithmetic
holomorphic
structure
looks
like
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
distinct
arithmetic
holomorphic
structure
that
is
only
related
to
the
original
arithmetic
holomorphic
structure
via
some
mono-analytic
core
is
one
of
the
central
themes
of
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers.
The
phenomenon
of
conjugate
synchronization
as
discussed
in
(i)
and
(ii)
above,
as
well
as
the
closely
related
phenomenon
of
mono-theta-theoretic
cyclotomic
rigidity
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
3.6.5,
(ii)],
may
be
thought
of
as
particular
instances
of
this
general
theme.
Indeed,
from
the
point
of
view
of
classical
discussions
of
scheme-theoretic
arithmetic
geometry,
the
“natural
isomorphisms”
that
exist
between
various
cyclotomes
that
appear
in
a
discussion
are
typically
taken
for
granted
INTER-UNIVERSAL
TEICHMÜLLER

—
i.e.,
typically
no
attention
is
given
to
the
issue
of
devising
explicit,
intrinsic
reconstruction
algorithms
for
these
“natural
isomorphisms”
between
cyclotomes.

Section
4:
Global
Gaussian
Frobenioids
In
the
present
§4,
we
generalize
the
theory
of
Gaussian
monoids,
developed
in
§3
in
the
case
of
bad
v
∈
Vbad
,
ﬁrst
to
the
case
of
nonarchimedean
and
archimedean
good
v
∈
Vgood
and
then
to
the
global
case.
One
important
feature
of
these
generalizations,
especially
in
the
global
case,
is
the
theme
of
compatibility
with
the
theory
of
ΘNF-
(respectively,
Θ±ell

Hodge
theaters
—
and,
in
particu±
lar,
the
F

(respectively,
Fl

symmetries
of
such
Hodge
theaters
—
developed
in
[IUTchI],
§4,
§5
(respectively,
[IUTchI],
§6).
In
the
following
discussion,
we
assume
that
we
have
been
given
initial
Θdata
as
in
[IUTchI],
Deﬁnition

We
begin
our

Proof.
The
various
assertions
of

follow
immediately
from

deﬁnitions
and
the
references
quoted
in
the
statements
of
these


Remark
4.1.1.
(i)
Proposition
4.1
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“easy”
formal
generalization
of
much
of
the
theory
of
§2,
§3
—
more
precisely,
the
portion
constituted
by
Proposition
3.1
and
Corollaries
2.4,
3.5
—
to
the
case
of
v
∈
Vgood
Vnon
.
By
comparison
to
the
corresponding
portion
of
the
theory
of
§2,
§3,
this
generalization
is
somewhat
tautological
and,
for
the
most
part,
“vacuous”.
As
we
shall
see
later,
the
reason
for
considering
this
formal
generalization
to
v
∈
Vgood
Vnon
is
that
it
allows
one
to
“globalize”
the
theory
of
§2,
§3,
i.e.,
by
gluing
together
the
theories
at
v
∈
Vbad
and
v
∈
Vgood
.
(ii)
The
symmetrizing
isomorphisms
of
Proposition
4.1,
(iii),
constitute
the
analogue
at
v
∈
Vgood
Vnon
of
the
conjugate
synchronization
at
v
∈
Vbad
discussed
in
Corollary
3.5,
(i);
Remark
3.5.2.
In
this
context,
it
is
perhaps
most
INTER-UNIVERSAL
TEICHMÜLLER
THEORY
II
123
natural
to
think
of
the
“copies
of
Gv
(Πv
)
labeled
by
t
∈
LabCusp±
(Πv
)”
as
the
quotients
Dt
/It
—
where
It
is
a
cuspidal
inertia
group
⊆
Πv
corresponding
to
t;
Dt
is
the
corresponding
decomposition
group
⊆
Πv
[i.e.,
the
normalizer,
or,
equivalently,
the
commensurator,
of
It
in
Πv
—
cf.,
e.g.,
[AbsSect],
Theorem
1.3,
(ii)];
we
think
∼
of
Dt
/It
as
being
equipped
with
the
isomorphism
Dt
/It
→
Gv
(Πv
)
induced
by
the
natural
surjection
Πv

Gv
(Πv
).
(iii)
One
may
also
formulate
an
easy
tautological
formal
analogue
at
v
∈
Vgood
Vnon
of
the
multiradiality
and
uniradiality
assertions
of
Proposition
3.4,
Corollary
3.7
at
v
∈
V.
For
instance,
(a)
the
construction
of
the
monoids
Ψcns
(Πv
)
[cf.
Proposition
4.1,
(i)]
is
uniradial
[cf.
Proposition
3.4,
(ii)],
while
(b)
the
construction
of
the
monoids
Ψss
cns
(Πv
),
Ψenv
(Πv
),
and
Ψgau
(Πv
)
[cf.
∼
Proposition
4.1,
(ii),
(iv)],
as
well
as
of
the
isomorphism
Ψenv
(Πv
)
→
Ψgau
(Πv
)
[cf.
Proposition
4.1,
(iv)],
is
multiradial.
We
leave
the
routine
details
to
the
reader.
Ultimately,
in
the
present
series
of
papers
[cf.,
especially,
the
theory
of
[IUTchIII]],
we
shall
be
interested
in
a
global
analogue
of
the
theory
of
multiradiality
and
uniradiality
developed
in
§1,
§3
at
v
∈
Vbad
.
This
global
analogue
will
“specialize”
to
the
theory
of
§1,
§3
at
v
∈
Vbad
and
to
the
formal
analogue
just
discussed
[i.e.,
(a),
(b)]
at
v
∈

Vnon

Ψgau

[cf.

replacing
the

by
the
realiﬁcation
of
the
quotient
of
this
ind-topological

by
its
submonoid

Finally,
there
is
a

with
the

Proof.
The
various
assertions
of
Corollary

follow
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions
and
the
references
quoted
in
the
statements
of
these


Remark
4.5.1.
(i)
Just
as
was
done
in
Deﬁnition
3.8,
one
may
interpret
the
various
collections
of
monoids
constructed
in
Corollary
4.5,
(i),
(iv)
as
collections
of
Frobenioids.
That
is
to
say,
the
collection
of
monoids
discussed
in
Corollary
4.5,
(i),
gives
rise
to
an
F-prime-strip,
hence
also
to
an
associated
F

-prime-strip.
In
a
similar
vein,
the
theta
and
Gaussian
monoids
of
Corollary
4.5,
(iv),
give
rise
to
a
well-deﬁned
F

prime-strip
—
up
to
an
indeterminacy,
at
the
v
∈
Vbad
[corresponding
to
the
various
2l-th
roots
of
the
square
of
the
theta
function
and
“value-proﬁles”],
relative
to
automorphisms
of
the
split
Frobenioid
at
such
v
∈
Vbad
that
induce
the
identity
automorphism
on
the
subcategory
of
isometries
[cf.
[FrdI],
Theorem
5.1,
(iii)]
of
the
underlying
category
of
the
split
Frobenioid
—
cf.
Remark
4.10.1
below.
On
the
other
hand,
as
discussed
in
Remark
3.8.1,
this
Frobenioid-theoretic
formulation
is
—
by
comparison
to
the
original
monoid-theoretic
formulation
—
technically
ill-suited
to
discussions
of
conjugate
synchronization.

(ii)
On
the
other
hand,
such
technical
complications
do
not
occur
if
one
restricts
oneself
to
discussions
of
realiﬁcations
—
cf.,
e.g.,
the
objects
“R≥0
(‡
D
)v
”,
“D
(‡
D
)”
discussed
in
Corollary
4.5,
(ii).
In
general,
Frobenioid-theoretic
formulations
are
typically
technically
easier
to
work
with
than
monoid-theoretic
formulations
when
the
associated
“Picard
groups
P
icΦ
(−)”
[cf.
[FrdI],
Theorem
5.1;
[FrdI],
Theorem
6.4,
(i);
[IUTchI],
Remark
3.1.5]
contain
nontorsion
elements
—
i.e.,
at
a
more
intuitive
level,
when
there
is
a
nontrivial
notion
of
the
“degree”
of
a
line
bundle.
Examples
of
such
Frobenioids
include
global
arithmetic
Frobenioids
such
as
the
Frobenioid
“D
(‡
D
)”
of
Corollary
4.5,
(ii),
as
well
as
the
tempered
Frobenioids
that
appeared
in
Propositions
3.3
and
3.4;
Corollary
3.6.
Remark
4.5.2.
(i)
One
may
also
construct
symmetrizing
isomorphisms
as
in
Corollary
4.5,
(iii),
for
versions
labeled
by
t
∈
LabCusp±

of

equipped
with

and

and

Frobenioids
D
(†
D
),
equipped
with
bijections
and
local
isomorphisms
of
topological
monoids,
as
discussed
in
Corollary
4.5,
(iii).
We
leave
the
routine
details
to
the
reader.
(ii)
Just
as
was
discussed
in
Remark
3.5.3,
one
may
also
consider
“multibasepoint”
versions
of
the
symmetrizing
isomorphisms
of
Corollary
4.5,
(iii)
[cf.
also
the
discussion
of
(i)
above]
—
i.e.,
by
passing
to
D-Θell
-bridges
or
[holomorphic
or
mono-analytic]
capsules
or
processions
[cf.
[IUTchI],
Proposition
6.8,
(i),
(ii),
(iii);
[IUTchI],
Proposition
6.9,
(i),
(ii)].
We
leave
the
routine
details
to
the
reader.
Remark
4.5.3.
Before
proceeding,
we
pause
to
review
the
signiﬁcance
of
the
F±
l
-symmetry
that
gives
rise
to
the
symmetrizing
isomorphisms
of
Corollary
4.5,
(iii)
[cf.
Remark
3.5.2].
(i)
First,
we
recall
that
the
crucial
conjugate
synchronization
established
in
Corollaries
3.5,
(i);
4.5,
(iii)
[cf.
also
Propositions
4.1,
(iii);
4.3,
(iii)],
is
possible

in
the
case
of
the
F±
l
-symmetry
—
but
not
in
the
case
of
the
Fl
-symmetry!
—
precisely
because
of
the
connectedness,
at
each
v
∈
V,
of
the
local
components
involved
—
cf.
the
discussion
of
Remarks
2.6.1,
(i);
2.6.2,
(i);
3.5.2,
(ii),
as
well
as
[IUTchI],
Remark
6.12.4,
(i),
(ii).
Here,
we
note
in
passing
that
although
these
remarks
essentially
only
concern
v
∈
Vbad
,
similar
[but,
in
some
sense,
easier!]
remarks
hold
at
v
∈
Vgood
.
A
related
property
of
the
F±
l
-symmetry
—
which,

again,
is
not
satisﬁed
by
the
Fl
-symmetry!
—
is
the
“geometric”
nature
of
the
automorphisms
that
give
rise
to
this
symmetry
[cf.
Remark
3.5.2,
(iii)].
(ii)
One
way
to
understand
the
signiﬁcance
of
the
“single
basepoint”
symmetrizing
isomorphisms
arising
from
the
F±
l
-symmetry
is
to
compare
these
symmetrizing
isomorphisms
with
the
symmetrizing
isomorphisms
that
arise
from
the
various
“multi-basepoint”
[i.e.,
“multi-connected
component”]
symmetries
discussed
in
Remarks
3.5.3;
4.5.2,
(ii).
That
is
to
say:
(a)
By
comparison
to
the
symmetries
that
arise
from
mono-analytic
capsules/processions:
the
ring
structure
—
i.e.,
“arithmetic
holomorphic
136
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
structure”
—
that
remains
intact
in
the
case
of
the
symmetrizing
isomorphisms
of
Corollary
4.5,
(iii),
will
play
an
essential
role
in
the
theory
of
the
log-wall
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
3.6.4,
(i)],
which
we
shall
apply
in
[IUTchIII].
(b)
By
comparison
to
the
symmetries
that
arise
from
holomorphic
capsules/processions:
the
“single
basepoint”
that
remains
intact
in
the
case
of
the
symmetrizing
isomorphisms
of
Corollary
4.5,
(iii),
is
used
not
only
to
establish
conjugate
synchronization,
but
also
to
maintain
a
bijective
link
with
the
set
of
labels
in
“LabCusp±
(−)”
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
3.5.2].
Both
conjugate
synchronization
and
the
bijective
link
with
the
set
of
labels
play
crucial
roles
in
the
theory
of
Galois-theoretic
theta
evaluation
developed
in
§3
[cf.
the
various
remarks
following
Corollaries
3.5,
3.6;
Remark
3.8.3].
(c)
By
comparison
to
the
symmetries
that
arise
from
the
F±
l
-symmetries
of
ell
ell
D-Θ
-bridges:
Although
the
structure
of
a
D-Θ
-bridge
allows
one
to
maintain
a
bijective
link
with
the
set
of
labels
in
“LabCusp±
(−)”
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],
Remark
4.9.2,
(i);
[IUTchI],
Remark
6.12.4,
(i)],
ell
the
multi-basepoint
nature
of
the
F±
l
-symmetries
of
D-Θ
-bridges
does
not
allow
one
to
establish
conjugate
synchronization
[cf.
(b)].
(iii)
Note
that
in
order
to
glue
together
the
various
local
F±
l
-symmetries
of
Corollary
3.5,
(i),
and
Propositions
4.1,
(iii);
4.3,
(iii),
so
as
to
obtain
the
global
F±
l
-symmetry
of
Corollary
4.5,
(iii),
it
is
necessary
to
make
use
of
the
global
portion
“†
D±
”
of
the
D-Θ±ell
-Hodge
theater
under
consideration
—
i.e.,
by
applying
the
theory
of
[IUTchI],
Proposition
6.5
[cf.
also
[IUTchI],
Remark
6.12.4,
(iii)].
That
is
to
say,
the
global
portion
of
the
D-Θ±ell
-Hodge
theater
under
consideration
plays,
in
particular,
the
role
of
synchronizing
the
±-indeterminacies
at
each
v
∈
V.
Indeed,
in
some
sense,
this
is
precisely
the
content
of
[IUTchI],
Proposition
6.5.
In
particular,
the
essential
role
played
in
this
context
by
“†
D±
”
in
synchronizing,
or
coordinating,
the
various
local
±-indeterminacies
is
one
important
underlying
cause
for
the
proﬁnite
conjugacy
indeterminacies
—
i.e.,
“Δ”-conjugacy
indeterminacies
—
that
occur
in
Corollaries
2.4,
2.5
—
cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
2.5.2.
Thus,
in
summary,
these
local
±-indeterminacies
constitute
one
important
reason
for
the
need
to
apply
the
“complements
on
tempered
coverings”
developed
in
[IUTchI],
§2,
in
the
proof
of
Corollary
2.4
of
the
present
paper.
Remark
4.5.4.
In
the
situation
of
Corollary
4.5,
(v),
we
remark
that
the
Frobe
(†
D
)
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“weighted
diagonal”,
relative
to
nioid
Dgau
the
weights
determined
by
the
vector
“(.
.
.
,
j
2
·,
.
.
.
)”.
That
is
to
say,
at
a
more
concrete
level,
the
divisor
monoid
(respectively,
rational
function
monoid)
of
this
Frobenioid
consists
of
elements
of
the
form
(12

—
where

is
an
element

to
the

Remark

Similar
observations
to
the
observations
made
in
Remark
4.5.2,
(i),
(ii),
concerning
the
F±
l
-symmetrizing
isomorphisms
of
Corollary
4.5,
(iii),
may
be
made
in
the
case
of
the
F
l
-symmetrizing
isomorphisms
of
Corollary
4.7,
(ii).
Remark
4.7.2.
In
the
context
of
Corollary
4.7,
(ii),
we
recall
from
Remarks

3.5.2,
(iii);
4.5.3,
(i),
that
unlike
the
case
with
F±
l
-symmetry,
in
the
case
of
Fl
symmetry,
it
is
not
possible
to
establish
the
sort
of
conjugate
synchronization
given
in
Corollary
4.5,
(iii),
since
the
F
l
-symmetry
involves
—
i.e.,
more
precisely,
arises
from
conjugation
by
elements
with
nontrivial
image
in
—
the
arithmetic
portion
[i.e.,
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
the
base
ﬁeld]
of
the
global
arithmetic
fundamental
groups
involved
[cf.
the
discussion
of
how
“GK
-conjugacy
indeterminacies
give
rise
to
Gv
-conjugacy
indeterminacies”
in
Remark
2.5.2,
(iii)].
It
is
precisely
this
state
of
aﬀairs
that
obliges
us,
in
Corollary
4.7,
(ii),
to
work
with
(a)
F-prime-strips,
as
opposed
to
the
corresponding
ind-topological
monoids
with
Galois
actions
as
in
Corollary
4.5,
(iii),
and
with
(b)
the
various
objects
introduced
in
Corollary
4.7,
(i),
that
are
equipped
with
sub-/super-scripts
“mod”,
“sol”,
“κ-sol”,
or
“∞
κ”
—
corresponding
to
“Fmod
”,
“Fsol
”,
“π1κ-sol
(−)”,
or
“∞
κ-coric
rational
rat/κ-sol
functions”
—
or
[as
in
the
case
of
“π1
(−)”]
are
only
deﬁned
up
to
certain
conjugacy
indeterminacies,
as
opposed
to
the
objects
not
equipped
with
such
subscripts
or
not
subject
to
such
conjugacy
indeterminacies.
That
is
to
say,
both
(a)
and
(b)
allow
one
to
ignore
the
various
independent
—
i.e.,
non-synchronizable
—
conjugacy
indeterminacies
that
occur
at
the
various
distinct
labels
as
a
consequence
of
the
single
basepoint
with
respect
to
which
one
considers
both
the
labels
and
the
labeled
objects
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
3.5.2,
(ii)].
Here,
it
is
also
useful
to
observe
that
by
working
with
the
various
objects
introduced
in
Corollary
4.7,
(i),
that
are
equipped
with
a
sub-/super-script
“mod”,
“sol”,
or
“κ-sol”
—
i.e.,
on
which
the
various
conjugacy
indeterminacies
involved
act
in
a
synchronized
fashion
—
one
may
construct
the
various
diagonal
subcategories
associated
to
the
corresponding
Frobenioids
in
a
fashion
in
which
one
is
not
obliged
to
contend
with
the
technical
subtleties
that
arise
from
independent
conjugacy
indeterminacies
at
distinct
labels
[cf.
the
discussion
of
“Galois-invariants/Galoisorbits”
in
Remark
3.8.3,
(ii)].
In
[IUTchIII],
the
ring
structure
on
these
objects
equipped
with
a
subscript
“mod”
will
be
applied
as
a
sort
of
translation
apparatus
between
“
-line
bundles”
[i.e.,
arithmetic
line
bundles
thought
of
as
additive
modules
with
additional
structure]
and
“
-line
bundles”
[i.e.,
arithmetic
line
bundles
thought
of
“multiplicatively”
or
“idèlically”,
as
in
the
theory
of
Frobenioids]
—
cf.
[AbsTopIII],
Deﬁnition
5.3,
(i),
(ii).
Remark
4.7.3.
At
this
point,
it
is
of
interest
to
review
the
signiﬁcance
of
the

F±
l
-
and
Fl
-symmetries
in
the
context
of
the
theory
of
the
present
§4.
(i)
First,
we
recall
that,
in
the
context
of
the
present
series
of
papers,
the
“Fl
”

that
appears
in
the
notation
“F±
l
”
and
“Fl
”
is
to
be
thought
of
—
since
l
is
144
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
“large”
—
as
a
sort
of
ﬁnite
approximation
of
the
ring
of
rational
integers
Z
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],
Remark
6.12.3,
(i)].
That
is
to
say,
the
F±
l
-symmetry

corresponds
to
the
additive
structure
of
Z,
while
the
Fl
-symmetry
corresponds
to
the
multiplicative
structure
of
Z.
Since
the
“Fl
”
under
consideration
arises
from
the
torsion
points
of
an
elliptic
curve,
it
is
natural
—
especially
in
light
of
the
central
role
played
in
the
present
series
of
papers
by
v
∈
Vbad
—
to
think
of
the
“Z”
under
consideration
as
the
Galois
group
“Z”
of
the
universal
combinatorial
covering
of
the
Tate
curves
that
appear
at
v
∈
Vbad
[cf.
the
discussion
at
the
beginning
of
[EtTh],
§1].
In
particular,
in
light
of
the
theory
of
Tate
curves,
it
is
natural
to
think
of
this
“Z”
as
representing
a
sort
of
universal
version
of
the
value
group
associated
to
a
local
ﬁeld
that
occurs
at
a
v
∈
Vbad
,
and
to
think
of
the
element
0
∈
Z
—
hence,
the
label
0
∈
|Fl
|
—
as
representing
the
units.

(ii)
Perhaps
the
most
fundamental
diﬀerence
between
the
F±
l
-
and
Fl
-symmetries
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
F±
l
-symmetry
involves
the
zero
label
0
∈
|Fl
|
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],
Remark
6.12.5].
In
particular,
the
F±
l
-symmetry
is
suited
to
application
to
the
“units”
—
i.e.,
to
the
various
local
“O×
”
and
“O×μ
”
that
appear
in
the
theory.
At
a
more
technical
level,
this
relationship
between
the
×
F±
l
-symmetry
and
“O
”
may
be
seen
in
the
theory
of
§3
[cf.
also
Corollaries
4.5,
(iii);
4.6,
(iii)].
That
is
to
say,
in
§3
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
3.8.3],
the
F±
l
symmetry
is
applied
precisely
to
establish
conjugate
synchronization,
which,
in
turn,
will
be
applied
eventually
to
establish
the
crucial
coricity
of
“O×μ
”
in
the
context
of
the
Θ×μ
gau
-link
[cf.
Corollary
4.10,
(iv),
below].
Here,
let
us
observe
that
the
conjugate
synchronization,
established
by
means
of
the
F±
l
-symmetry,
of
copies
of
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
the
local
base
ﬁeld
at
various
v
∈
Vnon
is
a
very
delicate
property
that
depends
quite
essentially
on
the
“arithmetic
holomorphic
structure”
of
the
Hodge
theaters
under
consideration.
That
is
to
say,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
theory
of
§1,
conjugate
synchronization
in
one
Hodge
theater
fails
to
be
compatible
with
conjugate
synchronization
in
another
Hodge
theater
with
a
distinct
arithmetic
holomorphic
structure.
Put
another
way,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
theory
of
§1,
conjugate
synchronization
can
only
be
naturally
formulated
in
a
uniradial
fashion.
This
uniradiality
may
also
be
seen
at
a
purely
combinatorial
level,
as
we
shall
discuss
in
Remark
4.7.4
below.
On
the
other
hand,
if
one
passes
to
mono-analyticizations
—
e.g.,
to
mono-analytic
processions
—
then
the
monoanalytic
“O×μ
”
that
appears
in
the
Θ×μ
gau
-link
[cf.
Corollary
4.10,
(iv),
below]
is,
by
contrast,
coric.
That
is
to
say,
by
relating
the
zero
label,
which
is
common
to
distinct
arithmetic
holomorphic
structures,
to
the
various
nonzero
labels,
which
belong
to
a
single
ﬁxed
arithmetic
holomorphic
structure,
the
condition
of
invariance
with
respect
to
the
F±
l
-symmetry
may
—
e.g.,
in
the
case
of
the
mono-analytic
“O×μ
”
—
amount
to
a
condition
of
coricity.
In
particular,
in
the
case
of
the
mono-analytic
“O×μ
”,
the
F±
l
-symmetry
plays
the
role
of
establishing
the
coric
pieces
—
i.e.,
components
which
are
“uniform”
with
respect
to
all
of
the
distinct
arithmetic
holomorphic
structures
involved
—
of
the
apparatus
to
be
established
in
the
present
series
of
papers.
INTER-UNIVERSAL
TEICHMÜLLER
THEORY

145
This
dual
role
—
i.e.,
consisting
of
both
uniradial
and
coric
aspects
—
played
by
the
F±
l
-symmetry
is
to
be
considered
in
contrast
to
the
strictly
multiradial
role
[cf.
(iii)
below]
played
by
the
F
l
-symmetry.
Also,
in
this
context,
we
observe
that
the
symmetrization,
eﬀected
by
the
F±
l
-symmetry,
between
zero
and
nonzero
labels
may
be
thought
of,
from
the
point
of
view
of
(i),
as
a
symmetrization
between
[local]
units
and
value
groups
and,
hence,
in
particular,
is
reminiscent
of
the
intertwining
of
units
and
value
groups
eﬀected
by
the
log-link
[cf.
[IUTchIII],
Remark
3.12.2,
(i),
(ii)],
as
well
as
of
the
crucial
compatibility
between
the
F±
l
symmetrizing
isomorphisms
[i.e.,
that
give
rise
to
the
conjugate
synchronization]
and
the
log-link
[cf.
[IUTchIII],
Remark
1.3.2].
(iii)
The
signiﬁcance
of
the
F
l
-symmetry
lies,
in
a
word,
in
the
fact
that
it
allows
one
to
separate
the
zero
label
from
the
nonzero
labels.
From
the
point
of
view
of
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers,
this
property
makes
the
F
l
symmetry
well-suited
for
the
construction/description
of
the
internal
structure
of
the
Gaussian
monoids,
which
are,
in
eﬀect,
“distributions”
or
“functions”
of
a
parameter
j
∈
F
l
[cf.
Corollaries
4.5,
(iv),
(v);
4.6,
(iv),
(v)].
Here,
we
note
that
this
separation
of
the
zero
label
—
which
parametrizes
coric
data
that
is
common
to
distinct
arithmetic
holomorphic
structures
—
from
the
nonzero
labels
—
which
parametrize
the
components
of
the
Gaussian
monoid
associated
to
a
particular
arithmetic
holomorphic
structure
—
is
crucial
from
the
point
of
view
of
describing
the
Gaussian
monoid
associated
to
a
particular
arithmetic
holomorphic
structure
in
terms
that
may
be
understood
from
the
point
of
view
of
some
“alien”
arithmetic
holomorphic
structure.
Put
another
way,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
theory
of
§1,
the
F
l
-symmetry
admits
a
natural
multiradial
formulation.
This
multiradiality
may
also
be
seen
at
a
purely
combinatorial
level,
as
we
shall
discuss
in
Remark
4.7.4
below.
In
this
context,
it
is
important
to
note
that
if
one
thinks
of
the
coric
constant
distribution,
labeled
by
zero,
as
embedded
via
the
diagonal
embedding
into
the
various
products
parametrized
by
j
∈
F
l
that
appear
in
the
construction
of
the
Gaussian
monoids
[cf.
the
isomorphisms
that
appear
in
the
ﬁnal
displays
of
Corollaries
4.5,
(iii);
4.6,
(iii)],
then
it
is
natural
to
think
of
the
volumes
computed
at

each
j
∈
F
l
as
being
assigned
a
weight
1/l
—
i.e.,
so
that
the
diagonal
embedding
of
the
constant
distribution
is
compatible
with
taking
the
constant
distribution
to
be
of
weight
1
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],
Remark
5.4.2].
Put
another
way,
from
the
point
of
view
of
“computation
of
weighted
volumes”,
the
various
nonzero

j
∈
F
l
are
“subordinate”
to
0
∈
|Fl
|
—
i.e.,
Fl

j
≪
0.
In
particular,
to
symmetrize,
in
the
context
of
the
internal
structure
of
the
Gaussian
monoids,
the
zero
and
nonzero
labels
[i.e.,
as
in
the
case
of
the
F±
l
-symmetry!]
amounts
to
allowing
a
relation
“0
≪
0”
—
which
is
absurd
[i.e.,
in
the
sense
that
it
fails
to
be
compatible
with
weighted
volume
computations]!
Remark
4.7.4.
(i)
One
way
to
understand
the
underlying
combinatorial
structure
of
the

uniradiality
of
the
F±
l
-symmetry
and
the
multiradiality
of
the
Fl
-symmetry
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
4.7.3,
(ii),
(iii)]
is
to
consider
these
symmetries
—
which
146
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
are
deﬁned
relative
to
some
given
arithmetic
holomorphic
structure
[or,
at
a
more
technical
level,
some
given
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theater
—
cf.
[IUTchI],
Deﬁnition
6.13,
(i)]
—
in
the
context
of
the
étale-pictures
that
arise
from
each
of
these
symmetries

[cf.
[IUTchI],
Corollaries
4.12,
6.10].
In
the
case
of
the
F±
l
-
(respectively,
Fl
-)
symmetry,
this

étale-picture
consists
of
a
collection
of
copies
of
Fl
(respectively,
|Fl
|
=
F
{0}),
each
copy
corresponding
to
a
single
arithmetic
holomorphic
l
structure,
which
are
glued
together
at
the
coric
label
0
∈
Fl
(respectively,
0
∈
|Fl
|).
In
Fig.
4.1
(respectively,
4.2)
below,
an
illustration
is
given
of
such
an
étale-picture,
in
which
the
notation
“±”
(respectively,
“”)
is
used
to
denote
the
various
elements
of
Fl
\
{0}
(respectively,
F
l
)
in
each
copy
of
Fl
(respectively,
|Fl
|).
Moreover,
on
each
copy
of
Fl
(respectively,
|Fl
|)
—
labeled,
say,
by
some
spoke
α
[corresponding
to
a
single
arithmetic
holomorphic
structure]
—
one
has
a
natural
action
of
a
“corresponding
copy”
of
F±
(respectively,
F
l
l
).
(ii)
The
fundamental
diﬀerence
between
the
simple
combinatorial
models
of
the
étale-pictures
considered
in
(i)
lies
in
the
fact
that
whereas
±
(a)
in
the
case
of
the
F±
l
-symmetry,
the
Fl
-actions
on
distinct
spokes
fail
to
commute
with
one
another,

(b)
in
the
case
of
the
F
l
-symmetry,
the
Fl
-actions
on
distinct
spokes
commute
with
one
another
and,
moreover,
are
compatible
with
the
permutations
of
spokes
discussed
in
[IUTchI],
Corollary
4.12,
(iii).
Indeed,
the
noncommutativity,
or
“incompatibility
with
simultaneous
execution
at
distinct
spokes”
[cf.
Remark
1.9.1],
of
(a)
is
a
direct
consequence
of
the
inclusion
of
the
zero
label
in
the
F±
l
-symmetry
and
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
prototypical
combinatorial
representation
of
the
phenomenon
of
uniradiality.
By
contrast,
the
commutativity,
or
“compatibility
with
simultaneous
execution
at
distinct
spokes”
[cf.
Remark
1.9.1],
of
(b)
is
a
direct
consequence
of
the
exclusion
of
the
zero
label
from
the
F
l
-symmetry
and
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
prototypical
combinatorial
representation
of
the
phenomenon
of
multiradiality.
Note
that
in
the
case
of
the
F±
l
-symmetry,
it
is
also
a
direct
consequence
of
the
inclusion
of
the
zero
label
that
the
condition
of
invariance
with
respect
to
the
F±
l
-actions
on
all
of
the
spokes
may
be
thought
of
as
a
condition
of
“uniformity”
among
the
elements
of
the
copies
of
Fl
at
the
various
spokes,
hence
as
a
sort
of
coricity
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
4.7.3,
(ii)].

and
multiradiality
discussed
in
(ii)
above
are
not
formulated
in
terms
of
the
formalism
of
uniradial
and
multiradial
environments
developed
in
§1
[cf.
Example
1.7,
(ii)],
it
is
not
diﬃcult
to
produce
such
a
formulation.
For
instance,
one
may
take
the
coric
data
to
consist
of
objects
of
the
form
“0α
”
—
i.e.,
the
zero
label,
subscripted
by
the
label
α
associated
to
some
spoke.
For
any
two
spokes
α,
β,
we
deﬁne
the
set
of
arrows
0α
→
0β
to
consist
of
precisely
one
element
(α,
β).
We
then
take,
in
the
case
of
the
F±
l
-)
symmetry,
the
radial
data
to
consist
of
a
copy
(F
)
(respectively,
(respectively,
F
l
α
l
|Fl
|α
)
of
Fl
(respectively,
|Fl
|)
subscripted
by
the
label
α
associated
to
some
spoke.
For
any
two
spokes
α,
β,
we
deﬁne
the
set
of
arrows
(Fl
)α
→
(Fl
)β
(respectively,
|Fl
|α
→
|Fl
|β
)
to
consist
of
precisely
one
element
if
the
actions
(F±
l
)γ

(Fl
)γ
(respectively,
(F
)

(|F
|)
),
for
γ
=
α,
β,
determine
an
action
of
l
γ
l
γ
±

(respectively,
(F
(F±
l
)α
×
(Fl
)β
l
)α
×
(Fl
)β
)


on
the
co-product
(Fl
)α
0
(Fl
)β
(respectively,
(|Fl
|)α
0
(|Fl
|)β
)
obtained
by
identifying
the
respective
zero
labels
0α
,
0β
,
and
to
equal
the
empty
set
if
such
an
action
does
not
exist.
Then
one
has
a
natural
radial
functor
(Fl
)α
→
0α
(respectively,
|Fl
|α
→
0α
)
that
associates
coric
data
to
radial
data.
Moreover,
the
resulting
radial
environment
is
easily
seen
to
be
uniradial
(respectively,
multiradial).
We
leave
the
routine
details
to
the
reader.
Finally,
we
note
in
passing
that
the
formulation
involving
products
given
above
is
reminiscent
both
of
the
discussion
of
the
switching
functor
in
Example
1.7,
(iii),
and
of
the
discussion
of
parallel
transport
via
connections
in
Remark
1.7.1.
Remark
4.7.5.
In
the
context
of
the
discussion
of
the
combinatorial
models
±

of
the
Fl
-
and
Fl
-symmetries
in
Remark
4.7.4,
it
is
useful
to
recall
that
the

F±
l
-
and
Fl
-symmetries
correspond,
respectively,
to
the
additive
and
multiplicative
structures
of
the
ﬁeld
Fl
—
which
[cf.
Remark
4.7.3,
(i)]
we
wish
to
think
of
as
a
sort
of
ﬁnite
approximation
of
the
ring
Z.
That
is
to
say,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers,

(a)
the
F±
l
-
and
Fl
-symmetries
correspond,
respectively,
to
the
two
combinatorial
dimensions
—
i.e.,
addition
and
multiplication
—
of
a
ring
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[AbsTopIII],
§I3].

Moreover,
in
the
context
of
the
discussion
of
Remark
4.7.3,
(i),
concerning
units
and
value
groups,
it
is
useful
to
recall
that
these
two
combinatorial
dimensions
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
(b)
the
units
and
value
group
of
a
mixed-characteristic
nonarchimedean
or
complex
archimedean
local
ﬁeld
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[AbsTopIII],
§I3]
or,
alternatively,
to
(c)
the
two
cohomological
dimensions
of
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
a
mixed-characteristic
nonarchimedean
local
ﬁeld
or
the
two
underlying
real
dimensions
of
a
complex
archimedean
local
ﬁeld
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[AbsTopIII],
§I3].
Finally,
the
hierarchical
structure
of
these
two
dimensions
—
i.e.,
the
way
in
which
“one
dimension
[i.e.,
multiplication]
is
piled
on
top
of
the
other
[i.e.,
addition]”
—
is
reﬂected
in
the
(d)
subordination
structure
“≪”,
relative
to
the
computation
of
weighted
volumes,
of
nonzero
labels
with
respect
to
the
zero
label
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
4.7.3,
(iii)].
as
well
as
in
the
fact
that
(e)
the
F±
l
-symmetry
arises
from
the
conjugation
action
of
the
geometric
fundamental
group
[cf.
Remarks
3.5.2,
(iii);
4.5.3,
(i)],
whereas
the
F
l
symmetry
arises
from
the
conjugation
action
of
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
the
global
base
ﬁeld
[cf.
Remark
4.7.2]
—
i.e.,
where
we
recall
that
the
arithmetic
fundamental
groups
involved
may
be
thought
of
as
having
a
natural
hierarchical
structure
constituted
by
their
extension
structure
[corresponding
to
the
natural
outer
action
of
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
the
base
ﬁeld
on
the
geometric
fundamental
group].
Remark
4.7.6.
One
important
observation
in
the
context
of
Corollary
4.7,
(i),
is
that
it
makes
sense
to
consider
non-realiﬁed
global
Frobenioids
[corresponding,
e.g.,
to
“Fmod
”]
only
in
the
case
of
the
F
l
-symmetry.
Indeed,
in
order
to
consider
the
ﬁeld
“Fmod
”
from
an
anabelian,
or
Galois-theoretic,
point
of
view,
it
is
necessary
to
consider
the
full
proﬁnite
group
ΠCF
—
i.e.,
not
just
the
open
subgroups
ΠC
K
,
ΠX
K
of
ΠCF
which
give
rise,
respectively,
to
the
global
portions
of
the
±
F
l
-
and
Fl
-symmetries
[cf.
[IUTchI],
Deﬁnition
4.1,
(v);
[IUTchI],
Deﬁnition
6.1,
(v)].
On
the
other
hand,
to
work
with
the
abstract
topological
group
ΠCF
means
that
the
subgroups
ΠC
K
,
ΠX
K
of
ΠCF
are
only
well-deﬁned
up
to
ΠCF
-conjugacy.
That
is
to
say,
in
this
context,
the
subgroups
ΠC
K
,
ΠX
K
are
only
well-deﬁned
up
to
automorphisms
arising
from
their
normalizers
in
ΠCF
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],
Remark
6.12.6,
(iii),
(iv)].
In
particular,
in
the
present
context,
one
is
obliged
to
regard
these
groups
ΠC
K
,
ΠX
K
as
being
subject
to
indeterminacies
arising
from
the
natural
F
l
-poly-actions
[i.e.,
actions
by
a
group
that
surjects
nat
urally
onto
Fl
—
cf.
[IUTchI],
Example
4.3,
(iv)]
on
these
groups
—
that
is
to
say,
subject
to
indeterminacies
arising
from
the
natural
F
l
-symmetries
of
these
groups.
Here,
it
is
important
to
note
that
one
cannot
simply
“form
the
quotient
by
the
indeterminacy
constituted
by
these
F
l
-symmetries”
since
this
would
give
INTER-UNIVERSAL
TEICHMÜLLER
THEORY

149
rise
to
“label-crushing”,
i.e.,
to
identifying
to
a
single
point
the
distinct
labels
j
∈
F
l
,
which
play
a
crucial
role
in
the
construction
of
the
Gaussian
monoids
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],
Remark
4.7.1].
But
then
the
F
l
-symmetries
of
ΠC
K
,
ΠX
K
that
one
must
contend
with
necessarily
involve
conjugation
by
elements
of
the
absolute
Galois
groups
of
the
global
base
ﬁelds
involved,
hence
are
fundamentally
incompatible
with
the
establishment
of
conjugate
synchronization
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
4.7.2].
That
is
to
say,
just
as
it
is
necessary
to

(a)
isolate
the
F±
l
-symmetry
from
the
Fl
-symmetry
in
order
to
establish
conjugate
synchronization
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
4.7.2],
it
is
also
necessary
to
±
(b)
isolate
the
F
l
-symmetry
from
the
Fl
-symmetry
in
order
to
work
with
Galois-theoretic
representations
of
the
global
base
ﬁeld
Fmod
.
Indeed,
in
this
context,
it
is
useful
to
recall
that
one
of
the
fundamental
themes
of
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers
consists
precisely
of
the
dismantling
of
the
two
[a
priori
intertwined!]
combinatorial
dimensions
of
a
ring
[cf.
Remarks
4.7.3,
4.7.5;
[AbsTopIII],
§I3].
Remark
4.7.7.
The
theory
of
“tempered
versus
proﬁnite
conjugates”
developed
in
[IUTchI],
§2,
is
applied
in
the
proof
of
Corollary
2.4,
(i),
in
a
setting
which
ultimately
[cf.
Remark
2.6.2,
(i);
Corollary
4.5,
(iii)]
is
seen
to
amount
to
a
certain
local
portion
[at
v
∈
Vbad
]
of
a
[D-]Θ±ell
-Hodge
theater
—
i.e.,
a
setting
in
which
one
considers
the
F±
l
-symmetry.
On
the
other
hand,
in
[IUTchI],
Remark
4.5.1,
(iii),
a
discussion
is
given
in
which
this
theory
of
“tempered
versus
proﬁnite
conjugates”
developed
in
[IUTchI],
§2,
is
applied
in
a
setting
which
constitutes
a
certain
local
portion
[at
v
∈
Vbad
]
of
a
[D-]ΘNF-Hodge
theater.
In
this
context,
it
is
useful
to
note
that
the
point
of
view
of
this
discussion
given
in
[IUTchI],
Remark
4.5.1,
(iii),
may
be
regarded
as
“implicit”
in
the
point
of
view
of
the
theory
of
the
present
§4
in
the
following
sense:
The
proﬁnite
conjugacy

that
occur
in

Remark

(i)
The
realiﬁed

functor
discussed
in
Remark
4.8.1,
(iii),
only
concerns
the
realiﬁcation
of
the
Frobenioid-theoretic
version
Fgau
(†
HT
Θ
)
of
the
Gaussian
monoids.
The
unit
portion
of
the
Gaussian
monoids
will
be
used,
in
the
context
of
the
theory
involving
the
log-wall
that
will
be
developed
in
[IUTchIII],
not
in
its
capacity
as
a
“multiplicative
object”,
but
rather
—
i.e.,
by
applying
the
operation
“log”
to
the
units
at
the
various
v
∈
V,
as
in
the
theory
of
[AbsTopIII]
—
as
an
“additive
object”.
In
this
theory,
the
non-realiﬁed
global
Frobenioids
of
Corollary
4.8,
(i),
will
appear
in
the
context
of
localization
functors/morphisms
—
i.e.,
as
a
sort
of
translation
apparatus
between
-
and
-line
bundles
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
4.7.2]
—
that
relate
these
[multiplicative!]
non-realiﬁed
global
Frobenioids
to
the
[additive!]
images
via
“log”
of
the
units.
Note
that
this
sort
of
construction
—
i.e.,
in
which
the
localization
operations
involving
units
and
value
groups
diﬀer
by
a
shift
via
the
operation
“log”
—
depends,
in
an
essential
way
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
1.12.2,
(iv)],
on
the
natural
splittings
with
which
the
Gaussian
monoids
are
equipped
[cf.
Corollary
4.6,
(iv)].
(ii)
In
the
context
of
(i),
it
is
useful
to
observe
that,
although
the
non-realiﬁed
global
Frobenioids
of
Corollary
4.8,
(i),
may
only
be
considered
in
the
context
of
the
F
l
-symmetry
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
4.7.6],
this
does
not
yield
any
obstacles,
relative
to
the
discussion
in
(i)
of
Gaussian
monoids,
since
Gaussian
monoids
are
most
naturally
considered
as
“functions”
of
a
parameter
j
∈
F
l
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
4.7.3,
(iii)].
(iii)
From
the
point
of
view
of
the
analogy
of
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers
with
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[AbsTopIII],
§I5],
it
is
of
interest
to
note
that
the
construction
discussed
in
(i)
involving
the
use
of
the
natural
splittings
of
Gaussian
monoids
to
consider
“log-shifted
units”
together
with
“non-log-shifted
value
groups”
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
the
situation
that
frequently
occurs
in
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
in
which
an
indigenous
bundle
(E,
∇E
)
equipped
with
a
Hodge
ﬁltration
0

ω
→
E
→
τ

0
on
a
hyperbolic
curve
in
positive
characteristic
is
represented,
in
the
context
of
local
Frobenius
liftings
modulo
higher
powers
of
p,
as
a
direct
sum
Φ∗
τ
⊕
ω
—
where
Φ
denotes
the
Frobenius
morphism
on
the
curve,
which,
as
may
be
recalled
from
the
discussion
of
[AbsTopIII],
§I5,
corresponds,
relative
to
the
analogy
under
consideration,
to
the
operation
“log”
studied
in
[AbsTopIII].

Deﬁnition
4.9.
(i)
Let
C
be
an
arbitrary
Frobenioid.
Write
D
for
the
base
category
of
C.
Suppose
that
D
is
isomorphic
to
the
category
of
connected
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
154
SHINICHI

of
the
spectrum
of
an
MLF
or
a
CAF.
Let
A
be
a
“universal
covering
pro-object”
def
of
D
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Example
3.2,
(i),
(ii)].
Write
G
=
Aut(A)
[so
G
is
isomorphic
to
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
an
MLF
or
a
CAF].
Now
by
evaluating
the
monoid
“O
(−)”
on
D
that
arises
from
the
general
theory
of
Frobenioids
[cf.
[FrdI],
Proposition
2.2]
at
A,
we
thus
obtain
a
monoid
[in
the
usual
sense]
equipped
with
a
natural
action
by
G
G

O
(A)
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Example
3.2,
(ii)].
If
N
is
a
positive
integer,
then
we
shall
write
μN
(A)
⊆
Oμ
(A)
⊆
O×
(A)
for
the
subgroups
of
N
-torsion
elements
[cf.
[FrdII],
Deﬁnition
2.1,
(i)]
and
torsion
elements
of
arbitrary
order;
O×
(A)

O×μN
(A)

O×μ
(A)
for
the
respective
quotients
of
the
submonoid
of
units
O×
(A)
⊆
O
(A)
by
μN
(A),
Oμ
(A).
Thus,
O
(A),
O×
(A),
O×μN
(A),
O×μ
(A),
μN
(A),
and
Oμ
(A)
are
all
equipped
with
natural
G-actions.
Next,
let
us
suppose
that
G
is
nontrivial
[i.e.,
arises
from
an
MLF].
Recall
the
group-theoretic
algorithms
“G
→
(G

O×
(G))”
and
“G
→
(G

O×μ
(G))”
discussed
in
Example
1.8,
(iii),
(iv).
We
deﬁne
a
×-Kummer
structure
(respectively,
×μ-Kummer
structure)
on
C
to
be
a
Z×
(respectively,
Ism-
[cf.
Example
1.8,
(iv)])
orbit
of
isomorphisms
κ×
:
O×
(G)
∼
→
O×
(A)
(respectively,
κ×μ
:
O×μ
(G)
∼
→
O×μ
(A))
of
ind-topological
G-modules.
Note
that
since
any
two
“universal
covering
proobjects”
of
D
are
isomorphic,
it
follows
immediately
that
the
deﬁnition
of
a
×(respectively,
×μ-)
Kummer
structure
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
A.
Next,
let
us
recall
from
Remark
1.11.1,
(b),
that
any
×-Kummer
structure
on
C
is
unique.
In
the
case
of
×μ-Kummer
structures,
let
us
observe
that
a
×μ-Kummer
structure
κ×μ
on
C
determines,
for
each
open
subgroup
H
⊆
G,
a
submodule
κ
(A)
IH
def
=
Im(O×
(G)H
)
⊆
O×μ
(A)
—
namely,
the
image
via
κ×μ
of
the
image
of
O×
(G)H
in
O×μ
(G)H
[where
the
superscript
“H’s”
denote
the
submodules
of
H-invariants].
Conversely,
it
is
essentially
a
tautology
[cf.
the
deﬁnition
of
“Ism”
given
in
Example
1.8,
(iv)!]
that
the
×μ-Kummer
structure
κ×μ
on
C
is
completely
determined
by
the
submodules
κ
(A)
⊆
O×μ
(A)}H
[where
H
ranges
over
the
open
subgroups
of
G],
namely,
as
{IH
∼
the
unique
Ism-orbit
of
G-equivariant
isomorphisms
O×μ
(G)
→
O×μ
(A)
that
maps
κ
(A)
for
each
open
subgroup
H
⊆
G.
That
is
to
say,
O×
(G)H
onto
IH
a
×μ-Kummer
structure
κ×μ
on
C
may
be
thought
of
as
—
i.e.,
in
the
sense
that
it
determines
and
is
uniquely
determined
by
—
the
collection
κ
(A)
⊆
O×μ
(A)}H
[where
H
ranges
over
the
open

{IH

Here,
we
remark
that
the
primary
justiﬁcation
for
this

lies
in
the
uniqueness
of

discussed
in

above.
(iv)
Let
‡
F
be

in

w

Thus,
‡

is
a
split

Let

Write
‡
G
=
Aut(‡

[so
‡
G
is
a
proﬁnite
group
isomorphic
to

Then
the
image
of
the
splitting
with
which
‡
Fw
is
equipped
determines
a
submonoid
def
O⊥
(‡

⊆

Write

O

Thus,
the

O×μ
(‡

and
O×μ

are
all

Next,
we

the
group-theoretic
algorithms
“G

and
“G
→
(G

discussed
in
Example
1.8,
(iii),
(iv).
If
we
apply
the
ﬁrst
of
these
algorithms
to

G,
then
it
follows
from
Remark
1.11.1,

that
there
exists
a

equipped

G-actions.
Moreover,
‡
κ×

induces
an
Ism-orbit
[cf.
Example
1.8,

of
isomorphisms
‡
×μ

i.e.,

The

a
splitting,
i.e.,
the
splitting
arising
from
the
deﬁnition
of

Thus,


Remark
4.10.1.
Strictly
speaking
[cf.
Remark
4.6.2,
(i)],
the
F

-prime-strips
constructed,
in
Corollary
4.10,
(ii),
from
the
theta
and
Gaussian
monoids
of
Corollary
4.6,

are
only
well-deﬁned
up
to
an
indeterminacy,
at
the
v

,
relative
to
automorphisms
of
the
split
Frobenioid
at
such
v
∈
Vbad
that
induce
the
identity
automorphism
on
the
associated
F
×
-prime-strip.
On
the
other
hand,
such
162
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
indeterminacies
may,
in
essence,
be
ignored,
since
they
are
“absorbed”
in
the
full
poly-isomorphisms
that
appear
in
the
Θ×μ
-
and
Θ×μ
gau
-links
of
Corollary
4.10,
(iii).
Remark
4.10.2.
(i)
Although
both
the
Θ×μ
-
and
Θ×μ
gau
-links
are
treated,
in
essence,
on
an
equal
footing
in
Corollary
4.10,
in
the
remainder
of
the
present
series
of
papers,
we
shall
ultimately
mainly
be
interested
in
[a
further
enhanced
version
of]
the
Θ×μ
gau
×μ
link.
On
the
other
hand,
the
signiﬁcance
of
the
Θ
-link
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
is
precisely
by
thinking
of
[a
further
enhanced
version
of]
the
Θ×μ
gau
-link
as
an
object
that
is
constructed
as
the
composite
of
the
Θ×μ
-link
with
the
operation
of
Galois
evaluation
that
one
may
establish
the
crucial
multiradiality
properties
discussed
in
[IUTchIII],
Theorem
3.11.
(ii)
At
v
∈
Vbad
,
the
Θ×μ
-link
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
equivalence
between
the
split
theta
monoids
of
Proposition
3.1,
(i)
[cf.
also
Corollary
1.12,
(ii)]
and
certain
submonoids
of
the
constant
monoids
of
Proposition
3.1,
(ii),
equipped
with
the
splittings
that
arise
from
the
q-parameter
“q
”
[cf.
the
discussion
of
“τv
”
v
in
[IUTchI],
Example
3.2,
(iv)].
On
the
other
hand,
it
is
important
to
note
in
this
context
that
unlike
the
case
with
the
splittings
that
occur
in
the
case
of
the
theta
monoids,
the
splittings
that
occur
in
the
case
of
the
constant
monoids
do
not
arise
from
the
operation
of
Galois
evaluation
—
i.e.,
from
a
splitting
“H
→
Gv
”
at
the
level
of
Galois
groups
of
some
surjection
Gv

H.
In
particular,
the
splittings
in
the
case
of
the
constant
monoids
do
not
admit
a
natural
multiradial
formulation
[cf.
Remark
1.11.5;
Proposition
3.4,
(ii)],
as
in
the
case
of
the
theta
monoids
[cf.
Corollary
1.12,
(iii)],
that
allows
one
to
decouple
the
monoids
into
“purely
radial”
and
“purely
coric”
components
[cf.
discussion
of
Remarks
1.11.4,
(i);
1.12.2,
(vi)].
Remark
4.10.3.
(i)
The
“coricity
of
F
×μ
-prime-strips”
†
×μ
F
∼
→
‡
×μ
F
discussed
in
Corollary
4.10,
(iv),
amounts,
in
essence,
to
the
“coricity
of
D
-prime∼
strips”
†
D
→
‡
D
[cf.
Corollary
4.10,
(iv)],
together
with
the
“coricity
of
[various
quotients
by
torsion
of
]
the
units
O×
(−)”
of
the
Frobenioids
involved
—
cf.
[IUTchI],
Corollary
3.7,
(ii),
(iii).
In
[IUTchIII],
this
coricity
of
the
units
will
play
a
central
role
when
we
apply
the
theory
of
the
log-wall
[cf.
[AbsTopIII]].
In
particular,
this
coricity
of
the
units
will
allow
us
to
compare
volumes
on
either
side
of
the
Θ×μ
-,
Θ×μ
gau
-links.
(ii)
Unlike
the
units
[cf.
the
discussion
of
(i)!],
the
“divisor
monoid”,
or
“value
group”,
portion
of
the
Frobenioids
involved
is
by
no
means
preserved
by
the
Θ×μ
-,
×μ
-,
Θ×μ
Θ×μ
gau
-links!
Indeed,
this
“value
group”
portion
of
the
Θ
gau
-links
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“Frobenius
morphism”
—
cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
3.6.2,
(iii),
as
well
as
Remark
4.11.1
below.
Alternatively,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
analogy
between
[complex
or
p-adic]
Teichmüller
theory
and
the
theory
of
INTER-UNIVERSAL
TEICHMÜLLER
THEORY
II
163
the
present
series
of
papers,
this
portion
of
the
Θ×μ
-,
Θ×μ
gau
-links
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
Teichmüller
deformation
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],
Remark
3.9.3,
(ii)].
Indeed,
the
computation
of
the
“volume
distortion”
arising
from
this
“arithmetic
Teichmüller
deformation”
may,
in
some
sense,
be
regarded
as
the
ultimate
goal
of
the
present
series
of
papers.
(iii)
In
the
context
of
the
discussion
of
(ii),
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
if
one
restricts
the
value
group
portion
of
the
Θ×μ
gau
-link
—
i.e.,

2

q
→
qj

v
v
1≤j≤l
[cf.
Remark
3.6.2,
(iii)]
—
to
the
label
j
=
1,
then
the
resulting
correspondence
q
→
v
q
v
may
be
naturally
identiﬁed
with
the
“identity”
—
cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
3.6.2,
(iii).
Put
another
way,
the
restriction
to
the
label
j
=
1
of
the
Gaussian
distribution
may
be
identiﬁed,
for
instance
at
the
level
of
realiﬁcations,
with
the
pivotal
distribution
discussed
in
[IUTchI],
Example
5.4,
(vii).
On
the
other
hand,
in
this
context,
it
is
important
to
observe
that
the
operation
of
restriction
to
various
proper
subsets
of
the
set
of
all
labels
|Fl
|
fails,
in
general,
to
be

[cf.
the
situation
discussed
in
[IUTchI],
Remark
3.9.1]
—
of
the
above
inﬁnite
chain.
(ii)
If
we
regard
each
of
the
D-Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theaters
of
the
chain
of
(i)
as
a
spoke
emanating
from
the
mono-analytic
core
“(−)

discussed
in
(i),
then
we
obtain
a
diagram
—
i.e.,
an

as
in
Fig.
4.3
above
[cf.
the
situation
discussed
in
[IUTchI],
Corollaries
4.12,
6.10].
Thus,
each
spoke
may
be
thought
of
as
a
distinct
“arithmetic
holomorphic
structure”
on
the
mono-analytic
core.
Finally,
[cf.
the
situation
discussed
in
[IUTchI],
Corollaries
4.12,
6.10]
this
diagram
satisﬁes
the
important
property
of

arbitrary
permutation
symmetries
among
the

[i.e.,
the
labels
n

Z
of
the
D-Θ±ell
NF-Hodge

(iii)
The
constructions
of
(i)
and
(ii)
are
compatible,
in
the
evident
sense,
with
the
constructions
of
[IUTchI],
Corollaries

to

In
this
context,
it
is
useful
to
recall
the
analogy
between
the
classical
Gaussian
integral
and
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers
[cf.
Remark
1.12.5]
—
an
analogy
in
which
the
“order-conscious”
Frobenius-picture
corresponds
to
the
cartesian
coordinate
representation
of
the
Gaussian
integral,
while
the
“permutationsymmetric”
étale-picture
corresponds
to
the
polar
coordinate
representation
of
the
Gaussian
integral.
Finally,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
discussion
of
Remark

4.7.4,
the
l-torsion
that
occurs
as
the
index
set
of
the
various
“q
j
’s”
that
appear
in
the
Gaussian
monoid
of
each
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theater
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
multiradial
combinatorial
representation
of
the
distinct
“arithmetic
holomorphic
structures”
corresponding
to
the
various
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theaters.
Remark
4.11.2.
At
this
point,
we
pause
to
review
the
theory
developed
so
far
in
the
present
series
of
papers.
(i)
The
notion
of
a
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theater
[cf.
[IUTchI],
Deﬁnition
6.13,
(i)]
is
intended
as
a
model
of
conventional
scheme-theoretic
arithmetic
geometry
—
i.e.,
more
precisely,
of
the
conventional
scheme-theoretic
arithmetic
geometry
surrounding
the
theta
function
at
primes
of
bad
reduction
∈
Vbad
of
the
elliptic
curve
over
a
number
ﬁeld
under
consideration.
At
a
more
technical
level,
a
Θ±ell
NFHodge
theater
may
be
thought
of
as
an
apparatus
that
allows
one
to
construct
a
sort
of
bridge
between
the
number
ﬁeld
and
theta
functions
[at
v
∈
Vbad
]
under
consideration.
From
a
more
concrete
point
of
view,
this
bridge
is
realized
by
the
Gaussian
distribution
—
i.e.,
a
globalized
version
of
the
theta
values

qj
2
v

1≤j≤l
at
l-torsion
points
[cf.
Remark
3.6.2,
(iii)].
Here,
we
remark
that
the
term
“Gaussian
distribution”
is
intended
as
an
intuitive
expression
that
includes
the
more
technical
notions
of
“Gaussian
monoids”
and
“Gaussian
Frobenioids”.
The
Gaussian
distribution
also
plays
the
crucial
role
of
allowing
the
construction
of
the
[non±ell
NF-Hodge
theaters
[cf.
scheme/ring-theoretic!]
Θ×μ
gau
-link
between
distinct
Θ
Corollary
4.10,
(iii)]
—
i.e.,
between
distinct
models
of
conventional
schemetheoretic
arithmetic
geometry.
(ii)
Within
a
single
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theater,
the
theory
of
étale
and
Frobenioidtheoretic
theta
functions
developed
in
[EtTh]
is
applied
to
construct
a
single
connected
geometric
“Kummer
theory-compatible
theater
for
evaluation
of
the
theta
function”,
whose
étale-theoretic
realization
admits
a
multiradial
formulation
[cf.
the
theory
of
§1,
especially
Corollary
1.12],
and
whose
connectedness
allows
one
to
establish
conjugate
synchronization
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
2.6.1]
166
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
between
the
various
copies
of
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
the
base
ﬁeld
at
the
various
l-torsion
points
at
which
the
theta
function
is
evaluated.
Moreover,
this
conjugate
synchronization
satisﬁes
the
crucial
property
of
compatibility
with
the
F±
l
-symmetry
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
3.5.2,
as
well
as
Corollaries
4.5,
(iii);
4.6,
(iii)]
of
the
underlying
D-Θell
-bridge
[cf.
[IUTchI],
Proposition
6.8,
(i)]
of
the
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theater
under
consideration.
Conjugate
synchronization
plays
an
essential
role
in
establishing
the
coricity
of
the
units
[cf.
Corollary
4.10,
(iv)]
in
a
fashion
which
is
compatible
with
both
the
étale-theoretic
—
i.e.,
“anabelian”
—
and
abstract
monoid/Frobenioid-theoretic
—
i.e.,
“post-anabelian”
—
representations
of
the
Gaussian
monoids
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
3.8.3].
Here,
we
recall
that
the
“post-anabelian”
representation
of
the
Gaussian
monoids
is
necessary
to
construct
the
Θ×μ
gau
-link
of
Corollary
4.10,
(iii)
[cf.
Remarks
3.6.2,
(ii);
3.8.3,
(i)].
On
the
other
hand,
the
“anabelian”
representation
of
the
Gaussian
monoids
will
play
an
essential
role
when
we
apply
the
theory
of
the
log-wall
[cf.
[AbsTopIII]]
in
[IUTchIII]
[cf.
Remark
3.8.3,
(ii)].
Another
important
aspect
of
the
theory
of
Gaussian
distibutions,
at
v
∈
Vbad
,
is
the
canonical
splittings
of
the
monoids
involved
into
“unit”
and
“value
group”
components.
These
splittings
may
be
thought
of,
in
the
context
of
the
Θ×μ
gau
-link,
as
corresponding
to
the
“nondeformed”
[cf.
the
“coricity
of
the
units”]
and
“Teichmüller-dilated”
[cf.
the
“value
group”
portion
of
the
Gaussian
distribution]
real
dimensions
that
appear
in
classical
complex
Teichmüller
theory
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
4.10.3,
(i),
(ii)].
Finally,
these
splittings
will
play
a
crucial
role
in
the
theory
of
log-shells
[cf.
[AbsTopIII]],
which
we
shall
apply
in
[IUTchIII].
(iii)
By
contrast,
the
number
ﬁelds
that
appear
in
the
underlying
ΘNFHodge
theater
of
the
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theater
under
consideration
[cf.
the
theory
of
[IUTchI],
§5]
will
ultimately,
in
[IUTchIII],
in
the
context
of
log-shells,
play
the
role
of
relating
—
via
the
ring
structure
of
these
number
ﬁelds
—
-line
bundles
[i.e.,
“idèlic”
or
“Frobenioid-theoretic”
line
bundles]
to
“
-line
bundles”
[i.e.,
line
bundles
thought
of
as
modules]
—
cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
4.7.2.
Such
relationships
are
only
possible
if
one
considers
all
of
the
primes
of
the
number
ﬁelds
involved
[cf.
[AbsTopIII],
Remark
5.10.2,
(iv)].
Constructions
associated
to
these
number
ﬁelds
satisfy
the
property
of
being
compatible
with
the
F
l
-symmetry
[cf.
[IUTchI],
Proposition
4.9,
(i)]
of
the
underlying
NF-bridge
of
the
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theater
under
consideration.
Unlike
the
F±
l
-symmetry
discussed
in
(ii),
which
is
combinatorially
uniradial
in
nature
and
may
be
thought
of,
in
the
context
of
the
splittings
discussed
in
(ii),
as
being
associated
with
the
“units”,
the
F
l
-symmetry
is
combinatorially
multiradial
in
nature
and
may
be
thought
of,
in
the
context
of
the
splittings
discussed
in
(ii),
as
being
associated
with
the
“value
groups”
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remarks
4.7.3,
4.7.4,
4.7.5].
On
the
other
hand,
[cf.
the
discussion
of
(ii)]
the
F±
l
-symmetry
satisﬁes
the
crucial
property
of
being
compatible
with
conjugate
synchronization
—
a
property
which
may
only
be
established
after
one
isolates
the
prime-strips
under
consideration
from
the
conjugacy
indeterminacies
inherent
in
the
global
structure
of
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
a
number
ﬁeld
[cf.
Remark
4.7.2].
Put
another
way,
conjugate
synchronization
may
only
be
established
once
the
prime-strips
under
consideration
are
treated
as
objects
which
are
free
of
any
combinatorial
constraints
arising
from
the
“prime-trees”
associated
to
a
number
ﬁeld
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],
Remark
4.3.1].
On
the
other

hand,
one
important
property
shared
by
both
the
F±
l
-
and
Fl
-symmetries
is
the
INTER-UNIVERSAL
TEICHMÜLLER
THEORY
II
167
connectedness
of
the
global
objects
that
appear
in
the
[Θell
-/NF-bridges
of]
these
symmetries.
This
connectedness
plays
an
essential
role
in
the
bookkeeping
operations
involving
the
labels
of
the
evaluation
points
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remarks
3.5.2
and
4.5.3,
(iii),
as
well
as
[IUTchI],
Remark
4.9.2,
(i)].
In
particular,
such
bookkeeping
operations
cannot
be
implemented
if,
for
instance,
instead
of
working
with
a
global
number
ﬁeld,
one
attempts
to
take
as
one’s
“global
objects”
formal
products
of
the
local
objects
at
the
various
primes
of
the
number
ﬁeld
under
consideration
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[AbsTopIII],
Remark
3.7.6,
(v)].
Finally,
we
recall
that
the
essential
role
played
by
these
“global
bookkeeping
operations”
gives
rise,
in
light
of
the
proﬁnite
nature
of
the
global
geometric
étale
fundamental
groups
involved,
to
a
situation
in
which
one
must
apply
the
“complements
on
tempered
coverings”
developed
in
[IUTchI],
§2
[cf.
Remark
4.5.3,
(iii)].
(iv)
One
way
to
summarize
the
above
discussion
is
as
follows.
The
bridge
constituted
by
the
Gaussian
distribution
of
a
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theater
between
theta
functions
and
number
ﬁelds
may
be
thought
of
as
being
constructed
by
dismantling
those
aspects
of
the
“characteristic
topography”
of
the
theta
functions
and
number
ﬁelds
involved
that
constitute
an
obstruction
to
relating
theta
functions
to
number
ﬁelds.
In
the
case
of
theta
functions,
the
main
obstruction
to
constructing
such
a
link
to
the
number
ﬁeld
under
consideration
is
constituted
by
the
geometric
dimension
of
the
tempered
coverings
of
elliptic
curves
[at
v
∈
Vbad
]
on
which
the
theta
functions
are
deﬁned.
This
obstruction
is
resolved
by
means
of
the
operation
of
evaluation
at
the
l-torsion
points.
Thus,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
schemetheoretic
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
of
[HASurI],
[HASurII],
one
may
think
of
these
l-torsion
points
as
a
sort
of
“rough
ﬁnite
approximation”
of
the
tempered
coverings
of
elliptic
curves
under
consideration
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[HASurI],
§1.3.4].
By
contrast,
in
the
case
of
number
ﬁelds,
the
main
obstruction
to
constructing
such
a
link
to
the
theta
functions
under
consideration
is
the
“prime-trees”
arising
from
the
global
structure
of
the
number
ﬁeld,
which
give
rise
to
the
conjugacy
indeterminacies
that
obstruct
the
establishment
of
conjugate
synchronization
[cf.
the
discussion
of
(iii)
above].
This
obstruction
is
resolved
by
dismantling
the
global
prime-tree
structure
of
the
number
ﬁelds
involved
by
working
with
various
prime-strips
labeled
by
elements
∈
F
l
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],
Remark
4.3.1].
Thus,
one
may
think
of
these
collections
of
prime-strips
labeled
by
elements
∈
F
l
as
“rough
ﬁnite
approximations”
of
the
inﬁnite
prime-trees
associated
to
the
number
ﬁelds
involved.
At
a
more
combinatorial
level
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
4.7.5],
this
dismantling
process
may
be
thought
of
as
the
process
of
dismantling
the
ring
structure
of
Fl
—
which
we
think
of
as
a
“rough
ﬁnite
approximation”
of
Z
[cf.
[IUTchI],
Remark
6.12.3,
(i)]
—
into
its
additive
and

multiplicative
components,
which
correspond,
respectively,
to
the
F±
l
-
and
Fl
symmetries.
Remark
4.11.3.
In
the
context
of
the
discussion
of
Remark
4.11.2,
it
is
interesting
to
observe
that,
whereas,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
combinatorics
of
the
F±
l

and
Fl
-symmetries,
one
has
correspondences
Θell
←→
,
NF
←→
—
i.e.,
the
Θell
-bridge
corresponds
to
the
additive
F±
l
-symmetry,
while
the
NF
bridge
corresponds
to
the
multiplicative
Fl
-symmetry
—
at
the
level
of
line
bundles,
168
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
one
has
correspondences
Θell
←→
,
NF
←→
—
i.e.,
the
arithmetic
line
bundles
under
consideration
are
treated
multiplicatively,
via
monoids
or
Frobenioids,
in
the
context
of
the
Θell
-bridge,
while
the
equivalence
of
such
-line
bundles
with
-line
bundles
may
only
be
realized
in
the
context
of
the
global
ring
structure
of
the
number
ﬁelds
associated,
via
the
theory
of
[IUTchI],
§5,
to
the
NF-bridge.
This
“juggling
of
and
”
is
reminiscent
of
the
theory
of
the
log-wall
developed
in
[AbsTopIII]
[cf.,
e.g.,
the
discussion
of
[AbsTopIII],
§I3]
and,
indeed,
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
combinatorial
counterpart
to
the
“juggling
of
and
”
that
occurs
in
the
theory
of
the
log-wall.
Remark
4.11.4.
(i)
From
the
point
of
view
of
scheme-theoretic
Hodge-Arakelov
theory,
the
ltorsion
points
of
an
elliptic
curve
may
be
thought
of
as
a
“rough
ﬁnite
approximation”
of
the
two
real
dimensions
of
the
underlying
real
analytic
manifold
of
a
one-dimensional
complex
torus
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[HASurI],
§1.3.4].
In
schemetheoretic
Hodge-Arakelov
theory,
one
considers
spaces
of
functions
on
these
l-torsion
points.
The
two
dimensions
mentioned
above
then
correspond
to
a
“holomorphic
dimension”
and
a
“one-dimensional
deformation
of
this
holomorphic
dimension”
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[HASurI],
§1.4.2].
In
the
context
of
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers,
we
work,
in
eﬀect,
with
an
elliptic
curve
which
is
isogenous
to
the
given
elliptic
curve
via
an
isogeny
of
degree
l
—
i.e.,
with
“X”
as
opposed
to
“X”
—
so
that
we
may
neglect
the
“holomorphic
dimension”
mentioned
above
and
concentrate
instead
on
the
deformations
of
this
“holomorphic
dimension”
[cf.
the
discussion
of
the
Introduction
to
[EtTh]].
In
particular,
the
various
possible
values
at
the
various
l-torsion
points
at
which
the
theta
function
is
evaluated
in
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers
may
be
thought
of
as
various
possible
deformations
of
the
holomorphic
structure,
while
the
speciﬁc
values
of
the
theta
function
may
be
thought
of
as
a
speciﬁc
deformation
of
the
holomorphic
structure.
Here,
we
note
that
the
parameter
“0
=
t
∈
LabCusp±
(−)”
that
indexes
these
values
—
which,
like
the
tangent
space
to
the
original
elliptic
curve,
is
linear
which
respect
to
the
group
structure
of
the
elliptic
curve
—
descends
naturally
[especially
in
the
context
of
ΘNF-Hodge
theater!]
to
the
parameter
“j
∈
F
l
”
—
which
may
be
thought
of
as
×
2
the
“square
(F×
)
”
of
F
,
hence,
like
the
square
of
the
tangent
space
of
the
elliptic
l
l
curve,
which
is
naturally
isomorphic
to
the
tangent
space
to
the
moduli
space
of
elliptic
curves
at
the
point
determined
by
the
elliptic
curve
in
question,
is
quadratic
in
its
dependence
on
the
linear
group
structure
of
the
elliptic
curve.
Finally,
this
point
of
view
concerning
the
values
of
the
theta
function
is
reminiscent
of
the
point
of
view
of
Remark
3.6.2,
(iii),
in
which
we
observe
that,
in
the
context
of
the
Θ×μ
gau
link,
these
values
of
the
theta
function
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“deformation
between
the
identity
and
a
Frobenius
morphism”.
The
theta
function
involved
may
then
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
continuous
version
[i.e.,
as
opposed
to
a
“rough
ﬁnite
approximation”]
of
such
a
deformation.
(ii)
From
the
point
of
view
of
the
analogy
between
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers
and
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
[cf.
[AbsTopIII],
§I5],
the
portion
of
INTER-UNIVERSAL
TEICHMÜLLER

That
is
to
say,
each

—
which
one
may
think
of
as
representing
the
conventional
scheme
theory
surrounding
the

equipped

—
corresponds
to

curve
in

characteristic
equipped
with

[cf.
the

of
[AbsTopIII],
§I5].
The
theta

that
give
rise
to
the

may
be
thought
of
as
specifying
the
speciﬁc
canonical

[cf.
the
discussion
of

that
gives
rise
to
this
“canonical
lifting”.
The
canonical
Frobenius
lifting
on
this
canonical
lifting
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
the
theory
to
be
developed
in
[IUTchIII].

cf.
the
discussion
of
[pTeich],
Introduction,
§1.3,
§1.7;
the
discussion
in
[HASurI],
§1.3,
§1.4,
of
the
relationship
between
such
canonical
indigenous
bundles
in
the
case
of
the
moduli
stack
of
elliptic
curves
and
the
scheme-theoretic
HodgeArakelov
theory
of
[HASurI],
[HASurII].
Put
another
way,
it
corresponds
to
the
passage
from
thinking
of
the
“canonical
lifting”
as
a
curve
equipped
with
the
MF
∇
object
constituted
by
a
canonical
Frobenius-invariant
indigenous
bundle
to
thinking
of
the
“canonical
lifting”
as
a
curve
equipped
with
a
canonical
Galois
representation,
i.e.,
a
canonical
crystalline
representation
[that
is
to
say,
a
representation
that
happens
to
arise
from
an
MF
∇
-object]
of
the
arithmetic
fundamental
group
of
the
generic
ﬁber
of
the
curve
into
P
GL2
(Zp
).
(iii)
The
analogy
between
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers
and
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
may
also
be
seen,
at
a
more
technical
level,
in
the
following
correspondences
between
various
aspects
of
the
theory
presented
thus
far
in
the
present
series
of
papers
and
various
aspects
of
the
theory
of
[CanLift],
§3
[cf.
also

(a)
The
discussion
of
(ii)
above
is
reminiscent
of
the
important
role
played
by
the
canonical
Galois
representation
in
the
absolute
p-adic
anabelian
theory
of
[CanLift],
§3
[cf.

of

In
light
of
the
important
role
played,
in
the
present
series
of
papers,
by
mono-theta-theoretic
cyclotomic
rigidity
[which
was
reviewed
in
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(ii);
Remark
1.1.1],
it
is
perhaps
of
interest
to
recall
[cf.
Remark
1.11.6]
the
important
role
played
by
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphisms
in
the
theory
of
[CanLift],
§3,
via
the
theory
of
[AbsAnab],
§2
[cf.,
especially,
[AbsAnab],
Lemmas
2.5,
2.6].
On
the
other
hand,
at
the
level
of
direct
correspondences
between
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers
and
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory,
it
is
perhaps
better
to
think
of
mono-theta-theoretic
cyclotomic
rigidity
as
corresponding
to
the
local
uniformizations
arising
from
the
canonical
indigenous
bundle
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
3.6.5,
(iii)].
(c)
The
important
role
played,
in
the
present
series
of
papers,
by
the
“two

constituted
by
the
F±
l

and
Fl

—
whose
two-dimensionality
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
the
two
real
dimensions
of
the
complex
upper
half-plane
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],
Remark
6.12.3,
(iii)]
—
is
reminiscent
of
the
important
role
played
in
the
theory
of
[CanLift],
§3,
in
eﬀect,
by
the
vanishing
of
the
zero-th
group
cohomology
module
H

(Ad(−))
of
the
canonical
Galois

associated

the

over
the
ordinary

and
at
the
supersingular
points
of
the
mod
p
representations
considered
in
[CanLift],
Lemma
3.2.
That
is
to
say,
the
F±

may
be
regarded
as
corresponding
to
the

Moreover,
the
“intuitive,

of

—
a

that

NF-Hodge
theaters
in
the

that
appeared
in
the
discussion
of

—
is
reminiscent
of
the
important
role
played
in
the
theory
of
[CanLift],
§3,
by
the
description
given
in
[CanLift],
Lemma
3.4,
of
the
ﬁrst
group
cohomology
module
H
1
(Ad(−))
of
the
canonical
Galois
representation
associated
to
the
canonical
indigenous
bundle
—
whose
“slope
−1
portion”
may
be
thought
of
as
governing
the
“links”
between
the
“mod
pn
”
and
“mod
pn+1
”
portions
of
the
canonical
Galois
representation,
as
it
is
considered
in
the
proof
of
[CanLift],
Lemma
3.5.
Here,
we
note
that
this
description
may
be
summarized,
in
eﬀect,
as
asserting
that
the
slope
−1
portion
in
question
is,
up
to
tensor
product
with
an
unramiﬁed
Galois
representation,
isomorphic
to
a
direct
product
of
3g
−
3
+
r
copies
of
Fp
(−1)
[where
the
“(−1)”
denotes
a
Tate
twist]
—
a
situation
that
is
reminiscent
of
the
l
synchronized
copies
of
cyclotomes
that
occur
in
the
context
of
the
evaluation
of
the
theta
function
considered
in
the
present
series
of
papers.
Moreover,
the
deformations
of
the
canonical
Galois
representation
parametrized
by
this
module
“H
1
(Ad(−))”
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding,
in
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers,
to
the
“independent
Aut(Gv
)-indeterminacies”
[i.e.,
for
v
∈
Vnon
]
that
occur
at
each
label
∈
F
l
when
one
consider
multiradial
representations
of
Gaussian
monoids
—
cf.
the
theory
of
[IUTchIII],
§3;
[IUTchIII],
Remark
3.12.4,
(iii).
[Here,
we
note
that,
in
fact,
the
various
“−1’s”
in
(d)
should
be
replaced
by
“1’s”
—
cf.
Remark
4.11.5
below.]
Finally,
we
observe,
with
regard
to
(d),
that
the
172
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
description
in
question
that
appears
in
[CanLift],
Lemma
3.4,
may
be
thought
of
as
a
reﬂection
of
the
ordinarity
[i.e.,
as
opposed
to
just
admissibility]
of
the
positive
characteristic
nilpotent
indigenous
bundle
under
consideration,
hence
is
reminiscent
of
the
discussion
of
[AbsTopIII],
Remark
5.10.3,
(ii),
of
the
correspondence
between
ordinarity
in
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
and
the
theory
of
the
étale
theta
function
developed
in
[EtTh].
Remark
4.11.5.
We
take
this
opportunity
to
correct
a
few
notational
errors
in
the
statement
of
the
condition
(†M
)
of
[CanLift],
Lemma
3.4,
which,
however,
do
not
aﬀect
the
proof
of
this
lemma
in
any
substantive
way.
The
subquotient
“G2
(M
)”
(respectively,
“G−1
”)
should
have
been
denoted
“G−2
(M
)”
(respectively,
“G1
”).
The
subquotient
G−2
(M
)
(respectively,
G1
)
is
isomorphic
to
the
tensor
product
of
an
unramiﬁed
module
with
a
Tate
twist
Fp
(−2)
(respectively,
Fp
(1)).
That
is
to
say,
there
is
a
sign
error
in
the
Tate
twists
stated
in
(†M
).
Finally,
in
order
to
obtain
the
desired
dimensions
over
Fp
,
one
must
replace
the
cohomology
module
def
“M
=
H
1
(ΔX
log
,
Ad(VFp
))”
by
the
submodule
of
this
module
consisting
of
elements
whose
restriction
to
each
of
the
cuspidal
inertia
groups
of
ΔX
log
is
upper
triangular
with
respect
to
the
ﬁltration
determined
by
the
nilpotent
monodromy
action
on
VFp
[i.e.,
by
the
cuspidal
inertia
group
in
question].
That
is
to
say,
an
elementary
computation
shows
that
the
operation
of
restriction
to
this
submodule
has
the
eﬀect
of
lowering
the
dimension
of
G−2
(M
)
from
3g
−
3
+
2r
to
3g
−
3
+
r,
as
desired.
