Abstract
Inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory
may
be
described
as
a
sort
of
arithmetic
version
of
Teichmüller
theory
that
concerns
a
certain
type
of
canonical
deformation
associated
to
an
elliptic
curve
over
a
number
ﬁeld
and
a
prime
number
l
≥
5.
We
begin
our
survey
of
interuniversal
Teichmüller
theory
with
a
review
of
the
technical
diﬃculties
that
arise
in
applying
scheme-theoretic
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
to
diophantine
geometry.
It
is
precisely
the
goal
of
overcoming
these
technical
diﬃculties
that
motivated
the
author
to
construct
the
nonscheme-theoretic
deformations
that
form
the
content
of
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory.
Next,
we
discuss
generalities
concerning
“Teichmüller-theoretic
deformations”
of
various
familiar
geometric
and
arithmetic
objects
which
at
ﬁrst
glance
appear
one-dimensional,
but
in
fact
have
two
underlying
dimensions.
We
then
proceed
to
discuss
in
some
detail
the
various
components
of
the
log-theta-lattice,
which
forms
the
central
stage
for
the
various
constructions
of
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory.
Many
of
these
constructions
may
be
understood
to
a
certain
extent
by
considering
the
analogy
of
these
constructions
with
such
classical
results
as
Jacobi’s
identity
for
the
theta
function
and
the
integral
of
the
Gaussian
distribution
over
the
real
line.
We
then
discuss
the
“inter-universal”
aspects
of
the
theory,
which
lead
naturally
to
the
introduction
of
anabelian
techniques.
Finally,
we
summarize
the
main
abstract
theoretic
and
diophantine
consequences
of
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory,
which
include
a
veriﬁcation
of
the
ABC/Szpiro
Conjecture.

§

Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic
Motivation
The
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory
developed
in
[IUTchI],
[IUTchII],
[IUTchIII],
[IUTchIV]
arose
from
attempts
by
the
author,
which
began
around
the
summer
of
2000,
to
overcome
certain
technical
obstructions
in
the
scheme-theoretic
HodgeArakelov
theory
of
[HASurI],
[HASurII]
to
applying
this
theory
to
diophantine
geometry
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[HASurI],
§1.5.1;
[HASurII],
Remark
3.7;
[IUTchI],
Remark
4.3.1].
Thus,
we
begin
our
overview
of
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory
with
a
brief
review
of
the
essential
content
of
those
aspects
of
scheme-theoretic
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
that
are
relevant
to
the
development
of
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory.
Let
l
be
a
prime
number.
Then
we
recall
that
the
module
E[l]
of
l-torsion
points
def
of
a
Tate
curve
E
=
Gm
/q
Z
[over,
say,
a
p-adic
ﬁeld
or
the
complex
ﬁeld
C],
whose
q-parameter
we
denote
by
q,
ﬁts
into
a
natural
exact
sequence
0
−→
μl
−→
E[l]
−→
Z/lZ
−→
0.
That
is
to
say,
one
has
canonical
objects
as
follows:
a
“multiplicative
subspace”
μl
⊆
E[l]
and
“generators”
±1
∈
Z/lZ.
In
the
following
discussion,
we
ﬁx
an
elliptic
curve
E
over
a
number
ﬁeld
F
and
a
prime
number
l
≥
5.
For
convenience,
we
shall
use
the
notation
l
=
def
l−1
2
.
Also,
we
suppose
that
E
has
stable
reduction
at
all
nonarchimedean
primes
of
F
.
Then,
in
general,
the
module
E[l]
[i.e.,
more
precisely,
the
ﬁnite
étale
group
scheme
over
F
]
of
l-torsion
points
of
E
does
not
admit
a
“global
multiplicative
subspace”
or
“global
canonical
generators”
—
i.e.,
a
rank
one
submodule
M
⊆
E[l]
or
a
pair
of
generators
of
the
quotient
E[l]/M
that
coincide
with
the
above
canonical
multiplicative
subspace
and
generators
at
all
nonarchimedean
primes
of
F
where
E
has
bad
multiplicative
reduction.
Nevertheless,
let
us
suppose
that
such
global
objects
do
in
fact
exist!
Also,
let
us
write
K
def
=
F
(E[l])
for
the
extension
ﬁeld
of
F
generated
by
the
ﬁelds
of
deﬁnition
of
the
l-torsion
points
of
E,
V(K)
for
the
set
of
[archimedean
and
nonarchimedean]
valuations
of
K,
and
A

V(K)bad
⊆
V(K)
for
the
set
of
nonarchimedean
valuations
where
E
has
bad
multiplicative
reduction.
For
v
∈
V(K),
we
shall
write
Kv
for
the
completion
of
K
at
v,
Ov
⊆
Kv
for
the
subset
of
elements
f
∈
Kv
such
that
|f
|v
≤
1,
and
mv
⊆
Ov
for
the
subset
of
elements
f
∈
Kv
such
that
|f
|v
<
1.
Let
N
⊆
E[l]
be
a
rank
one
submodule
such
that
the
natural
morphism
of
ﬁnite
group
schemes
over
F
∼
→
M
×
N
E[l]
is
an
isomorphism.
Then
the
Fundamental
Theorem
of
Hodge-Arakelov
Theory
may
be
formulated
as
follows
[cf.
[HASurI],
§1;
[HASurII],
§1,
§3;
the
explicit
series
representation
of
the
theta
function
on
a

curve

in
[EtTh],

1.1.
(“Idealized”
Version
of
Fundamental
Theorem
of
HodgeArakelov

We
maintain
the
notation
of
the
above
discussion.
In
particular,
we
assume
the
existence
of
a
global
multiplicative
subspace
and
global
canonical
def
generators
[as
described
above]
for
E[l].
Write
∗
E

of

admits
a

ﬁltration
F

,
for
i
∈

given
by
the
sections
of

admit

⊗K
F
0
—
where
we
write
ω∗
E
for
the
cotangent
space
at
the
origin
of
∗
E.
The
codomain
of
the
isomorphism
(∗HA
)
admits
a
natural
Galois
action,
i.e.,
an
action
by
Gal(K/F
).
Finally,
this
isomorphism
(∗HA
)
of
K-vector
spaces
is
in
fact
compatible,
up
to
relatively
mild
discrepancies,
with
the
natural
integral
structures
(respectively,
metrics)
at
nonarchimedean
(respectively,
archimedean)
elements
of
V(K);
here,
the
integral
structure
of
the
codomain
at
nonarchimedean
v
∈
V(K)
is
as
described
above.
Over
the
complement
in
Spec(OK
)
of
V(K)bad
,
as
well
as
at
the
archimedean
primes
of
K,
the
content
of
Theorem
1.1
is
essentially
equivalent
to
the
content
of
the
[“non-idealized”]
Fundamental
Theorem
of
Hodge-Arakelov
Theory
given
in
[HASurI],
Theorem
A;
[HASurII],
Theorem
1.1
[cf.
the
discussion
preceding
[HASurII],
Deﬁnition
3.1]
—
i.e.,
“non-idealized”
in
the
sense
that
it
holds
even
in
the
absence
of
the
assumption
of
the
existence
of
the
global
multiplicative
subspace
and
global
canonical
generators.
On
the
other
hand,
the
portion
of
Theorem
1.1
that
concerns
the
integral
structures
at
the
valuations
∈
V(K)bad
follows
immediately
[i.e.,
in
light
of
the
theory
reviewed
in
[HASurI],
§1]
from
the
explicit
series
representation
of
the
theta
function
on
a
Tate
curve
given
in
[EtTh],
Proposition
1.4.
One
way
to
understand
[both
the
“idealized”
and
“non-idealized”
versions
of]
the
Fundamental
Theorem
of
Hodge-Arakelov
Theory
is
as
a
sort
of
scheme-theoretic
version
of
the
classical
computation
of
the
Gaussian
integral

∞
√
2
e−x
dx
=
π
−∞
by
applying
a
coordinate
transformation
from
cartesian
to
polar
coordinates
—
cf.
2
the
discussion
of
[IUTchII],
Remark
1.12.5,
(i).
Indeed,
the
function
“j
→
q
j
”
—
which
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
discrete
version
of
the
Gaussian
distribution
“e−x
”
—
appears
quite
explicitly
in
the
codomain
of
the
isomorphism
(∗HA
)
of
Theorem
1.1.
On
√
the
other
hand,
the
value
“
π”
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
the
[negative]
tensor
powers
of
the
sheaf
“ω”
that
arise
in
the
subquotients
of
the
Hodge
ﬁltration
that
appear
in
the
domain
of
this
isomorphism.
Indeed,
if,
in
the
domain
of
this
isomorphism,
one
omits
the
restriction
“<
l”,
then
one
obtains
a
natural
crystal
—
cf.
the
theory
of
the
“crystalline
theta
object”
discussed
in
[HASurII],
§2.
Unlike
the
crystals
that
typically
arise
in
the
case
of
the
de
Rham
cohomology
associated
to
a
family
of
varieties,
which
satisfy
the
property
of
Griﬃths
transversality,
this
crystal
exhibits
a
property
that
we
refer
to
as
Griﬃths
semi-transversality
[cf.
[HASurII],
Theorem
2
A
Panoramic
Overview
of
Inter-universal
Teichmüller
Theory
5
2.8],
i.e.,
the
crystal
corresponds
to
a
connection
whose
application
has
the
eﬀect
of
shifting
the
Hodge
ﬁltration
[not
by
one,
but
rather]
by
two
steps!
This
property
of
Griﬃths
semi-transversality
gives
rise
to
a
Kodaira-Spencer
isomorphism
[cf.
[HASurII],
Theorem
2.10]
between
ω
⊗2
and
the
restriction
via
the
classifying
morphism
associated
to
the
elliptic
curve
under
consideration
of
the
sheaf
of
logarithmic
diﬀerentials
on
the
moduli
stack
of
elliptic
curves
—
i.e.,
in
eﬀect,
between
ω
and
the
“square
root”
of
this
sheaf
of
logarithmic
diﬀerentials.
Here,
it
is
useful
to
recall
that
this
sheaf
of
logarithmic
diﬀerentials
admits
a
canonical
generator
in
a
neighborhood
of
the
cusp
at
inﬁnity
of
the
moduli
stack
of
elliptic
curves,
namely,
the
logarithmic
diﬀerential
q
−1
·dq
of
the
q-parameter,
which,
if
one
thinks
in
terms
of
the
classical
complex
theory
and
integrates
this
logarithmic
diﬀerential
once
over
a
loop
surrounding
the
cusp
at
inﬁnity,
has
an
associated
period
equal
to
2π.
This
provides
the
justiﬁcation
for
thinking
of
√
“ω”
as
corresponding
to
“
π”.
Finally,
we
recall
that
this
relationship
between
the
Fundamental
Theorem
of
Hodge-Arakelov
Theory
and
the
classical
Gaussian
integral
may
be
seen
more
explicitly,
via
the
classical
theory
of
Hermite
polynomials,
when
this
theory
is
restricted
to
the
archimedean
primes
of
a
number
ﬁeld
via
the
“Hermite
model”
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[HASurI],
§1.1].
In
this
context,
it
is
also
of
interest
to
note
that
unlike
many
aspects
of
the
classical
theory
of
theta
functions,
the
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
discussed
in
[HASurI],
[HASurII]
does
not
admit
a
natural
generalization
to
the
case
of
higher-dimensional
abelian
varieties
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[HASurI],
§1.5.2].
This
is
perhaps
not
so
surprising
in
light
of
the
analogy
discussed
above
with
the
classical
computation
of
the
Gaussian
integral
reviewed
above,
which
does
not
admit,
at
least
in
any
immediate,
naive
sense,
a
generalization
to
higher
dimension.
This
phenomenon
of
a
lack
of
any
immediate
generalization
to
higher
dimension
may
also
be
seen
in
the
theory
of
the
étale
theta
function
developed
in
[EtTh],
which
plays
a
central
role
in
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory.
In
the
case
of
the
étale
theta
function,
this
phenomenon
is
essentially
a
reﬂection
of
the
fact
that,
unlike
the
case
with
the
complement
of
an
ample
divisor
in
an
abelian
variety
of
arbitrary
dimension,
the
complement
of
the
origin
in
an
elliptic
curve
may
be
regarded
as
a
hyperbolic
curve,
i.e.,
as
an
object
for
which
there
exists
an
extensive
and
well-developed
theory
of
anabelian
geometry,
which
may
be
[and
indeed
is,
in
[EtTh]]
applied
to
obtain
various
important
rigidity
properties
involving
the
étale
theta
function
[cf.
the
discussion
of
the
Introduction
to
[EtTh]].
As
discussed
in
[HASurI],
Theorem
A,
the
isomorphism
of
Theorem
1.1
may
be
considered
over
the
moduli
stack
of
elliptic
curves
Mell
over
Z.
Indeed,
as
discussed
in
[HASurI],
§1,
a
proof
of
the
characteristic
zero
portion
of
the
isomorphism
of
Theorem
1.1
[or
[HASurI],
Theorem
A]
may
be
given
by
considering
the
corresponding
def
map
between
vector
bundles
of
rank
l
over
(Mell
)Q
=
Mell
×Z
Q:
That
is
to
say,
an
Shinichi
Mochizuki
6
easy
explicit
computation
involving
the
explicit
series
representation
of
the
theta
function
on
a
Tate
curve
[cf.,
e.g.,
[EtTh],
Proposition
1.4]
shows
that
this
map
between
vector
bundles
on
(Mell
)Q
is
an
isomorphism
at
the
generic
point
of
(Mell
)Q
.
Then
one
concludes
that
this
map
between
vector
bundles
is
in
fact
an
isomorphism
on
(Mell
)Q
by
computing
the
degrees
of
the
domain
and
codomain
of
the
map
under
consideration
and
observing
that
these
two
degrees
coincide.
Although
the
precise
computation
of
these
degrees
is
rather
involved,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
present
discussion
it
suﬃces
to
observe
that
the
highest
order
portions
of
the
average
degrees
[i.e.,
where
by
“average”,
we
mean
the
result
of
dividing
by
the
rank
l]
of
the
domain
[i.e.,
“LHS”]
and
codomain
[i.e.,
“RHS”]
vector
bundles
on
(Mell
)Q
of
the
map
under
consideration
coincide:

]
for
the
degree
on
(Mell
)Q
of
the
line
bundle
ωE
[i.e.,
the
line
bundle
determined
by
the
relative
cotangent
bundle
at
the
origin
of
the
tautological
semi-abelian
scheme
over
(Mell
)Q
];
we
write
[log(q)]
for
the
degree
on
(Mell
)Q
of
the
divisor
at
inﬁnity
of
(Mell
)Q
;
we
recall
the
elementary
fact
[a
consequence
of
the
existence
of
the
modular
form
typically
referred
to
as
the
“discrimant”]
that
[log(q)]
=
12
·
[ωE
].
In
this
context,
we
remark
that
the
line
bundle
F
0
[i.e.,
the
line
bundle
on
(Mell
)Q
that
corresponds
to
the
line
bundle
denoted
“F
0
”
in
Theorem
1.1]
is
“suﬃciently
small”
that
it
may
be
ignored,
i.e.,
from
the
point
of
view
of
computing
portions
of
highest
order.
Now
let
us
return
to
considering
arithmetic
vector
bundles
on
Spec(OK
)
in
the
context
of
Theorem
1.1.
The
Hodge
ﬁltration
F
−i
is
not
compatible
with
the
direct
sum
decomposition
of
the
codomain
of
the
isomorphism
(∗HA
)
of
Theorem
1.1.
This
fact
may
be
derived,
for
instance,
from
the
explicit
series
representation
of
the
theta
function
on
a
Tate
curve
[cf.,
e.g.,
[EtTh],
Proposition
1.4]
and
is
closely
related
to
the
theory
of
the
arithmetic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
arising
from
this
isomorphism
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[HASurII],
§3,
especially,
[HASurII],
Corollary
3.6].
In
particular,
it
follows
that,
for
most
j,
by
projecting
to
the
factor
labeled
j
of
this
direct
sum
decomposition,
one
may
construct
a
[nonzero!]
morphism
of
arithmetic
line
bundles
[i.e.,
of
rank
one
K-vector
spaces
that
is
compatible
“from
below”
with
the
integral
structures
at
nonarchimedean
primes
and
the
metrics
at
archimedean
primes
—

e.g.,

discussion
of
[GenEll],
§1]

—
where
we
remark
that,
from
the
point
of
view
of
computations
to
highest
order,
one
may
think
of
the
arithmetic
line
bundle
corresponding
to
F
0
as
being,
essentially

the
trivial
arithmetic
line
bundle,
and
one
may
ignore
the
“relatively
mild
discrepancies”
referred
to
in
Theorem
1.1.
Such
a
nonzero
morphism
of
arithmetic
line
bundles
implies
an
inequality
between
arithmetic
degrees
“degarith
(−)”
of
arithmetic
line
bundles,
i.e.,
if
we
write
Ωlog
M
|E
for
the
arithmetic
line
bundle
on
Spec(OK
)
determined
by
restricting
the
line
bundle
of
logarithmic
diﬀerentials
on
Mell
[relative
to
the
log
structure
determined
by
the
divisor
at
inﬁnity]
via
the
classifying
morphism
associated
to
EK
,
then
1
6
·
degarith
(log(q))
=
htE
<
constant
def
—
where
we
write
htE
=
2
·
degarith
(ωE
)
=
degarith
(Ωlog
M
|E
)
for
the
canonical
height
of
the
elliptic
curve
EK
and
degarith
(log(q))
for
the
arithmetic
degree
of
the
arithmetic
divisor
on
Spec(OK
)
determined
by
restricting
the
divisor
at
inﬁnity
of
Mell
via
the
classifying
morphism
associated
to
EK
[cf.,
e.g.,
the
discussion
of
[GenEll],
§1,
§3].
Here,
the
arithmetic
degrees
are
to
be
understood
as
being
normalized
[i.e.,
by
dividing
by
the
degree
over
Q
of
the
number
ﬁeld
under
consideration
—
cf.
the
discussion
of
[GenEll],
§1]
so
as
to
be
invariant
with
respect
to
the
operation
of
passing
to
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
the
number
ﬁeld
under
consideration.
Before
proceeding,
we
pause
to
discuss
the
meaning
of
the
“constant”
that
appears
in
the
inequality
of
the
preceding
display.
First
of
all,
to
simplify
the
discussion,
we
assume
that
the
complex
moduli
of
the
elliptic
curve
EK
at
the
archimedean
primes
of
K
are
subject
to
the
restriction
that
they
are
only
allowed
to
vary
within
some
def
ﬁxed
compact
subset
of
(Mell
)C
=
(Mell
)
×Z
C
that
does
not
contain
the
divisor
at
inﬁnity.
It
follows
from
[GenEll],
Theorem
2.1,
that,
from
the
point
of
view
of
verifying
the
ABC
Conjecture,
this
does
not
result
in
any
essential
loss
of
generality.
Then
it
follows
from
the
discussion
of
the
“étale
integral
structure”
in
[HASurI],
§1
[cf.
also
[HASurI],
Theorem
A],
together
with
elementary
estimates
via
Stirling’s
formula,
that
this
“constant”
is
roughly
of
the
order
of
log(l).
In
particular,
if
[as
is
done,
for
instance,
in
[GenEll],
§4;
[IUTchIV],
§2]
one
assumes
that
l
is
roughly
of
the
order
of
htE
,
then,
by
possibly
enlarging
the
“constant”
of
the
inequality
under
consideration,
one
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
—
i.e.,
so
long
as
one
respects
the
restrictions
just
imposed
on
the
complex
moduli
and
the
size
of
l
relative
to
the
height!
—
that
this
constant
is,
in
fact,
independent
of
the
elliptic
curve
E,
the
number
ﬁeld
F
,
and
the
prime
number
l.
For
a
more
precise
statement,
we
refer
to
[GenEll],
Lemma
3.5,
where
an
inequality
is
derived
by
assuming,
in
eﬀect,
only
the
existence
of
a
global
multiplicative
subspace
[i.e.,
without
assuming
the
existence
of
global
canonical
generators!]
for
E[l];
moreover,
the
proof
of
[GenEll],
Lemma
3.5,
is
entirely
elementary
and
does
not
require
the
use
of
the
scheme-theoretic
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
surveyed
in
[HASurI],
[HASurII].
Thus,
one
8
Shinichi
Mochizuki
may
conclude
—
i.e.,
either
from
the
above
discussion
of
the
inequality
arising
from
Theorem
1.1
or
from
[the
argument
of]
[GenEll],
Lemma
3.5
—
that
if
one
bounds
the
degree
[F
:
Q]
of
the
number
ﬁeld
F
over
Q
and
the
complex
moduli
of
the
elliptic
curve
E
at
the
archimedean
primes
of
F
,
then
the
assumption
that
E[l]
admits
a
global
multiplicative
subspace
and
global
canonical
generators
[i.e.,
where,
in
fact,
the
latter
is
unnecessary,
if
one
applies
[the
argument
of]
[GenEll],
Lemma
3.5,
as
is
done,
for
instance,
in
the
proof
of
[IUTchIV],
Corollary
2.2,
(ii)]
implies
that
there
are
only
ﬁnitely
many
possibilities
for
the
j-invariant
of
E
[cf.
[GenEll],
Propositions
1.4,
(iv);
3.4].
[Here,
we
remark
in
passing
that
the
various
hypotheses
on
the
prime
l
that
appear
in
the
statement
of
[GenEll],
Lemma
3.5,
are
applied
only
to
conclude
that
the
cyclic
subgroup
under
consideration
is
“global
multiplicative”.
That
is
to
say,
if
one
assumes
from
the
start
that
this
cyclic
subgroup
is
“global
multiplicative”,
then
the
argument
of
the
proof
of
[GenEll],
Lemma
3.5,
may
be
applied
without
imposing
any
hypotheses
on
the
prime
l.]
In
this
context,
it
is
of
interest
to
consider
the
following
complex
analytic
analogue
of
the
above
discussion.
Let
ES
→
S
be
a
family
of
one-dimensional
semi-abelian
varieties
over
a
connected
smooth
proper
algebraic
curve
S
over
C
that
restricts
to
a
family
of
elliptic
curves
EU
→
U
over
some
nonempty
open
subscheme
U
⊆
S.
Write
EU
→
U
for
the
complex
analytic
family
of
complex
tori
determined
by
EU
→
U
.
Let
U
→
U
be
a
universal
covering
space
of
the
Riemann
surface
U
.
Then
the
classifying
morphism
of
the
family
EU
→
U
determines
a
holomorphic
map
φ
:
U
→
H
to
the
upper
half-plane
H
which
is
well-deﬁned
up
to
composition
with
an
automorphism
of
H
induced
by
the
well-known
action
of
SL2
(Z)
on
H.
Now
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
this
map
φ
:
U
→
H
is
either
constant
or
has
open
dense
image
in
H.
In
particular,
if
φ
is
nonconstant,
then
it
follows
that
every
point
in
the
boundary
∂H
of
H
[i.e.,
where
we
regard
H
as
being
embedded,
in
the
usual
way,
in
the
complex
projective
line
P1C
]
lies
in
the
closure
of
the
image
Im(φ)
of
φ.
On
the
other
hand,
the
natural
complex
analytic
analogue
of
the
condition
that
there
exist
a
global
multiplicative
subspace
in
the
sense
of
the
above
discussion
concerning
elliptic
curves
over
number
ﬁelds
may
be
formulated
as
follows:
The
local
system
on
U
in
rank
two
free
Z-modules
determined
by
the
[abelian!]
fundamental
groups
of
the
ﬁbers
of
EU
→
U
admits
a
rank
one
subspace
that
coincides
with
the
subspace
of
the
“complex
Tate
curve
Gm
/q
Z
”
determined
by
the
fundamental
group
of
Gm
in
every
suﬃciently
small
neighborhood
of
a
point
of
the
Riemann
suface
S
associated
to
S
where
the
family
EU
→
U
degenerates.
A
Panoramic

of

9
Moreover,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
this
condition
is
equivalent
to
the
condition
that
the
intersection
with
∂H
of
the
closure
of
Im(φ)
be
equal
to
a
single
cusp
[i.e.,
a
single
point
of
the
SL2
(Z)-orbit
of
the
point
at
inﬁnity
of
P1C
].
In
particular,
one
concludes
that
this
condition
can
only
hold
if
φ
is
constant,
i.e.,
if
the
original
family
of
elliptic
curves
EU
→
U
is
isotrivial.
Now
let
us
return
to
our
discussion
of
elliptic
curves
over
number
ﬁelds.
Then,
roughly
speaking,
the
above
discussion
may
be
summarized
as
follows:
The
assumption
of
the
existence
of
a
global
multiplicative
subspace
and
global
canonical
generators
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
arithmetic
analogue
of
the
geometric
notion
of
an
isotrivial
family
of
elliptic
curves
and,
moreover,
implies
bounds
on
the
height
of
the
elliptic
curve
under
consideration.
This
state
of
aﬀairs
motivates
the
following
question:
Is
it
possible
to
obtain
bounds
—
perhaps
weaker
in
some
suitable
sense!
—
on
the
height
of
arbitrary
elliptic
curves
over
number
ﬁelds,
i.e.,
without
assuming
the
existence
of
a
global
multiplicative
subspace
or
global
canonical
generators?
Put
another
way,
one
would
like
to
somehow
carry
out
the
above
derivation
of
bounds
on
the
height
from
the
isomorphism
(∗HA
)
of
Theorem
1.1
without
assuming
the
existence
of
a
global
multiplicative
subspace
or
global
canonical
generators.
As
discussed
in
[HASurI],
§1.5.1,
if
one
tries
to
carry
out
the
above
derivation
by
applying
the
“nonidealized”
version
of
Theorem
1.1
[i.e.,
which
holds
without
assuming
the
existence
of
a
global
multiplicative
subspace
or
global
canonical
generators!],
then
one
must
contend
with
“Gaussian
poles”
—
i.e.,
with
a
situation
in
which
the
critical
morphism
of
arithmetic
line
bundles
that
appears
in
the
above
discussion
has
poles
of
relatively
large
order!
—
which
have
the
eﬀect
of
rendering
the
resulting
inequality
essentially
vacuous.
That
is
to
say,
from
the
point
of
view
of
generalizing
the
derivation
of
bounds
on
the
height
given
above,
the
above
question
may
be
reinterpreted
as
follows:
Is
it
possible
to
somehow
reformulate
the
scheme-theoretic
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
of
[HASurI],
[HASurII]
in
such
a
way
that
one
may
circumvent
the
technical
obstruction
constituted
by
the
Gaussian
poles?
It
was
this
state
of
aﬀairs
that
motivated
the
author
in
the
summer
of
2000
to
initiate
the
development
of
the
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory
established
in
[IUTchI],
[IUTchII],
[IUTchIII],
[IUTchIV].
From
an
extremely
naive
point
of
view,
the
approach
that
underlies
the
development
of
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory
may
be
described
as
follows:
10
Shinichi
Mochizuki
Suppose
that
the
assignment

2
qj
j=1,...,l
→
q
(∗KEY
)
—
that
is
to
say,
for
each
valuation
v
∈
V(K)bad
,
one
considers
the
assignment
2
→
q
—
somehow
determines
an
automorphism
of
the
{q
j
}j=1,...,l
v
v
number
ﬁeld
K!
Before
proceeding,
we
remark
that
the
assignment
(∗KEY
)
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
tautological
solution
to
the
problem
discussed
above
of
resolving
the
technical
obstruction
constituted
by
the
Gaussian
poles
—
i.e.,
in
short,
the
problem
of
contending
with
the
absence
of
the
domain
of
the
assignment
(∗KEY
)
in
a
situation
in
which
the
presence
of
the
codomain
of
the
assignment
(∗KEY
)
may
be
taken
for
granted.
This
approach
may
seem
somewhat
far-fetched
at
ﬁrst
glance
but
is
in
fact
motivated
by
the
classical
analogy
between
number
ﬁelds
and
function
ﬁelds:
that
is
to
say,
if
one
thinks
of
a
typical
2l-th
root
of
a
q-parameter
q
as
being,
roughly
speakv
ing,
like
some
positive
power
of
a
prime
number
p,
and
one
thinks
of,
say,
the
rational
number
ﬁeld
Q
as
corresponding
to
the
one-dimensional
function
ﬁeld
Fp
(t),
i.e.,
so
p
corresponds
to
the
indeterminate
t,
then
the
assignment
(∗KEY
)
considered
above
corresponds,
roughly
speaking
[i.e.,
if
one
reverses
the
direction
of
“→”],
to
an
assignment
of
the
form
t
→
ta
for
some
positive
integer
a,
i.e.,
an
assignment
which
does
indeed
determine
a
homomorphism
of
ﬁelds
Fp
(t)
→
Fp
(t).
Also,
in
this
context,
it
is
of
interest
to
observe
that
the
proof
of
the
result
quoted
earlier
[i.e.,
[GenEll],
Lemma
3.5]
to
the
eﬀect
that
the
existence
of
a
global
multiplicative
subspace
implies
bounds
on
the
height
proceeds
precisely
by
observing
that
the
existence
of
a
global
multiplicative
subspace
implies
that
the
elliptic
curve
under
consideration
is
isogenous
to
—
i.e.,
in
eﬀect,
has
roughly
[that
is
to
say,
up
to
terms
of
relatively
negligible
order]
the
same
height
as
—
an
elliptic
curve
whose
q-parameters
are
precisely
the
l-th
powers
of
the
q-parameters
of
the
original
elliptic
curve
[cf.
the
application
of
[GenEll],
Lemma
3.2,
(ii),
in
the
proof
of
[GenEll],
Lemma
3.5]:
that
is
to
say,
in
short,
the
existence
of
a
global
multiplicative
subspace
implies
that
one
is
in
a
situation
that
is
invariant,
so
to
speak,
with
respect
to
the
transformation
“q
→
q
l
”!
As
discussed
in
the
introduction
to
[GenEll],
§3,
this
technique
is,
in
essence,
a
sort
of
miniature,
or
simpliﬁed,
version
of
a
technique
which
dates
back
to
Tate
for
proving
“Tate
conjecture-type
results”
and
may
be
seen,
for
instance,
in
Faltings’
work
on
the
Tate
conjecture.
At
any
rate,
if
one
assumes
that
one
has
such
an
automorphism
of
the
number
ﬁeld
K,
then
since
such
an
automorphism
necessarily
preserves
degrees
of
arithmetic

Panoramic

11
line
bundles,
it
follows
—
since
the
absolute
value
of
the
degree
of
the
RHS
of
the
assignment
(∗KEY
)
under
consideration
is
“small”
by
comparison
to
the
absolute
value
of
the
[average!]
degree
of
the
LHS
of
this
assignment
—
in
a
similar
fashion
to
the
discussion
of
the
derivation
of
a
bound
on
the
height
from
Theorem
1.1
that
a
similar
inequality,
i.e.,
a
bound
on
the
height
of
EK
,
holds:

Of
course,
needless
to
say,
such
automorphisms
of
number
ﬁelds
do
not
in
fact
exist!!
On
the
other
hand,
the
starting
point
of
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory
lies
in
adopting
the
following
point
of
view:
We
regard
the
“{q
j
}”
on
the
LHS
and
the
“q”
on
the
RHS
of
the
assignment

distinct
copies
of
“conventional
ring/scheme
theory”,
i.e.,
“distinct
arithmetic
holomorphic
structures”,
and
we
think
of
the
assignment
(∗KEY
)
as
a
sort
of
arithmetic
version
of
the
notion
of
a
quasiconformal
map
between
Riemann
surfaces
equipped
with
distinct
holomorphic
structures.
That
is
to
say,
this
approach
allows
us
to
realize
the
assignment
(∗KEY
),
albeit
at
the
cost
of
partially
dismantling
conventional
ring/scheme
theory.
On
the
other
hand,
this
approach
requires
us
to
compute
just
how
much
of
a
distortion
occurs
as
a
result
of
deforming
conventional
ring/scheme
theory.
This
vast
computation
is
the
essential
content
of
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory.
In
the
remainder
of
the
present
paper,
we
intend
to
survey
the
ideas
surrounding
this
dismantling/deformation
of
conventional
ring/scheme
theory.
We
begin
by
observing
that
one
way
to
approach
the
issue
of
understanding
such
dismantling/deformation
operations
is
to
focus
on
that
portion
of
the
objects
under
consideration
which
is
invariant
with
respect
to
—
i.e.,
“immune”
to
—
the
dismantling/deformation
operations
under
consideration.
For
instance,
in
the
case
of
the
classical
theory
of
quasiconformal
maps
between
Riemann
surfaces
equipped
with
distinct
holomorphic
structures,
the
underlying
real
analytic
surface
of
the
Riemann
surfaces
under
consideration
constitutes
just
such
an
invariant.
In
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory,
such
invariant
mathematical
structures
are
referred
to
as
cores,
and
the
corresponding
property
of
invariance
is
referred
to
as
coricity.
In
the
case
of
the
deformations
of
the
arithmetic
holomorphic
structure
—
i.e.,
the
conventional
Shinichi
Mochizuki
12
ring/scheme-theoretic
structure
—
of
a
number
ﬁeld
equipped
with
an
elliptic
curve
that
are
studied
in
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory,
the
structures
that
correspond,
relative
to
the
analogy
with
quasiconformal
maps
between
Riemann
surfaces,
to
the
“underlying
real
analytic
surface”
are
referred
to
as
mono-analytic.
That
is
to
say,
the
term
“mono-analytic”
may
be
understood
as
a
shorthand
for
the
expression
“the
arithmetic
analogue
of
the
term
real
analytic”.
Thus,
to
summarize,
in
the
terminology
of
[IUTchI],
[IUTchII],
[IUTchIII],
[IUTchIV],
the
coricity
of
mono-analytic
structures
plays
a
central
role
in
the
theory.
The
approach
taken
in
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory
to
estimating
the
distortion
discussed
above
consists
of
constructing
“mono-analytic
containers”
in
which
the
alien
arithmetic
holomorphic
structures
that
appear
—
e.g.,
the
arithmetic
holomorphic
structure
surrounding
the
domain
of
the
assignment
(∗KEY
)
discussed
above,
when
considered
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
arithmetic
holomorphic
structure
surrounding
the
codomain
of
this
assignment
—
may
be
embedded,
up
to
certain
relatively
mild
indeterminacies
—
cf.
Theorem
4.1
below;
[IUTchIII],
Theorem
A.
Once
such
an
embedding
is
obtained,
one
may
then
proceed
to
estimate
the
logvolume
of
a
region
which
is
suﬃciently
large
as
to
cover
all
the
possibilities
that
arise
from
such
indeterminacies
—

In
this
context,
it
is
of
interest
to
note
that
the
idea
of
constructing
appropriate
“mono-analytic
containers”
has
numerous
classical
antecedents.
Perhaps
the
most
fundamental
example
is
the
idea
of
studying
the
variation
of
the
complex
holomorphic
moduli
of
an
elliptic
curve
by
studying
the
way
in
which
the
[complex]
Hodge
ﬁltration
is
embedded
within
the
topological
invariant
constituted
by
the
ﬁrst
singular
cohomology
module
with
complex
coeﬃcients
of
the
underlying
torus.
A
slightly
less
classical
example
may
be
seen
in
conventional
Arakelov
theory,
in
which
one
studies
the
metric
aspects
of
—
i.e.,
the
analytic
torsion
associated
to
—
the
holomorphic
variation
of
a
complex
variety
by
embedding
the
space
of
holomorphic
sections
of
an
ample
line
bundle
into
the
space
of
real
analytic
[or,
more
generally,
L2
-]
sections
of
the
line
bundle.
That
is
to
say,
the
theory
of
analytic
torsion
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort

of
approach
to
measuring
the
metric
aspects
of
this
embedding
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchIV],
Remark
1.10.4,
(a)].
Indeed,
scheme-theoretic
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
was
originally
conceived
precisely
as
a
sort
of
arithmetic
analogue
of
these
two
relatively
classical
examples
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[HASurI],
§1.3,
§1.4;
[IUTchIV],
Remark
1.10.4,
(b)].
At
a
concrete
level,
the
log-volume
estimates
discussed
above
may
be
summarized
as
asserting
that
the
“distortion”
that
occurs
at
the
portion
labeled
by
the
index
j
of
the
LHS
of
the
assignment
(∗KEY
)
is
[roughly]
≤
j
·
(log-diﬀF
+
log-condE
)
—
i.e.,
where
we
write
log-diﬀF
for
the
log-diﬀerent
of
the
number
ﬁeld
F
and
log-condE
for
the
log-conductor
of
the
elliptic
curve
E
[cf.
[GenEll],
Deﬁnition
1.5,
(iii),
(iv),
for
more
details].
In
particular,
by
the
exact
same
computation
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchIV],
Remark
1.10.1]
—
i.e.,
of
the
term
of
highest
order
of
the
average
over
j
—
as
the
computation
discussed
above
in
the
case
of
degrees
of
vector
bundles
on
the
moduli
stack
of
elliptic
curves
over
Q,
we
obtain
the
following
inequality:

degarith
(log(q))
=
htE
≤
(1
+
)
·
(log-diﬀF

This
inequality
is
the
content
of
the
so-called
Szpiro
Conjecture,
or,
equivalently
[cf.,
e.g.,
[GenEll],
Theorem
2.1],
the
ABC
Conjecture
—

§
2.
Teichmüller-theoretic
Deformations
In
§1,
we
discussed
in
some
detail
the
Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic
motivation
that
underlies
the
deformations
of
conventional
ring/scheme
theory
—
i.e.,
of
arithmetic
holomorphic
structure
—
that
form
the
principal
content
of
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory.
In
the
present
§2,
we
begin
to
take
a
closer
look
at
certain
qualitative
aspects
of
these
deformations
of
arithmetic
holomorphic
structure.
The
ultimate
motivating
example
that
lies
behind
these
deformations
considered
in
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory
is
the
theory
of
deformations
of
holomorphic
structure
of
a
Riemann
surface
that
are
studied
in
classical
complex
Teichmüller
theory.
Here,
we
recall
that
such
classical
Teichmüller
deformations
are
associated
to
a
nonzero
square
diﬀerential
on
a
Riemann
surface.
Relative
to
the
canonical
holomorphic
coordinates
obtained
locally
on
the
Riemann
surface
by
integrating
various
square
roots
of
the
given
square
diﬀerential,
these
classical
Teichmüller
deformations
may
be
written
in
the
form
[cf.
Fig.
2.1
below]

—
where
1
<
λ
<
∞
is
the
dilation
factor
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Lehto],
Chapter
V,
§8].
The
key
qualitative
feature
of
such
deformations
that
is
shared
by
the
deformations
of
arithmetic
holomorphic
structure
that
occur
in
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory
may
be
described
as
follows:
The
two
underlying
real
dimensions
of
the
single
holomorphic
dimension
under
consideration
are
“decoupled”
from
one
another;
then
one
of
these
two
underlying
real
dimension
is
dilated/deformed,
while
the
other
underlying
real
dimension
is
left
ﬁxed/undeformed.
Fig.
2.1:
One
dimension
is
dilated,
while
the
other
is
left

Before
proceeding,
we
introduce
some
terminology
which
will
be
useful
in
our
discussion
of
deformations
of
various
types
of
“holomorphic”
structure.
To
get
a
sense
of
the
qualitative
aspects
of
the
terminology
introduced,
it
is
useful
to
keep
in
mind
the
fundamental
example
of
the
situation
in
which
one
considers
various
complex
linear
structures
[i.e.,
“copies
of
C”]
on
a
two-dimensional
real
vector
space
[i.e.,
“R2
”]
—
cf.
the
discussion
surrounding
[IUTchII],
Introduction,
Fig.
I.3;
[Quasicon],
Appendix.
This
fundamental
example
is
illustrated
in
Fig.
2.2
below.
As
discussed
in
§1,
structures
which
are
common
to
the
various
distinct
“holomorphic”
structures
under
consideration
—
i.e.,
such
as
the
underlying
real
analytic
structure
in
the
context
of
deformations
of
the
holomorphic
structure
of
a
Riemann
surface
or
the
underlying
real
vector
space
structure
in
the
context
of
various
one-dimensional
complex
linear
structures
on
a
two-dimensional
real
vector
space
—
will
be
referred
to
as
coric.
On
the
other
hand,
structures
which
depend
on
a
speciﬁc
choice
of
“holomorphic”
structure
—
i.e.,
a
speciﬁc
choice
of
a
“spoke”
in
the
diagram
of
Fig.
2.2
—
will
be
referred
to
as
uniradial.
In
this
context,
perhaps
the
most
subtle
notion
is
the
notion
of
a
multiradial
structure.
This
term
refers
to
structures
that
depend
on
a
choice
of
“holomorphic”
structure,
but
which
are
described
in
terms
of
underlying
coric
structures
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
unaﬀected
by
alterations
in
the
“holomorphic”
structure.
In
the
case
of
the
example
illustrated
in
Fig.
2.2,
a
typical
[albeit
somewhat
tautological!]
example
of
a
multiradial

∼
structure
is
given
by
the
GL2
(R)-orbit
of
an
R-linear
isomorphism
C
→
R2
.
This
terminology
is
summarized
in
Fig.
2.3
below.
If
one
thinks
of
“holomorphic”
structures
as
“ﬁbers”
and
of
the
underlying
coric
structure
as
a
“base
space”,
then
multiradial
structures
may
be
thought
of
as
ﬁber
spaces
equipped
with
a
“connection”
that
may
be
applied
to
execute
“parallel
transport”
operations
of
ﬁbers
corresponding
to
arbitrary
motions
in
the
base
space
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchII],

1.7.1].

Another
important
motivating
example
may
be
seen
in
the
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
of
[pOrd],
[pTeich],
[CanLift].
This
theory
concerns
p-adic
canonical
liftings
of
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
a
perfect
ﬁeld
of
positive
characteristic
equipped
with
a
nilpotent
ordinary
indigenous
bundle.
Such
canonical
liftings
of
hyperbolic
curves
are
equipped
with
canonical
Frobenius
liftings
—
i.e.,
canonical
liftings
of
the
Frobenius
morphism
in
positive
characteristic
—
which
are
compatible
with
certain
canonical
Shinichi

Frobenius
liftings
on
certain
p-adic
stacks
that
may
be
thought
of
as
p-adic
étale
localizations
of
the
moduli
stack
of
hyperbolic
curves
of
a
given
type.
These
canonical
Frobenius
liftings
on
hyperbolic
curves
and
[certain
p-adic
étale
localizations
of]
moduli
stacks
of
hyperbolic
curves
may
be
regarded
as
p-adic
analogues
of
the
well-known
metric
on

Poincaré
upper
half-plane
and
the
Weil-Petersson
metric
on
complex
Teichmüller
space
—
cf.
Fig.

below.

refer
to
the

of

The
analogy
between
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory
and
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
is
as
summarized
in
Fig.
2.5
below.
In
this
analogy,
the
number
ﬁeld
equipped
with
a(n)
[once-punctured]
elliptic
curve
that
appears
in
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory
[cf.
the
discussion
of
§1!]
corresponds
to
the
positive
characteristic
hyperbolic
curve
equipped
with
a
nilpotent
ordinary
indigenous
bundle
that
appears
in
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory.
That
is
to
say,
the
number
ﬁeld,
equipped
with
the
ﬁnite
set
of
valuations
which
are
either
archimedean
valuations
or
nonarchimedean
valuations
at
which
the
given
elliptic
curve
has
bad
multiplicative
reduction,
corresponds
to
the
positive
characteristic
hyperbolic
curve
[which
may
be
thought
of
as
a
one-dimensional
function
ﬁeld,
equipped
with
ﬁnitely
many
valuations,
i.e.,
the
“cusps
at
inﬁnity”].
The
[once-punctured]
elliptic
curve
over
the
number
ﬁeld
then
corresponds
to
the
nilpotent
ordinary
indigenous
bundle
over
the
positive
characteristic
hyperbolic
curve.
Then
just
as
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory
concerns
the
issue
of
deforming
conventional
ring/scheme
theory
[i.e.,
“over
Z”],
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
concerns
the
issue
of
p-adically
deforming
certain
given
objects
in
positive
characteristic
scheme
theory.
Finally,
the
canonical
Frobenius
liftings
that
play
a
central
role
in
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
the
log-theta-lattice

theory,
which
we
shall
discuss
in
more
detail
in
§3
below.
From
this
point
of
view,
it
is
of
interest
to
recall
the
transformations
“t
→
ta
”
and
“q
→
ql
”
—
which
appeared
in
the
discussion
of
§1,
and
which
are
somewhat
reminiscent
in
form
of
the
usual
Frobenius
morphism
in
positive
characteristic.
Indeed,
the
key
assignment
(∗KEY
)

qj

j=1,...,l
—
i.e.,
which
played
a
central
role
in
the
discussion
of
§1
and
will
play
a
central
role
in
the
discussion
of
the
log-theta-lattice
in
§3
—
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“deformation”
from
the
identity
assignment
q

q
to
the
assignment


q

i.e.,
which,
if
one
reverses
the
direction
of
the
arrow,
is
reminiscent
of
the
Frobenius
morphism
in
positive
characteristic.
That
is
to
say,
the
assignment
(∗KEY
)
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“abstract
formal
analogue”
of
the
notion
of
[the

aspect
of]
a

lifting

That

may
be
thought
of
as
a
“p-adic

of
the

F,
which
may
be
characterized
by
the
property
ΦW
(F)
(λ)
=
λp
,
for
λ
∈
[F×
].
From
this
point
of
view,
one
central
aspect
of
the
theory
of
canonical
liftings
in
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
that
sets
this
theory
apart
from
the
classical
theory
of
Witt
vectors
is
the
existence
of
canonical
coordinates,
i.e.,
q-parameters
“qx
”,
in
the
completion
of
each
closed
point
x
of
the
ordinary
locus
of
a
canonically
lifted
curve
X
over
W
(F)
which
may
be
characterized
by
the
property
ΦX
(qx
)
=
qxp
—
where
we
write
ΦX
:
X
ord
→
X
ord
for
the
canonical
Frobenius
lifting
on
the
ordinary
locus
X
ord
of
[the
p-adic
formal
scheme
associated
to]
X.
These
q-parameters
may
be
regarded
as
generalizations
of
the
q-parameters
on
the
moduli
stack
of
elliptic
curves
over
Zp
that
appear
in
Serre-Tate
theory.
From
the
point
of
view
of
the
analogy
between
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
and
classical
complex
Teichmüller
theory
[i.e.,
as
reviewed
above!],
these
q-parameters
“qx
”
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
the
underlying
real
dimension
that
is
subject
to
dilation.
From
the
point
of
view
of
the
theory
of
p-adic
Galois
representations
of
the
arithmetic
fundamental
group
of
X
×Spec(Zp
)
Spec(Qp
),
the
q-parameters
“qx
”
—
i.e.,
which
have
the
eﬀect
of
“diagonalizing”
the
Frobenius
lifting
ΦX
and
exhibiting
it
as
a
“mixed
characteristic
p-adic
ﬂow”
[cf.
Fig.
2.4]
—
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
positive
slope
Galois
representations,
i.e.,
Galois
representations
that
“straddle
the
gap”
between
“mod
pn
”
and
“mod
pm
”
for
n
=
m
[cf.
the
discussion
of
the
“positive
slope
version
of
Hensel’s
lemma”
in
[AbsTopII],
Lemma
2.1;
[AbsTopII],
Remarks
2.1.1,
2.1.2].
By
contrast,
the
group
of
Teichmüller
representatives
“[F×
]”
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
[a
certain
portion
of]
the
structure
sheaf
of
the
given
positive
characteristic
hyperbolic
curve
that
is
held
ﬁxed
—
i.e.,
is
coric
—
with
respect
to
the
deformation
to
mixed
characteristic.
From
the
point
of
view
of
the
theory
of
padic
Galois
representations,
the
group
of
Teichmüller
representatives
“[F×
]”
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
[a
certain
portion
of
the]
slope
zero
Galois
representations,
i.e.,
at
a
more
concrete
level,
to
invariants
of
the
Frobenius
morphism
in
positive
characteristic.
Relative
to
the
analogy

theory
[i.e.,
as

such
slope
zero
Galois
representations
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
the
underlying
real
dimension
that
is
held
ﬁxed.
The
above
discussion
may
be
related
to
the
theory
of
absolute
Galois
groups
of
p-adic
local
ﬁelds,
as
follows.
Let
Gk
be
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
a
p-adic
local
ﬁeld
k
[i.e.,
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
].
Write
Ok
⊆
k
for
the
ring
of
integers
of
k,
Ok×
⊆
Ok
for
the
subgroup
of
units,
and
Ik
⊆
Gk
for
the
inertia
subgroup
of
Gk
.
Then
at
the
level
of
absolute
Galois
groups,
slope
zero
and
positive
slope
Galois
representations
correspond,
respectively,
to
the
maximal
unramiﬁed
quotient
Gk
/Ik
of
Gk
and
the
inertia
subgroup
Ik
⊆
Gk
.
From
the
point
of
view
of
cohomological
dimension,
the
two
cohomological
dimensions
of
Gk
may
be
thought
of
as
consisting
precisely
of
the
one
cohomological

and
the
one
cohomological
dimension
of
Ik
.
From
the
dimension
of
Gk
/Ik
(∼
=
Z)
point
of
view
of
local
class
ﬁeld
theory,
the
one
cohomological
dimension
of
Gk
/Ik
corresponds
to
the
value
group
k
×
/Ok×
,
while
the
one
cohomological
dimension
of
Ik
corresponds
to
the
group
of
units
Ok×
.
The
above
discussion
of
p-adic
local
ﬁelds
may
be
related
naturally
to
the
discussion
of
complex
Teichmüller
theory
at
the
beginning
of
the
present
§2.
That
is
to
say,
by
applying
the
exponential
function
on
C,
the
one
real
dimension
consituted
by
the
real
axis
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
the
ﬁrst
factor
“R>0
”
of
the
natural
product
decomposition
C×
=
R>0
×
S1
,
while
the
one
real
dimension
constituted
by
the
complex
axis
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
the
second
factor
“S1
”
of
this
product
decomposition.
If
one
thinks
in
terms
of
the
singular
cohomology
with
compact
supports
of
C
or
C×
,
then
the
two
underlying
real
dimensions
of
C
or
C×
may
be
thought
of
consisting
precisely
of
the
“cycles
with
compact
supports”
determined
by
these
two
real
dimensions
“R>0
”
and
“S1
”,
i.e.,
put
another
way,
of
the
value
group
and
group
of
units
of
the
complex
archimedean
local
ﬁeld
C.
That
is
to
say,
one
obtains
an
entirely
analogous
description
to
the
description
discussed
above
in
the
case
of
p-adic
local
ﬁelds.
One
important
point
of
view
in
the
context
of
the
above
discussion
of
the
“two
underlying
arithmetic
dimensions”
of
p-adic
and
complex
archimedean
local
ﬁelds
is
the
following:
p-adic
and
complex
Tate
curves
“Gm
/q
Z
”
allow
one
to
relate,
in
a
natural
fashion,
the
“two
underlying
arithmetic
dimensions”
of
the
local
ﬁeld
under
consideration
to
the
“two
underlying
geometric
dimensions”
of
the
[elliptic
curve
constituted
by
such
a]
Tate
curve.
This
point
of
view
plays
an
important
role
throughout
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory.
At
a
more
concrete
level,
the
Tate
curve
“Gm
/q
Z
”
admits
a
natural
covering,
in
a
20
Shinichi
Mochizuki
suitable
sense,
by
“Gm
”.
Then
by
considering
the
points
of
this
copy
of
“Gm
”
valued
in
the
local
ﬁeld
under
consideration,
this
natural
covering
serves
to
map
the
two
underlying
arithmetic
dimensions
of
the
above
discussion
onto
the
two
underlying
geometric
dimensions
of
the
elliptic
curve
given
by
such
a
Tate
curve.
These
two
underlying
dimensions
may
be
seen
concretely
in
the
usual
topological
[i.e.,
in
the
complex
case]
or
étale
[i.e.,
in
the
p-adic
case]
fundamental
group
of
this
elliptic
curve.
Moreover,
if
one
thinks
of
this
elliptic
curve
as
the
compactiﬁcation
of
the
once-punctured
elliptic
curve
obtained
by
removing
the
origin,
then
the
highly
nonabelian
structure
of
the
resulting
nonabelian
fundamental
group
may
be
thought
of
as
representing
the
“intertwining”
of
these
two
underlying
dimensions
—
cf.
Fig.
2.6
below.
In
this
context,
it
is
of
interest
to
recall
that
a
suitable
quotient
of
this
nonabelian
fundamental
group
of
a
once-punctured
elliptic
curve
is
naturally
isomorphic
to
the
theta
group
associated
to
the
ample
line
bundle
on
the
elliptic
curve
determined
by
the
origin
Fig.
2.6:
Intertwining
cycles
on
a
once-punctured
elliptic
curve
—
cf.
the
discussion
at
the
beginning
of
[EtTh],
§1,
§2.
Indeed,
the
above
chain
of
observations
may
be
thought
of
as
the
starting
point
for
the
introduction
of
the
theory
of
theta
functions
as
developed
in
[EtTh]
in
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory.
In
fact,
the
review
of
complex
Teichmüller
theory
given
at
the
beginning
of
the
present
§2
was
included
precisely
to
motivate
the
following
fundamental
aspect
of
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory:
The
local
portions
of
the
deformations
of
a
number
ﬁeld
equipped
with
an
elliptic
curve
that
are
constructed
in
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory
are
obtained
precisely
by
dilating
the
“one
underlying
arithmetic
dimension”
constituted
by
the
value
groups
by
means
of
a
theta
function,
while
the
“other
underlying
arithmetic
dimension”
constituted
by
the
groups
of
units
is
left
ﬁxed.
We
refer
to
§3
below
for
a
more
detailed
discussion.
In
the
context
of
the
above
discussion,
it
is
of
interest
to
recall
that
unlike
theta
groups,
the
arithmetic
fundamental
group
of
a
once-punctured
elliptic
curve
over
an
“arithmetic”
ﬁeld
such
as
a
number
ﬁeld
or
a
p-adic
local
ﬁeld
satisﬁes
highly
nontrivial

rigidity
properties,
which
are
an
important
theme
in
[EtTh],
and
which
play
a
central
role
in
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory
[cf.
the
discussion
of
§3,
§4
below].
For
instance,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
a
pro-l
theta
group
—
i.e.,
the
pro-l
group
generated
by
three
generators
α,
β,
γ
satisfying
the
relations
α
·
γ
=
γ
·
α,
β
·
γ
=
γ
·
β,
α·β
=
β·α·γ
—
admits
automorphisms
of
the
form
α
→
αλ
,
β
→
βλ,
γ
→
γλ
,
2
for
λ
∈
Z×
l
.
Such
automorphisms
cease
to
exist
if
one
regards
this
theta
group
as
a
subquotient
of
the
arithmetic
fundamental
group
of
a
once-punctured
elliptic
curve
over
a
number
ﬁeld
or
a
p-adic
local
ﬁeld.
So
far
in
our
discussion
of
“two
underlying
arithmetic
dimensions”,
we
have
concentrated
on
local
ﬁelds,
i.e.,
on
the
various
archimedean
and
nonarchimedean
localizations
“Fv
”
of
a
[say,
for
simplicity,
totally
complex]
number
ﬁeld
F
.
Note,
however,
that
by
considering
the
second
Galois
cohomology
module
of
the
absolute
Galois
group
GF
of
F
—
i.e.,
in
essence,
the
Brauer
group
of
F
—
one
may
relate,
via
the
various
restriction
maps
in
Galois
cohomology,
the
two
cohomological
dimensions
of
GF
to
the
two
cohomological
dimensions
of
the
various
nonarchimedean
Fv
.
On
the
other
hand,
in
the
various
constructions
of
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory,
the
phenomenon
of
“two
underlying
arithmetic
dimensions”
in
the
context
of
global
number
ﬁelds
will
also
appear
in
a
somewhat
diﬀerent
incarnation,
which
we
describe
as
follows.
The
two
underlying
cohomological
dimensions
of
the
absolute
Galois
group
Gk
of
a
p-adic
local
ﬁeld
k
are
easiest
to
understand
explicitly
if
one
restricts
oneself
to
the
maximal
tamely
ramiﬁed
quotient
of
Gk
,
i.e.,
which
may
be
described
explicitly
as
a
[“representatively
large”]
closed
subgroup
of
the
product
over
prime
numbers
l
=
p
of
proﬁnite
groups
of
the
form
Z
l

Z×
l
—
where
the
semi-direct
product
arises
from
the
natural
action
of
the
multiplicative
group
Z×
l
on
the
additive
group
Zl
.
This
motivates
the
point
of
view
that
the
semidirect
product
of
monoids
(Z,
+)

(Z,
×)
—
where
the
semi-direct
product
arises
from
the
natural
action
of
the
multiplicative
monoid
(Z,
×)
[i.e.,
obtained
by
considering
the
multiplicative
portion
of
the
structure
of
the
ring
of
integers
Z]
on
the
additive
group
(Z,
+)
[i.e.,
obtained
by
considering
the
additive
portion
of
the
structure
of
the
ring
of
integers
Z]
—
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“fundamental
underlying
combinatorial
prototype”
of
the
two
underlying
arithmetic
dimensions
of
a
local
ﬁeld,
as
discussed
above.

Moreover,
from
the
point
of
view
of
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
[cf.
the
discussion
of
§1],
it
is
natural
to
attempt
to
“approximate
Z”
by
means
of
the
ﬁnite
ﬁeld
Fl
,
for
some
prime
number
l,
which
one
thinks
of
being
“large”,
i.e.,
roughly
of
the
order
of
the
height
of
the
elliptic
curve
over
a
number
ﬁeld
under
consideration
—
cf.
the
discussion
of
[HASurI],
§1.3.4;
[IUTchI],
Remark
6.12.3,
(i).
In
particular,
we
shall
think
of
the
semi-direct
product
of
monoids
(Z,
+)

(Z,
×)
as
being
approximated
by
the
semi-direct
product
of
groups
F
l

F×
l
—
where
the
semi-direct
product
arises
from
the
natural
action
of
the
multiplicative
group
F×
l
on
the
additive
group
Fl
.
In
fact,
in
the
context
of
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory,
this
copy
of
Fl
=
Z/l
·
Z
will
appear
as
a
quotient
of
the
module
of
l-torsion
points
of
the
elliptic
curve
over
a
number
ﬁeld
under
consideration.
We
refer
to
the
portion
of
§3
below
concerning
the
structure
of
Hodge
theaters
for
a
more
detailed
discussion.
§

The
Log-theta-lattice
The
starting
point
of
the
various
constructions
of
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory
is
a
collection
of
initial
Θ-data
[cf.
[IUTchI],
§I1;
[IUTchI],
Deﬁnition
3.1].
Roughly
speaking,
this
data
consists,
essentially,
of
•
an
elliptic
curve
EF
over
a
number
ﬁeld
F
,
•
an
algebraic
closure
F
of
F
,
•
a

•
a

,
and
•
a
collection
of

of
a

subﬁeld
Fmod
⊆
F
that
satisfy
certain
technical
conditions
—
we
refer
to
[IUTchI],
Deﬁnition
3.1,
for
more
details.
Here,
we
write
Fmod
⊆
F
for
the
ﬁeld
of
moduli
of
EF
,
K
⊆
F
for
the
extension
ﬁeld
of
F
generated
by
the

sense,
be
summarized
as
a
step-by-step
dismantling
of
the
conventional
scheme-theoretic
arithmetic
geometry
surrounding
the
given
initial
Θ-data
which
is
suﬃciently
drastic
as
to
allow
us
to
realize
the
key
assignment
(∗KEY
)
discussed
in
§1,
but
nevertheless
suﬃciently
controlled
so
as
to
allow
us
to
compute
precisely
the
resulting
distortion
of
various
objects
and
constructions
from
conventional
arithmetic
geometry.
The
central
stage
on
which
these
constructions
are
performed
is
the
log-theta-lattice
[cf.
Fig.
3.1
below],
various
versions
of
which
are
deﬁned
in
[IUTchIII].
Each
“•”
in
Fig.
3.1
represents
a
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theater,
which
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
miniature
model
of
the
conventional
arithmetic
geometry
surrounding
the
given
initial
Θ-data.
Each
vertical
arrow
“↑”
in
Fig.
3.1
represents
a
log-link,
i.e.,
a
certain
type
of
gluing
between
various
portions
of
the
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theaters
that
constitute
the
domain
and
codomain
of
the
arrow.
Each
horizontal
arrow
“→”
in
Fig.
3.1
represents
a
Θ-link
[various
versions
of
which
are
deﬁned
in
[IUTchI],
[IUTchII],
[IUTchIII]],
i.e.,
another
type
of
gluing
between
various
portions
of
the
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theaters
that
constitute
the
domain
and
codomain
of
the
arrow.
Relative
to
the
analogy
between
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory
and
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
[cf.
the
discussion
of
§2],
each
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theater
corresponds
to
a
model
of
positive
characteristic
scheme
theory
surrounding
the
given
hyperbolic
curve
over
a
perfect
ﬁeld
equipped
with
a
nilpotent
ordinary
indigenous
bundle;
each
log-link
corresponds
to
the
Frobenius
morphism
in
positive
characteristic;
each
Θ-link
corresponds
to
a
“mixed
characteristic
transition”
from
pn
Z/pn+1
Z
to
pn−1
Z/pn
Z,
for
some
positive
integer
n.
In
particular,
the
two
dimensions
of
the
diagram
constituted
by
the
log-theta-lattice
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
the
24
Shinichi
Mochizuki
two
underlying
arithmetic
dimensions
—
i.e.,
“slope
zero”
and
“positive
slope”
—
of
a
p-adic
local
ﬁeld
discussed
in
§2.
Next,
we
proceed
to
take
a
closer
look
at
the
various
components
“•”,
“↑”,
“→”
of
the
log-theta-lattice.
Each
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theater
—
i.e.,
each
“•”
—
consists
of
a
complicated
system
of
Frobenioids
equipped
with
various
auxiliary
data.
A
Frobenioid
is
a
category
satisfying
certain
abstract
properties,
which
imply,
via
the
theory
of
[FrdI],
that
it
looks,
roughly
speaking,
like
the
sort
of
category
that
arises
from
considering
the
geometry
of
divisors
and
line
bundles
on
the
various
connected
coverings
of
an
irreducible
normal
noetherian
scheme.
Put
another
way,
a
Frobenioid
may
be
thought
of,
roughly
speaking,
as
the
result
of
“deleting
the
underlying
scheme
portion
of
a
log
scheme”
—
i.e.,
so
to
speak
(Frobenioid)
≈
(log
scheme)
−
(underlying
scheme).
def
For
instance,
If
k
is
an
algebraic
closure
of
a
local
p-adic
ﬁeld
k,
and
we
write
Gk
=
Gal(k/k)
for
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
k
and
Ok
for
the
multiplicative
monoid
determined
by
the
nonzero
integers
of
k,
then
the
local
data
Gk

Ok
—
i.e.,
which
we
think
of
as
consisting
of
some
abstract
topological
group
acting
on
an
abstract
topological
monoid
—
determines
[and,
indeed,
is
equivalent
to
the
datum
of]
def
a
certain
type
of
Frobenioid.
On
the
other
hand,
if
we
write
GF
=
Gal(F
/F
)
for
the
×
absolute
Galois
group
of
F
and
F
∪
{0}
for
the
multiplicative
monoid
determined
by
the
elements
of
F
,
then
the
global
data
GF

F
×
∪
{0}
—
i.e.,
which
we
think
of
as
consisting
of
some
abstract
topological
group
acting
on
an
abstract
monoid
equipped
with
the
various
topologies
determined
by
the
valuations
of
F
—
determines
[and,
indeed,
is
equivalent
to
the
datum
of]
a
certain
type
of
Frobenioid.
Variants
of
the
above
examples
of
Frobenioids
may
be
obtained
if
GF
(respectively,
Gk
)
is
replaced
by
one
of
the
arithmetic
fundamental
groups
ΠX
K
,
ΠC
K
of
the
orbicurves
X
K
,
C
K
discussed
above
(respectively,
by
the
arithmetic
fundamental
group
“Πv
”
of

of
the
a
certain
ﬁnite

covering
“X

[when
v

Vbad
],
“X
−

[when
v
∈
V
v
localization
of
X
K
at
v
∈
Vnon
).
Moreover,
at
v
∈
Vbad
,
it
will
turn
out
to
be
more
natural
to
take
this
“Πv
”
to
be
the
corresponding
tempered
arithmetic
fundamental
group.
The
local
and
global
Frobenioids
that
appear
in
a
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theater
correspond
essentially
to
this
sort
of
variant
of
the
examples
of
Frobenioids
just
discussed.

That
is
to
say,
at
v
∈
Vnon
,
the
ﬁeld
k
is
taken
to
be
the
completion
Kv
of
K
at
v;
by
abuse
of
notation,
we
shall
write
“F
v
”
for
any
of
the
algebraic
closures
of
Kv
def
determined
by
F
and
Gv
=
Gal(F
v
/Kv
);
we
observe
that
Gv
may
be
thought
of
as
a
quotient
Πv

Gv
of
Πv
.
An
analogous
theory
exists
at
archimedean
v
∈
V.
Throughout
the
theory
of
[IUTchI],
[IUTchII],
and
[IUTchIII],
we
shall
often
work
with
collections
of
data
of
a
certain
type
indexed
by
the
elements
of
V.
Such
collections
of
data
will
be
referred
to
as
prime-strips.
Roughly
speaking,
such
“prime-strips”
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
monoid-
or
Galois-theoretic
version
of
the
classical
notions
of
adèles/idèles.
For
instance,
by
considering
collections
of
data
constituted
by
the
various
“local
data”
—
i.e.,
Gv

[a
certain
submonoid
of]
OF
,
for
v
∈
Vnon
—
or
v
“variant
local
data”
—
i.e.,
Πv

OF
,
for
v
∈
Vnon
—
discussed
above,
we
obtain
v
F

-prime-strips
[in
the
case
of
the
“local
data”]
or
F-prime-strips
[in
the
case
of
the
“variant
local
data”].
Alternatively,
the
topological
group
portion
of
such
collections
of
data
—
i.e.,
Gv
or
Πv
,
for
v
∈
Vnon
–
gives
rise
to
D
-prime-strips
[in
the
case
of
“Gv
”]
or
D-prime-strips
[in
the
case
of
“Πv
”].
Here,
we
remark
that
the
notation

is
used
as
an
abbreviation
for
the
term
mono-analytic,
i.e.,
“the
arithmetic
analogue
of
the
term
real
analytic”
[cf.
the
discussion
of
§1].
We
refer
to
[IUTchI],
Fig.
I1.2,
and
the
surrounding
discussion
for
a
more
detailed
discussion
of
the
various
types
of
prime-strips
that
appear
in
the
theory.

and
“→”
[i.e.,
Θ-links]
The
signiﬁcance
of
working
with
various
types
of
prime-strips
lies
in
the
fact
that
prime-strips
allow
one
to
26
Shinichi
Mochizuki
simulate
a
situation
in
which
the
natural
map
Spec(K)
→
Spec(F
)
admits
“sections”
which
make
it
possible
to
consider
global
multiplicative
subspaces
and
global
canonical
generators
of
the
l-torsion
points
of
EK
—
cf.
the
discussion
of
§1;
Fig.
3.2
below.
Indeed,
the
essential
content
of
the
various
technical
conditions
imposed
on
the
collection
of
valuations
V
of
K
may
be
summarized
∼
as
the
requirement
that
V
constitutes
just
such
a
section
[cf.
the
bijection
V
→
Vmod
discussed
above]!
Put
another
way,
the
geometry
of
a
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theater
is
arranged
precisely
so
as
to
enable
one
to
construct
tautological
global
multiplicative
subspaces
and
global
canonical
generators
—
cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],
§I1,
surrounding
[IUTchI],
Fig.
I1.4.
On
the
other
hand,
since
such
“sections”
do
not
in
fact
respect
the
ring
structure
of
K,
F
—
i.e.,
put
another
way,
they
amount
to
a
partial
dismantling
of
this
ring
structure
—
it
is
necessary
to
keep
track
explicitly
of
the
various
constructions
and
objects
arising
from
this
ring
structure
that
are
of
interest
in
the
development
of
the
theory.
One
important
example
of
such
a
construction
is
the
theory
of
global
arithmetic
line
bundles
on
the
various
number
ﬁelds
under
consideration,
which
may
be
kept
track
of
by
considering
suitable
global
Frobenioids,
as
discussed
above.
In
the
case
of
mono-analytic
prime-strips
[i.e.,
prime-strips
whose
type
includes
the
symbol
“”],
we
shall
work
with
the
global
realiﬁed
Frobenioids
associated
to
the
global
Frobenioids
discussed
above
—
i.e.,
roughly
speaking,
Frobenioids
that
correspond
to
considering
arithmetic
divisors
with
coeﬃcients
∈
R.
The
resulting
collections
of
data
[i.e.,
consisting
of
mono-analytic
prime-strips
and
global
realiﬁed
Frobenioids]
are
denoted
by
means
of
the
symbol
“”
[cf.
[IUTchI],
Fig.
I1.2,
and
the
surrounding
discussion].

Q.
One
important
aspect
of
this
crucial
operation
of
“Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic
evaluation”
is
the
issue
of
keeping
track
of
the
labels

,
l
of
these
theta
values.
At
a
purely
technical
level,
one
of
the
main
functions
of
the
apparatus
constituted
by
a
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theater
is
precisely
the
task
of
serving
as
a
bookkeeping
device
for
these
labels.
In

a
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theater
consists
of
two
portions,
namely,
a
Θ±ell
-Hodge
theater
and
a
ΘNF-Hodge
theater.
The
scheme-theoretic
F

discussed
above
induces

an
Fl
-symmetry
on
certain
of
the
structures
[essentially
systems

of
a
ΘNF-Hodge
theater

in
particular,
on

which
we
think

via
the

of

In

the

F±

an

Here,
we
note
that
such

necessarily
induce

of

of

are
only
well-deﬁned
up
to

In
particular,
the
Fl

is
ill-suited
to
situations,
such
as
those
that
appear
in
the
theory
of
Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic

that
is
developed
in
[IUTchII],
that
require

to
establish

From
the
point
of
view
of
the
discussion
of

concerning
the
two
underlying
arithmetic
dimensions
of
the

structure
of

the

of

be
regarded
as
a

of

which,
as
discussed
in
§2,
is
often
regarded,
in
the

of

as
a

this

be
compared
to

in
[AbsTopIII],
§3;
the
“F
v
”
in
the
domain
(respectively,
codomain)
of
the
map
logv
arises
from
the
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theater
in
the
domain
(respectively,
codomain)
of
the
log-link
[i.e.,
the
arrow
“↑”].
The
absolute
anabelian
theory
surrounding
such
pv
adic
logarithms
is
one
of
the
central
themes
of
[AbsTopIII].
The
starting
point
of
this
theory
of
[AbsTopIII]
consists
of
the
key
observation
that
the
log-link
is
compatible
with
“some”
isomorphism
∼
Πv
→
Πv
between
the
arithmetic
fundamental
groups
Πv
on
either
side
of
the
log-link,
relative
to
the
natural
actions
via
Πv

Gv
of
Πv
that
appear
in
the
domain
and
codomain
of
the
map
logv
.
At
ﬁrst
glance,
it
may
appear
as
though
this
unspeciﬁed
isomorphism
may
be
regarded
as
the
identity
map.
In
fact,
however,
the
gap
between
the
ring/schemetheoretic
basepoints
in
the
domain
and
codomain
necessitates
the
point
of
view
that
corresponding
arithmetic
fundamental
groups
in
the
domain
and
codomain
may
only
be
related
by
means
of
some
indeterminate
isomorphism
of
abstract
topological
groups.
This
topic
will
be
discussed
in
more
detail
in
§4
below.
At
v
∈
Varc
,
the
log-link
admits
an
analogous
description.
Moreover,
if
one
allows
v
to
vary,
then
the
log-link
is
also
compatible
with
corresponding
global
arithmetic
fundamental
groups
—
i.e.,
ΠX
K
,
ΠC
K
[cf.
the
above
discussion]
—
in
the
domain
and
codomain
of
the
log-link.
Indeed,
this
sort
of
global
compatibility
with
the
log-link
is
one
of
the
central
themes
of
[AbsTopIII].
Thus,
in
summary,
corresponding
arithmetic
fundamental
groups
of
the
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theaters
in
the
domain
and
codomain
of
the
log-link
are
related
by
means
of
indeterminate
isomorphisms
of
abstract
topological
groups
∼
Πv
→
Πv
,
for
v
∈
Vnon
;
∼
ΠX
K
→
ΠX
K
;
∼
ΠC
K
→
ΠC
K
.
An
analogous
statement
holds
at
v
∈
Varc
.
This
invariance
of
the
various
arithmetic
fundamental
groups
that
appear
in
a
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theater
—
i.e.,
when
regarded
as
abstract
topological
groups
—
is
referred
to,
in
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory,
as
the
vertical
coricity
[i.e.,
coricity
with
respect
to
the
vertical
arrows
“↑”]
of
these
arithmetic
fundamental
groups,
up
to
indeterminate
isomorphism.
In
this
context,
we
recall
that
it
follows
from
the
absolute
anabelian
geometry
developed
in
[AbsTopIII]
[cf.
also
[AbsTopI],
[AbsTopII]]
that
the
ring
structure
—
i.e.,
“arithmetic
holomorphic
structure”
—
of
the
various
local
and
global
base
ﬁelds
involved
may
be
reconstructed
group-theoretically
from
these
arithmetic
fundamental
groups,
considered
up
to
isomorphism.
That
is
to
say,
this
arithmetic
holomorphic
structure
is
an
invariant
of
each
vertical
line
of
the
log-theta-lattice.
Each
Θ-link
—
i.e.,

of
the

may
be
described
as
follows.
At

the

portion

the

of
the

display
is
to
be
regarded
as
an

of

[i.e.,
both
of
which
are
isomorphic
to
the
monoid

generated,
respectively,
by
the
LHS
and

of
this
assignment.
Thus,
the
latter
portion
of
the
Θ-link
consists
precisely
of
the
key
assignment
(∗KEY
)
that
played
a
central
role
in
the
discussion
of
§1.
One
key
observation
concerning
the
Θlink
is
that
since
“OF×μ
”
is
regarded
as
an
abstract
topological
module
[equipped
with
a
v

×
-indeterminacies
certain
“integral

it
is
subject
to
the
Z
OF×μ
v
×

λ∈Z
—
i.e.,
given
by
“raising
to
the
λ-th
power”.
Another
key
observation
concerning
the
Θ-link
at
v
∈
Vbad
is
that
it
is
compatible
with
“some”
isomorphism
∼
Gv
→
Gv
between
the
Galois
groups
Gv
on
either
side
of
the
Θ-link,
relative
to
the
natural
actions
of
Gv
that
appear
in
the
domain
and
codomain
of
the
Θ-link.
At
ﬁrst
glance,
it
may
appear
as
though
this
unspeciﬁed
isomorphism
may
be
regarded
as
the
identity
map.
In
fact,
however,
the
gap
between
the
ring/scheme-theoretic
basepoints
in
the
domain
and
codomain
necessitates
the
point
of
view
that
corresponding
arithmetic
fundamental
groups
in
the
domain
and
codomain
may
only
be
related
by
means
of
some
indeterminate
isomorphism
of
abstract
topological
groups.
This
topic
will
be
discussed
in
more
detail
in
§4
below.
One
central
aspect
of
the
theory
of
Frobenioids
developed
in
[FrdI]
is
the
fundamental
dichotomy
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[FrdI],
§I4;
[IUTchI],
§I2,
§I3;
the
beginning
of
[IUTchII],
Introduction]
between
“étale-like”
and
“Frobenius-like”
structures.
In
the
discussion
above
of
various
examples
of
Frobenioids,
the
étale-like
portion
of
the
corresponding
Frobenioids
consists
of
the
various
arithmetic
fundamental
groups
Gk
,
GF
,
Gv
,
Πv
,
ΠX
K
,
ΠC
K
.
Thus,
the
étale-like
portion
of
a
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theater,
when
regarded
up
to
indeterminate
isomorphism,
is
vertically
coric.
In
a
similar
vein,
at
32
Shinichi
Mochizuki
v
∈
Vbad
,
the
pair
[i.e.,
regarded
as
an
abstract
topological
module
equipped
with
the
action
of
an
abstract
topological
group]
(Gv

OF×μ
),
when
regarded
up
to
indetermiv
nate
isomorphism,
is
horizontally
coric,
i.e.,
invariant
with
respect
to
the
[horizontal
arrow
“→”
constituted
by
the]
Θ-link.
Unlike
the
case
with
the
vertically
coric
arithmetic
fundamental
groups
Πv
,
ΠX
K
,
ΠC
K
,
it
is
not
possible
to
reconstruct
the
ring
structure
of
the
local
base
ﬁelds
involved
from
the
absolute
Galois
group
Gv
.
That
is
to
say,
the
vertically
coric
arithmetic
holomorphic
structures
in
each
vertical
line
of
the
log-theta-lattice
[cf.
the
above
discussion]
are
not
compatible
with
the
horizontal
arrows
of
the
log-theta-lattice.
On
the
other
hand,
the
Frobenius-like
portion
of
the
various
examples
of
Frobenioids
given
above
consists
of
the
abstract
monoids,
i.e.,
×
∪
{0}.
Here,
we
recall
that
such
monoids
are
often
reconstructed
by
Ok
,
OF
,
F
v
means
of
anabelian
algorithms
from
various
arithmetic
fundamental
groups,
i.e.,
from
various
étale-like
structures.
In
such
a
situation,
if
one
considers
the
reconstructed
monoid
together
with
the
arithmetic
fundamental
group
and
reconstruction
algorithm
from
which
it
was
reconstructed,
then
the
resulting
collection
of
data
constitutes
an
étale-like
structure.
On
the
other
hand,
if
one
forgets
the
portion
of
such
a
collection
of
data
that
concerns
the
way
in
which
the
monoid
was
reconstructed
from
an
arithmetic
fundamental
group,
i.e.,
if
one
regards
the
monoid
just
as
some
abstract
monoid,
then
the
resulting
collection
of
data
constitutes
a
Frobenius-like
structure.
One
important
observation
in
the
context
of
the
log-
and
Θ-links
is
the
following:
The
“wall”
—
i.e.,
relative
to
the
conventional
ring/scheme
structures
in
the
domain
and
codomain
—
constituted
by
the
assignment
that
gives
rise
to
the
Θ-link
at
v
∈
Vbad
can
only
be
deﬁned
by
working
with
abstract
topological
monoids,
i.e.,
with
Frobenius-like
structures.
An
analogous
statement
holds
for
the
log-link.
Put
another
way,
it
is
only
by
stripping
the
abstract
topological
monoids
that
occur
in
the
LHS
and
RHS
of
the
assignment
that
gives
rise
to
the
Θ-link
of
any
information
concerning
how
those
abstract
topological
monoids
were,
for
instance,
reconstructed
from
various
arithmetic
fundamental
groups
that
appear
[cf.
the
above
discussion!]
that
one
may
obtain
isomorphic
mathematical
objects
that
allow
one
to
deﬁne
the
gluing
of
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theaters
constituted
by
the
Θ-link
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchII],
Remark
1.11.3,
(i)].
An
analogous
statement
holds
for
the
log-link.
By
contrast,
the
importance
of
étale-like
structures
arises
from
the
fact
that
they
have
the
power
to
penetrate
these
“walls”
—
cf.
the
key
vertical
and
horizontal
coricity
properties
discussed
above.
The
Θ-link
is
deﬁned
for
[both
nonarchimedean
and
archimedean]
v
∈
Vgood
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
compatible
with
the
deﬁnition
at
v
∈
Vbad
,
relative
to
the
“product
A
Panoramic
Overview

33
formula”
[i.e.,
of
elementary
number
theory,
that
relates
the
values
that
arise
as
a
result
of
applying
various
valuations
of
a
number
ﬁeld].
This
compatibility
with
the
product
formula
allows
one
to
deﬁne
the
Θ-link
also
for
certain
global
realiﬁed
Frobenioids.
One
fundamental
consequence
of
the
deﬁnition
of
the
vertical
and
horizontal
arrows
of
the
log-theta-lattice
by
means
of
various
Frobenius-like
structures
—
i.e.,
such
as
abstract
monoids
—
is
the
following
observation:
the
log-theta-lattice
is
not
symmetric
with
respect
to
permutations
that
switch
the
domain
and
codomain
of
the
various
arrows
that
appear
in
the
log-theta-lattice.
By
contrast,
if,
for
some
v
∈
Vnon
,
one
considers
the
“vertically
coric
copy
of
Πv
considered
up
to
isomorphism”
associated
to
each
vertical
line
of
the
log-theta-lattice,
and
one
regards
such
copies
†
Πv
,
‡
Πv
arising
from
distinct
vertical
lines
—
i.e.,
distinct
arithmetic
holomorphic
structures
—
as
being
related
by
means
of
some
indeterminate
isomorphism
[i.e.,
of
topological
groups]
of
the
associated
quotients
†
Πv

†
Gv
,
‡
Πv

‡
Gv
,
then
one
obtains
a
diagram
[cf.
Fig.
3.5
below]
in
which
the
spokes
—
i.e.,
each
of
which
arises
from
a
vertical
line
of
the
log-theta-lattice
—
satisfy
the
property
that
the
diagram
is
invariant
with
respect
to
arbitrary
permutations
of
the

This
diagram
of
étale-like
structures
[i.e.,

is
referred
to
as
the

In

we
remark
that

may
be
thought
of
as

sort

In

essentially
a

[cf.
the

at
the
beginning
of
[FrdII],
§2]
—
i.e.,
by
considering
the

action

of
a

—
once
one
establishes

—

Introduction;

The
related
Kummer
theory
is
performed
in
the
portion
of
a
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theater
constituted
by
a
Θ±ell
-Hodge
theater,
i.e.,
the
portion
where
the
F±
l
-symmetry
appears
[cf.
the
above
discussion].
In
this
situation,
we
remark
that
when
one
performs
the
Hodge-Arakelov
theoretic
evaluation
of
the
theta
functions
involved
at
l-torsion
points
whose
labels
are
subject
to
the
bookkeeping
apparatus
provided
by
some
Θ±ell
-Hodge
theater
[cf.
the
above
discussion],
it
is
necessary
to
verify
that
proﬁnite
conjugates
[arising
from
the
proﬁnite
geometric
fundamental
groups
that
occur
in
the
global
portion
of
such
a
Θ±ell
-Hodge
theater]
of
the
various
tempered
arithmetic
fundamental
groups
at
v
∈
Vbad
do
not
intersect
one
another
in
an
“unexpected
fashion”.
This
non-existence
of
“unexpected
intersections”
is
obtained
by
applying
a
certain
technical
result
[cf.
[IUTchI],
Theorem
B;
[IUTchI],
§2;
[IUTchII],
§2]
which
follows
from
the
theory
of
[Semi].
Here,
we
remark
in
passing
that,
relative
to
the
analogy
with
the
upper
half-plane
[cf.
Fig.
3.4],
this
non-existence
of
unexpected
intersections
is
reminiscent
of
the
discreteness
in
SL2
(R)
of
the
various
SL2
(Z)-conjugates

of
the
subgroup
of
upper
triangular
unipotent
matrices
10
∗1
in
SL2
(Z),
i.e.,
despite
the
fact
that
the
natural
induced
topology
[i.e.,
induced
by
the
topology
of
the
ambient
complex
projective
line]
on
the
set
of
cusps
of
the
upper
half-plane
[i.e.,
Q
∪
{∞}]
is
far
from
discrete.
One
important
aspect
of
this
Kummer
theory
involving
the
data
of
(b),
(c)
is
the
interpretation
of
the
various
rigidity
properties
in
terms
of
the
notion
of
multiradiality,
i.e.,
roughly
speaking,
as
a
sort
of
rigidity
with
respect
to
“parallel
transport”
between
spokes
of
the
étale-picture
—
cf.
the
discussion
of
multiradiality
in
§2;
[IUTchIII],
Fig.
3.5,
and
the
surrounding
discussion.
Relative
to
the
analogy
with
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory,
this
multiradial,
or
“parallel
transport”,
interpretation
is
reminiscent
of
the
Frobenius
crystal
structure
on
the
canonical
indigenous
bundles
of
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory.
Alternatively,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
scheme-theoretic
HodgeArakelov
theory
reviewed
in
§1,
this
multiradial,
or
“parallel
transport”,
interpretation
is
reminiscent
of
the
theory
of
the
crystalline
theta
object
discussed
in
[HASurII],
§2.
36
Shinichi
Mochizuki
In
this
context,
we
remark
that
one
important
consequence
of
the
theory
surrounding
the
multiradial
interpretation
of
the
rigidity
properties
of
the
étale
theta
function
in
the
case
of
the
data
of
(b),
together
with
the
closely
F±
l
-symmetry,
is
the


related
highly
distinguished
nature
of
the
theta
values
qj
2
j=1,...,l
that
occur
in
(b).
That
is
to
say,
the
intricate
technical
apparatus
that
constitutes
the
technical
backbone
of
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory
would
collapse
if
one
attempted
instead
to
work
with,
say,
arbitrary
powers
“q
N
”
of
q.
Finally,
we
observe
that
there
is
an
interesting
analogy
[cf.
Fig.
4.2
below]
between
this
multiradial
intepretation
and
the
classical
theory
of
the
functional
equation
of
the
theta
function,
i.e.,
“Jacobi’s
identity”
—
cf.,
e.g.,
[DmMn],
§1.7.5,
as
well
as
[HASurI],
§2.1;
[EtTh],
Remarks
1.6.2,
1.6.3.
First
of
all,
we
recall
that
this
functional
equation
is
in
essence
a
formal
consequence
of
the
invariance
of
the
Gaussian
distribution
with
respect
to
the
Fourier
transform
on
the
real
line
[cf.,
e.g.,
[DmMn],
§1.7.5].
Moreover,
this
invariance
property
is
closely
related
to
and,
indeed,
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“function-theoretic
version”
of
the
computation
of
the
Gaussian
integral
discussed
above
[cf.,
e.g.,
[DmMn],
§1.7.5].
From
this
point
of
view,
we
observe
that
just
as
the
computation
of
the
Gaussian
integral
may
be
thought
of
as
being
analogous
to
the
log-volume
computation
that
yields
Corollary
4.2
below
[cf.
the
above
discussion],
the
invariance
of
the
Gaussian
distribution
with
respect
to
the
Fourier
transform
may
be
thought
of
as
being
analogous
to
the
multiradial
description
given
in
Theorem
4.1
below.
At
a
more
technical
level,
we
observe
that
the
multiradiality
of
the
étale
theta
function
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“parallel
transport”
—
i.e.,
a
sort
of
“integration”
—
that
exhibits
the
rigidity
of
the
theta
functions
involved,
relative
to
a
situation
in
which
the
units
modulo
torsion
“O×μ
”
are
subject
to
a
mono-analytic

×
-indeterminacy
—
i.e.,
an
indeterminacy
with
respect
to
an
exponentiation
operZ

×
.
This
description
is
reminiscent
of
the
ation
on
the
units
with
respect
to
some
λ
∈
Z
Fourier
transform,
i.e.,
an
integral
of
the
Gaussian
distribution
subject
to
the
eﬀect
of
a
[non-holomorphic!]
real
analytic
factor
constituted
by
a
unit
“eit
∈
S1
⊆
C×
”
which
is
subject
to
an
exponentiation
operation
with
respect
to
some
t
∈
R.
In
the
case
of
the
theory
of
[EtTh],
the
desired
rigidity
properties
are
proven,
in
eﬀect,
by
considering
the
quadratic
structure
of
the
commutator
relation
in
the
theta
group
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchIII],
Remark
2.1.1].
In
the
case
of
the
computation
of
the
Fourier
transform
of
the
Gaussian
distribution,
the
essence
of
the
computation
consists
of
an
analysis,
by
“completing
the
square”,
of
the
quadratic
expression
that
appears
in
the
exponent.

2
From
the
point
of
view
of
the
discussion
of
§1,
the
theta
values
q
j

j=1,...,l
that
occur
in
(b)
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
function-theoretic
expression
of
the

canonical
multiplicative
subspace
and
generators
that
occur
in
a
neighborhood
of
a
ﬁxed
cusp
of
the
moduli
stack
of
elliptic
curves.
Then,
relative
to
the
schemetheoretic
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
of
[HASurI],
[HASurII],
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory
provides
a
means
of
globally
extending
[cf.
the
ΘNF-Hodge
theater
portion
of
a
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theater]
this
function-theoretic
expression
of
the
canonical
multiplicative
subspace
and
generators
[i.e.,
which
is
most
naturally
deﬁned
in
the
Θ±ell
-Hodge
theater
portion
of
a
Θ±ell
NF-Hodge
theater].
This
state
of
aﬀairs
is
strongly
reminiscent
of
the
essential
content
of
Jacobi’s
identity,
i.e.,
which
asserts
that
the
global
extension
to
the
upper
half-plane
of
the
Gaussian
expansion
of
the
theta
function
in
a
neighborhood
of
the
cusp
at
inﬁnity
of
the
upper
half-plane
admits
a
similar
Gaussian
expansion
in
a
neighborhood
of
the
cusp
at
zero.
Here,
we
recall
that
often
classical
expositions
[i.e.,
such
as,
for
instance,
the
exposition
given
in
[DmMn],
§1.7.5]
of
this
topic
only
treat
the
restriction
to
the
imaginary
axis
of
the
theta
function
on
the
upper
half-plane,
since
this
restriction
is
quite
suﬃcient
for
the
Fourier
analysis
involved.
[That
is
to
say,
if
one
writes
z
for
the
standard
coordinate
on
the
upper
half-plane,
then
the
variable
“t”
of
[DmMn],
§1.7.5,
may
be
thought
of
as
being
related
to
z
via
the
equation
z
=
it.]
From
the
point
of
view
of
the
analogy
with
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory,
the
theory
of
analytic
continuation
to
a
neighborhood
of
the
cusp
at
zero
of
the
function
a
priori
only
deﬁned
in
a
neighborhood
of
the
cusp
at
inﬁnity
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
the
absolute
anabelian
representation
of
local
and
global
arithmetic
holomorphic
structures
aﬀorded
by
the
theory
of
[AbsTopIII]
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],
Remarks
4.3.1,
4.3.2;
the
theory
of
Aut-holomorphic
structures
given
in
[AbsTopIII],
§2;
the
theory
of
Belyi
cuspidalizations
given
in
[AbsTopII],
§3,
which
underlies
the
theory
of
[AbsTopIII],
§1].
That
is
to
say,
just
as
the
Fourier
transform
of
the
Gaussian
distribution
induces
—
i.e.,
is
“intertwined”
with
—
the

“rotation”
of
the
upper
half-plane
corresponding
to
the
matrix
−10
10
[i.e.,
in
the
notation
of
[DmMn],
§1.7.5,
the
transformation
t
→
1t
],
the
multiradial
description
of
Theorem
4.1
below
is
“intertwined”
[cf.
the
discussion
following
Theorem
4.1]
with
the
“rotation”
of
the
additive
and
multiplicative
structures
[i.e.,
the
two
underlying
arithmetic
dimensions]
of
the
arithmetic
holomorphic
structure
associated
to
a
vertical
line
of
the
log-theta-lattice
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[AbsTopIII],
§I4;
[IUTchIII],
Remarks
1.4.1,
1.4.2].
In
this
context,
it
is
perhaps
of
interest
to
recall
that
the
approach
taken
in
[IUTchI]
to
constructing
global
multiplicative
subspaces
and
canonical
generators
via
prime-strips
[cf.
the
above
discussion!]
was
originally
motivated
by
an
analysis
of
the
[geometrically!]
global
multiplicative
subspaces
that
appear
in
p-adic
Hodge
theory,
for
instance,
in
the
case
of
the
local
system
of
p-adic
Tate
modules
associated
to
the
tautological
family
of
elliptic
curves
over
the
moduli
stack
of
elliptic
curves
over
Zp
[cf.
[HASurII],
Shinichi
Mochizuki
38
Remark
3.7].
That
is
to
say,
the
absolute
anabelian
approach
taken
in
the
context
of
prime-strips
was
originally
motivated
by
contemplation
of
the
essential
content
of
the
operation
of
tensoring,
over
Zp
,
such
p-adic
Tate
modules
with
p-adically
completed
rings
that
arise
as
normalizations
of
local
aﬃne
rings
on
the
moduli
stack
in
maximal
proﬁnite
étale
extensions
in
characteristic
zero
—
a
somewhat
curious
situation
in
the
sense
that
the
same
rings
occur
both
as
localizations
of
the
base
scheme
and
as
rings
of
extended
coeﬃcients
of
étale
local
systems
of
Tate
modules
[cf.
[IUTchI],
Remarks
4.3.1,
4.3.2;
[HASurII],
Remark
3.7;
[IUTchIV],
Remark
3.3.2].
Indeed,
the
natural
isomorphisms
—
which
constitute
the
starting
point
of
p-adic
Hodge
theory!
—
between
Galois
cohomology
modules
of
such
rings
[which,
a
priori,
are
not
compatible
with
Zariski
localization!]
and
modules
of
diﬀerentials
[which
are
compatible
with
Zariski
localization!]
are
somewhat
reminiscent
of
the
local/global
functoriality
of
the
absolute
anabelian
algorithms
of
[AbsTopIII],
§1,
as
well
as
of
the
theory
of
Belyi
cuspidalizations
[i.e.,
which
may
also
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
compatibility
of
arithmetic
fundamental
groups
with
Zariski
localization
on
a
hyperbolic
curve],
which
underlies
these
absolute
anabelian
algorithms.

Inter-universality

One
important
aspect
of
the
log-
and
Θ-links
—
i.e.,
the
vertical
and
horizontal
arrows
of
the
log-theta-lattice
—
is
the
property
that
the
assignments
that
constitute
the
log-

[cf.
the
discussion
of

are
not
compatible
with
the
ring

in
the

and
codomain
of
these

On

from
the
point

of
the
classical
theory
of
Galois
groups
—
or,
more
generally,
étale
fundamental

of

—
a

is
typically
regarded
not
as
some
“abstract

but
rather
as
a
group
of
ﬁeld
automorphisms
Autﬁeld
(k)
of
some
algebraic
closure
k
of
a
given
[say,
perfect]
ﬁeld
k.
In
the
classical
theory
of
étale
fundamental
groups
of
schemes,
a
morphism
between
the
schemes
under
consideration
—
i.e.,
in
essence,
up
to
Zariski
localization,
a
ring
homomorphism
—
gives
rise,
in
a
natural
fashion,
to
outer
homomorphisms
between
the
corresponding
étale
fundamental
groups
by
considering
the
homomorphism
between
algebraically
closed
ﬁelds
associated
[up
to
suitable
indeterminacies],
relative
to
the
geometric
basepoints
under
consideration,
to
such
a
ring
homomorphism.
That
is
to
say,
at
least
from
an
a
priori
point
of
view,
there
is
no
natural
functorial
way
to
deﬁne
an
“induced
homomorphism
of
Galois
groups”
arising
from
an
assignment
which
is
not
a
ring
homomorphism.
In
particular,
when
one
considers
the
relationship
between
the
Galois
groups
in
the
domain
and
codomain
of
such
a
non-ring/scheme-theoretic
assignment,
one
must
sacriﬁce
the
datum
consisting
A

39
of
the
embedding
of
such
a
Galois
group
into
some
“Autﬁeld
(k)”.
That
is
to
say,
in
this
sort
of
a
situation,
one
must
work
with
the
Galois
groups
involved
as
abstract
topological
groups,
which
are
not
equipped
with
the
“labeling
apparatus”
[i.e.,
on
elements
of
such
a
Galois
group]
arising
from
the
action
via
ﬁeld
automorphisms
[i.e.,
the
embedding
into
“Autﬁeld
(k)”];
it
is
precisely
this
state
of
aﬀairs
that
requires
one
to
apply
various
results
in
absolute
anabelian
geometry
in
order
to
describe
ring/scheme-theoretic
structures
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
“wall”
constituted
by
the
log-,
Θ-links
[cf.
the
discussion
of
§3;
Theorem
4.1
below].
Such
a
labeling
apparatus
may
also
be
thought
of
as
the
labeling
apparatus
determined
by
a
speciﬁc
choice
of
ring/scheme-theoretic
basepoint,
or,
alternatively,
by
the
universe
that
gives
rise
to
the
model
of
set
theory
that
underlies
the
codomain
of
the
ﬁber
functor
determined
by
such
a
basepoint.
It
is
for
this
reason
that
we
refer
to
this
aspect
of
the
theory
by
the
term
“inter-universal”
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[IUTchI],
§I3].
Thus,
if
one
considers
the
portion
of
the
log-theta
lattice,
say,
at
some
ﬁxed
v
∈
non
V
,
then
one
must
contend
with,
roughly
speaking,
a
distinct
universe
—
i.e.,
a
distinct
labeling
apparatus
for
the
sets
that
occur
in
the
model
of
set
theory
with
respect
to
which
one
considers
some
local
Galois
category
at
v
—
at
each
“•”
of
the
log-theta-lattice.
In
a
similar
vein
—
cf.
the
discussion
of
prime-strips
as
“sections”
in
§3
—
one
must
contend
with
“changes
of
universe”
when
one
passes
back
and
forth
between
local
[i.e.,
at
some
v
∈
Vnon
]
and
global
Galois
categories
[i.e.,
Galois
categories
associated
to
global
arithmetic
fundamental
groups
such
as
ΠX
K
,
ΠC
K
].
In
this
context,
it
is
perhaps
useful
to
observe
that
in
order
to
regard
the
correspondence
between
the
“Πv
’s”
in
the
domain
and
codomain
of
the
portion
of
the
log-link
at
v
∈
Vnon
as
the
“identity”,
it
is
necessary
to
identify
the
copies
of
F
v
in
the
domain
and
codomain
of
the
log-link.
On
the
other
hand,
such
an
identiﬁcation
may
only
be
deﬁned
if
one
makes
use
of
the
ring
structure
of
F
v
,
which
is
incompatible
with
the
Θ-link.
Put
another
way,
the
domain
of
the
Θ-link
can
only
be
considered
in
a
meaningful
way
if
one
disables
such
an
identiﬁcation
between
the
domain
and
codomain
of
the
log-link.
Thus,
in
summary,
the
highly
non-commutative
nature
of
the
log-thetalattice
has
the
eﬀect
of
obligating
one
to
work
with
distinct
labeling
apparatuses
in
the
domain
and
codomain
of
the
vertical
arrows
of
the
log-theta-lattice.
From
the
point
of
view
of
the
analogy
between
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory
and
Jacobi’s
identity
for
the
theta
function
discussed
at
the
end
of
§3
[cf.
also
Fig.
4.2
below],
it
is
perhaps
of
interest
to
note
that
the
labeling
apparatus
for
sets
arising
from
a
universe
may
be
thought
as
corresponding
to
the
labeling
apparatus
for
the
points
of
a
space
[i.e.,
such
as
the
upper-half
plane]
provided
by
a
choice
of
coordinates.
In
particular,
“changes
of
universe”
may
be
regarded
as
corresponding
to
changes
of
coordinates.
In
the
context
of
Jacobi’s
identity,
the
basepoint
given
by
the
cusp
at
inﬁnity
Shinichi
Mochizuki
40
gives
rise
to
a
choice
of
coordinates,
as
well
as
a
canonical
multiplicative
subspace
and
generator
of
the
topological
fundamental
group
[i.e.,
∼
=
Z2
]
of
the
tautological
family
of
elliptic
curves
over
the
upper
half-plane.
The
Gaussian
expansion
of
the
theta
function
may
then
be
thought
of
as
a
function-theoretic
representation
of
this
canonical
multiplicative
subspace
and
generator,
i.e.,
of
the
given
choice
of
basepoint.
Thus,
the
equality
of
Gaussian
expansions
consituted
by
Jacobi’s
identity
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“inter-basepoint/inter-coordinate
system”
comparison
between
the
basepoints/coordinate
systems
arising
from
the
cusp
at
inﬁnity
and
the
cusp
at
zero.
From
an
elementary
computational
point
of
view,
this
comparison
gives
rise
to
a
somewhat
startling
improvement
in
computational
accuracy
[cf.
the
discussion
at
the
beginning
of
[DmMn],
§1.7.5]!
Perhaps
it
is
natural
to
regard
this
startling
improvement
in
computational
accuracy
as
a
sort
of
classical
analogue
of
the
somewhat
“startling”
numerical
consequence
constituted
by
Corollary
4.2
of
the
following
abstract
result
[cf.

4.2:
The
analogy
between
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory
and
Jacobi’s
identity
for
the
theta
function
At
ﬁrst
glance,
it
may
appear
as
though
the
log-link
is
entirely
irrelevant
to
the
content
of
Theorem
4.1.
In
fact,
however,
the
theory
surrounding
the
log-link
plays
a
central
role
in
the
construction
of
the
multiradial
description
of
Theorem
4.1.
That
is
to
say,
from
a
naive,
a
priori
point
of
view,
there
is
no
natural
way
to
obtain
an
action
Shinichi
Mochizuki
42
of
the
“q
j
’s”
that
appear
in
component
(b)
on
the
multiplicative
monoids
“O×μ
”
that
appear
in
component
(a).
If,
on
the
other
hand,
one
considers
the
images
via
the
maps
“logv
”
[cf.
the
discussion
of
§3]
of
these
multiplicative
monoids
“O×μ
”,
then
one
2
obtains
additive
monoids
on
which
the
“q
j
’s”
that
appear
in
component
(b)
—
as
well
as
the
global
number
ﬁelds
that
give
rise
to
the
global
realiﬁed
Frobenioids
that
appear
in
component
(c)
—
do
indeed
act
naturally.
Since,
however,
the
log-theta-lattice
is
highly
non-commutative,
it
is
a
highly
nontrivial
task
to
formulate
a
“multiradial
description”
that
makes
use
of
the
mono-analytic
containers
[cf.
the
discussion
of
§1]
for
the
data
of
(b),
(c)
that
arise,
in
eﬀect,
by
taking
the
logarithm
of
the
data
of
(a).
This
highly
nontrivial
task
is
achieved
by
applying
the
interpretation
of
the
theory
of
[AbsTopIII]
that
is
developed
in
[IUTchIII],
§1,
§3
—
cf.
the
discussion
surrounding
Figs.
I.4,
I.5,
I.6
in
[IUTchIII],
Introduction.
One
important
aspect
of
this
portion
of
the
theory
is
the
compatibility
of
the
log-link
with
the
Kummer
theory
of
(a),
(b),
(c)
that
was
discussed
in
§3
[cf.
[IUTchIII],
Theorem
A,
(ii)].
In
the
case
of
(a),
this
compatibility
is
achieved
only
in
the
form
of
an
“upper
semi-compatibility”,
that
is
to
say,
only
at
the
cost
of
admitting
a
certain
indeterminacy
which,
from
the
point
of
view
of
Corollary
4.2
below,
is
ultimately
reﬂected
in
the
fact
that
the
logvolume
computation
that
gives
rise
to
Corollary
4.2
only
yields
an
inequality,
i.e.,
as
opposed
to
a
precise
equality;
classical
analogues
of
this
inequality
may
be
seen
in
the
examples
that
appear
in
the
discussion
of
hyperbolicity
following
Corollary
4.2.
In
the
case
of
(b),
this
compatibility
follows
from
the
rigidity
properties
of
the
étale
theta
function,
while,
in
the
case
of
(c),
it
follows
from
a
suitable
interpretation
of
various
well-known
facts
from
elementary
algebraic
number
theory.
In
particular,
we
observe
in
passing
that,
relative
to
the
analogy
with
Jacobi’s
identity
for
the
theta
function
[cf.
Fig.
4.2],
this
compatibility
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding,
in
the
case
of
(b),
to
the
“intertwining”
of
the
Fourier
transform
of
the
Gaussian
distribution
with
the

rotation
−10
10
,
and,
in
the
case
of
(c),
to
the
compatibility
of
this
rotation
with
the
toral
symmetries
of
the
upper
half-plane
that
appear
in
Fig.
3.4.
In
this
context,
it
is
also
important
to
avail
oneself
of
the
compatibility
with
the
proﬁnite
topology
of
the
algorithms
that
give
rise
to
the
various
local
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphisms
[cf.
the
discussion
of
§3]
that
are
applied
to
the
data
of
(a),
(b)
[cf.
the
discussion
surrounding
[IUTchIII],
Fig.
3.5].
This
compatibility
is
a
property
that
is
not
shared
by
the
algorithms
that
give
rise
to
the
global
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphisms
that
are
applied
to
the
global
number
ﬁelds
that
give
rise
to
the
data
of
(c).
The
various
properties
satisﬁed
by
the
three
Frobenius-like
components
(a),
(b),
(c)
of
the
collection
of
data
that
appears
in
the
domain
of
the
Θ-link
are
summarized
in
Fig.
4.1
above
[cf.
also
the
discussion
of
§3].
These
properties
play
a
key
role
in
the
proofs
of
the
main
results
of
[IUTchIII].
