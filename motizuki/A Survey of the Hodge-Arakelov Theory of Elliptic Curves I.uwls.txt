Abstract:
The
purpose
of
the
present
manuscript
is
to
give
a
survey
of
the
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
of
elliptic
curves
(cf.
[Mzk1,2])
—
i.e.,
a
sort
of
“Hodge
theory
of
elliptic
curves”
analogous
to
the
classical
complex
and
p-adic
Hodge
theories,
but
which
exists
in
the
global
arithmetic
framework
of
Arakelov
theory
—
as
this
theory
existed
at
the
time
of
the
workshop
on
“Galois
Actions
and
Geometry”
held
at
the
Mathematical
Sciences
Research
Institute
(MSRI)
at
Berkeley,
USA,
in
October
1999.
Since
then,
various
further
important
developments
have
occurred
in
this
theory
(cf.
[Mzk3,4,5],
etc.),
but
we
shall
not
discuss
these
developments
in
detail
in
the
present
manuscript.

§1.1.
The
Main
Theorem
The
fundamental
result
of
the
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
of
elliptic
curves
is
a
Comparison
Theorem
(cf.
Theorem
A
below)
for
elliptic
curves,
which
states
roughly
that:
The
space
of
“polynomial
functions”
of
degree
(roughly)
<
d
on
the
universal
extension
of
an
elliptic
curve
maps
isomorphically
via
restriction
to
the
space
of
(set-theoretic)
functions
on
the
d-torsion
points
of
the
universal
extension.
This
rough
statement
is
essentially
precise
for
(smooth)
elliptic
curves
over
ﬁelds
of
characteristic
zero
(cf.
Theorem
Asimple
).
For
elliptic
curves
in
mixed
characteristic
and
degenerating
elliptic
curves,
this
statement
may
be
made
precise
(i.e.,
the
restriction
map
becomes
an
isomorphism)
if
one
modiﬁes
the
“integral
structure”
on
the
space
of
polynomial
functions
in
an
appropriate
fashion
(cf.
Theorem
A).
Similarly,
in
the
case
of
elliptic
curves
over
the
complex
numbers,
one
can
ask
whether
or
not
one
obtains
an
isometry
if
one
puts
natural
Hermitian
metrics
on
the
spaces
involved.
In
[Mzk1],
we
also
compute
what
modiﬁcation
to
these
metrics
is
necessary
to
obtain
an
isometry
(or
something
very
close
to
an
isometry).
In
characteristic
zero,
the
universal
extension
of
an
elliptic
curve
may
be
regarded
as
the
de
Rham
cohomology
of
the
elliptic
curve,
with
coeﬃcients
in
the
sheaf
of
invertible
functions
on
the
curve.
On
the
other
hand,
the
torsion
points
of
the
elliptic
curve
may
be
regarded
as
a
portion
of
the
étale
cohomology
of
the
elliptic
curve.
Thus,
one
may
regard
this
Comparison
Theorem
as
a
sort
of
isomorphism
between
the
de
Rham
and
étale
cohomologies
of
the
elliptic
curve,
given
by
considering
functions
on
each
of
the
respective
cohomology
spaces.
When
regarded
from
this
point
of
view,
this
Comparison
Theorem
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
discrete
or
Arakelov-theoretic
analogue
of
the
usual
comparison
theorems
between
de
Rham
and
étale/singular
cohomology
in
the
complex
and
p-adic
cases.
This
analogy
with
the
“classical”
local
comparison
theorems
can
be
made
very
precise,
and
is
one
of
the
main
topics
of
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX.
Using
this
point
of
view,
we
apply
the
Comparison
Theorem
to
construct
a
global/Arakelov-theoretic
analogue
for
elliptic
curves
over
number
ﬁelds
of
the
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
of
a
family
of
elliptic
curves
over
a
geometric
base.
This
arithmetic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
will
be
discussed
in
detail
in
§1.4.
Suppose
that
E
is
an
elliptic
curve
over
a
ﬁeld
K
of
characteristic
zero.
Let
d
be
a
positive
integer,
and
η
∈
E(K)
a
torsion
point
of
order
not
dividing
d.
Write
def
L
=
OE
(d
·
[η])
SURVEY

for
the
line
bundle
on
E
corresponding
to
the
divisor
of
multiplicity
d
with
support
at
the
point
η.
Write
E†
→
E
for
the
universal
extension
of
the
elliptic
curve,
i.e.,
the
moduli
space
of
pairs
(M,
∇M
)
consisting
of
a
degree
zero
line
bundle
M
on
E,
together
with
a
connection
∇M
.
Thus,
E
†
is
an
aﬃne
torsor
on
E
under
the
module
ωE
of
invariant
diﬀerentials
on
E.
In
particular,
since
E
†
is
(Zariski
locally
over
E)
the
spectrum
of
a
polynomial
algebra
in
one
variable
with
coeﬃcients
in
the
sheaf
of
functions
on
E,
it
makes
sense
to
speak
of
the
“relative
degree
over
E”
–
which
we
refer
to
in
this
paper
as
the
torsorial
degree
–
of
a
function
on
E
†
.
Note
that
(since
we
are
in
characteristic
zero)
the
subscheme
E
†
[d]
⊆
E
†
of
d-torsion
points
of
E
†
maps
isomorphically
to
the
subscheme
E[d]
⊆
E
of
d-torsion
points
of
E.
Then
in
its
simplest
form,
the
main
theorem
of
[Mzk1]
states
the
following:
Theorem
Asimple
.
Let
E
be
an
elliptic
curve
over
a
ﬁeld
K
of
characteristic
zero.
Write
E
†
→
E
for
its
universal
extension.
Let
d
be
a
positive
integer,
and
def
η
∈
E(K)
a
torsion
point
whose
order
does
not
divide
d.
Write
L
=
OE
(d
·
[η]).
Then
the
natural
map
Γ(E
†
,
L)<d
→
L|E
†
[d]
given
by
restricting
sections
of
L
over
E
†
whose
torsorial
degree
is
<
d
to
the
dtorsion
points
E
†
[d]
⊆
E
†
is
a
bijection
between
K-vector
spaces
of
dimension
d2
.
The
remainder
of
the
main
theorem
essentially
consists
of
specifying
precisely
how
one
must
modify
the
integral
structure
of
Γ(E
†
,
L)<d
over
more
general
bases
in
order
to
obtain
an
isomorphism
at
the
ﬁnite
and
inﬁnite
primes
of
a
number
ﬁeld,
as
well
as
for
degenerating
elliptic
curves.
Let
us
ﬁrst
consider
the
integral
structures
on
the
left-hand
(de
Rham
side)
of
the
isomorphism
of
Theorem
Asimple
necessary
to
make
this
isomorphism
extend
to
an
isomorphism
at
ﬁnite
primes
and
for
degenerating
elliptic
curves
(i.e.,
as
the
“q-parameter”
goes
to
zero).
These
integral
structures
may
be
described
as
follows.
Let
us
work
over
a
formal
neighborhood
of
the
point
at
inﬁnity
on
the
moduli
stack
of
elliptic
curves
—
i.e.,
say,
the
spectrum
of
a
ring
of
power
series
of
the
form
def
1
S
=
Spec(O[[q
N
]])
where
O
is
a
Dedekind
domain
of
mixed
characteristic,
q
an
indeterminate,
and
N
a
positive
integer.
Write
S
for
the
completion
of
S
with
respect
to
the
q-adic
topology,
and
E
→
S
for
the
tautological
degenerating
elliptic
curve
(more
precisely:
one-dimensional
semi-abelian
scheme),
with
“q-parameter”
equal
to
q.
Then
we
have
natural
isomorphisms

introducing
certain

Theorem
A.
(The
Hodge-Arakelov
Comparison
Isomorphism)
If
one
equips
the
left-hand
side
(de
Rham
side)
of
the
restriction
morphism
of
Theorem
Asimple
with
the
“étale
integral
structure”
and
“Gaussian

just
discussed,
then
this
restriction
morphism
becomes
an
isomorphism
over
the
entire
moduli
stack
(Mell
)Z
,
except
possibly
over
the
schematic
intersection
of
the
torsion
point
η
with
the
scheme
E[d]
⊆
E
of
d-torsion
points.
Moreover,
at
archimedean
primes,
the
left
and
right
hand
sides
of
this
restriction
morphism
admit
natural
Hermitian
metrics
with
respect
to
which
the
deviation
of
the
restriction
morphism
from
being
an
isometry
may
be
estimated
using
Hermite,
Legendre,
and
binomial
coeﬃcient
polynomials

well
as

Before
continuing,
we
remark
that
the
factor
of
8d
poles
in
the
exponent
may
be
justiﬁed
by
the
following
calculation:
On
the
one
hand,
if
one
thinks
in
terms
of
degrees
of
vector
bundles
on
(Mell
)C
,
the
degree
of
the
left-hand
side
of
the
comparison
isomorphism
(without
Gaussian
poles!)
goes
roughly
as

is
a
symbol
that
stands
for
the
element
in
Pic((Mell

)
deﬁned
by
the
divisor
at
inﬁnity.
(It
turns
out
that
the
contribution
to
the
degree
by
the
line
bundle
L
is
negligible.)
On
the
other
hand,

is

Since
the
In
other
words,
the
factor
of
8d
restriction
of
L
to
the
torsion
points
is
(essentially)
a
“torsion
line
bundle”
(i.e.,
some
tensor
power
of
it
is
trivial),
the
degree
of
the
range
of
the
evaluation
map
is

zero
–
i.e.,
the
factor
of

is
just
enough
to
make
the
degrees
of
the
domain
and
range
of
the
evaluation
map
of
Theorem
A
equal
(which
is
natural,
since
we
want
this
evaluation
map
to
be
an
isomorphism).
In
fact,
It
turns
out
that
the
original
proof
(cf.
[Mzk1],
Chapter
VI,
§3)
of
the
characteristic
zero
portion
of
Theorem
A
(i.e.,
Theorem
Asimple
),
is
based
on
precisely
this
sort
of
“summation
of
degrees”
argument.
6
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
In
this
proof,
however,
in
order
to
get
an
exact
isomorphism,
it
is
necessary
to
compute
all
the
degrees
involved
precisely.
This
computation
requires
a
substantial
amount
of
work
(involving,
for
instance,
the
theory
of
[Zh])
and
is
carried
out
in
[Mzk1],
Chapters
IV,
V,
VI.
An
alternative
—
and,
in
the
opinion
of
the
author,
much
simpler
and
more
elegant
(albeit
somewhat
less
explicit!)
—
proof
of
the
characteristic
zero
portion
of
Theorem
A
using
characteristic
p
methods
(i.e.,
“Frobenius
and
Verschiebung”)
is
given
in
[Mzk5].
On
the
other
hand,
the
key
point
of
the
archimedean
portion
of
Theorem
A
is
the
comparison
of
what
we
refer
to
as
the
étale
and
de
Rham
metrics
||
∼
||et
,
||
∼
||DR
(which
are
naturally
deﬁned
on
the
range
and
domain
of
the
comparison
isomorphism,
respectively).
Unfortunately,
we
are
unable
to
prove
a
simple
sharp
result
that
they
always
coincide
(relative
to
the
comparison
isomorphism).
Instead,
we
choose
three
natural
“domains
of
investigation”
–
which
we
refer
to
as
models
–
where
we
estimate
the
diﬀerence
between
these
two
metrics
using
a
particular
system
of
functions
which
are
well-adapted
to
the
domain
of
investigation
in
question.
One
of
the
most
important
features
of
these
three
models
is
that
they
each
have
natural
scaling
factors
associated
to
them.
The
three
models,
along
with
their
natural
scaling
factors,
and
natural
domains
of
applicability
are
as
follows:
1
Hermite
Model
(scaling
factor
=
d
2
)
:
nondegenerating
E,
ﬁxed
r
<
d
Legendre
Model
(scaling
factor
=
d)
:
nondegenerating
E,
varying
r
<
d
Binomial
Model
(scaling
factor
=
1)
:
degenerating
E
It
is
interesting
to
observe
that
the
exponents
appearing
in
these
scaling
factors,
i.e.,
0,
12
,
1,
which
we
refer
to
as
slopes,
are
precisely
the
same
as
the
slopes
that
appear
when
one
considers
the
action
of
Frobenius
on
the
crystalline
cohomology
of
an
elliptic
curve
at
a
ﬁnite
prime
–
cf.
the
discussions
at
the
end
of
[Mzk1],
Chapter
VII,
§3,
6,
for
more
on
this
analogy.

Technical
Roots
Let
K
be
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
of
characteristic
0.
Let
E
be
an
elliptic
curve
over
K.
Let
L
be
the
line
bundle
of
Theorem
Asimple
.
Then
instead
of
considering
sections
of
L
over
E
†
,
one
can
consider
sections
of
L
over
E.
Such
sections
may
be
restricted
to
L|E[d]
.
Moreover,
by
the
theory
of
algebraic
theta
functions
(cf.
[Mumf1,2,3]),
the
restriction
L|E[d]
of
L
to
the
d-torsion
points
E[d]
⊆
E
admits
a
canonical
trivialization
L|E[d]
∼
=
L|0E
⊗K
OE[d]
(where
0E
∈
E(K)
is
the
zero
element)
—
at
least
when
d
is
odd.
Thus,
by
composing
the
restriction
morphism
with
this
trivialization,
we
obtain
a
morphism
(as
in
[Mumf1,2,3]):

on
E[d].
These
functions
are
Mumford’s
“algebraic
theta
functions.”
Now
let
us
observe
that
dimK
(Γ(E,
L))
=
d,
while
dimK
(L|0E
⊗K
OE[d]
)
=
d2
.
That
is
to
say,
Mumford’s
theory
only
addresses
a
fraction
(more
precisely:
d1
)
of
the
functions
in
L|0E
⊗K
OE[d]
.
Thus,
it
is
natural
to
ask:
Is
there
a
natural
extension
of
Mumford’s
theory
that
allows
one
to
give
meaning
to
all
the
functions
of
L|0E
⊗K
OE[d]
as
some
sort
of
“global”
sections
of
L?
Theorem
Asimple
provides
a
natural,
aﬃrmative
answer
to
this
question:
i.e.,
it
states
that
these
functions
may
be
interpreted
naturally
as
the
sections
of
L
over
the
universal
extension
E
†
of
torsorial
degree
<
d.
In
more
classical
terms,
to
consider
the
universal
extension
amounts
essentially
to
considering
the
derivatives
of
(classical)
theta
functions
(cf.,
e.g.,
[Katz1],
Appendix
C).
For
instance,
if
one
takes
K
=
C,
and
writes
def
θτ
(z)
=

2
eπiτ
·n
·
e2πiz·n
n∈Z
def
for
the
“standard
theta
function”
(where
z
∈
C,
τ
∈
H
=
{w
∈
C
|
Im(w)
>
0}),
then
up
to
the
operation
of
taking
the
Fourier
expansion,
this
theta
function
is
2
∂
)
·
θτ
(z)
(where
P
(−)
is
a
essentially
a
“Gaussian
eπiτ
·n
,”
and
its
derivatives
P
(
∂z
polynomial
with
coeﬃcients
in
C)
are
given
by
polynomial
multiples
of
(which
are
equivalent
to
derivatives
of
)
the
Gaussian:
2
P
(2πi
·
n)
·
eπiτ
·n
Just
as
theta
functions
are
the
“fundamental
functions
on
an
elliptic
curve”
(more
precisely:
generate
the
space
of
sections
of
L
over
E),
these
derivatives
are
the
“fundamental
functions
on
the
universal
extension
of
the
elliptic
curve”
(more
precisely:
generate
the
space
of
sections
of
L
over
E
†
).
This
point
of
view
is
discussed
in
more
detail
in
[Mzk1],
Chapter
III,
§5,
6,
7;
[Mzk1],
Chapter
VII,
§6.
As
one
knows
from
elementary
analysis,
the
most
natural
polynomial
multiples/derivatives
of
a
Gaussian
are
those
given
by
the
Hermite
polynomials.
It
is
thus
natural
to
expect
that
the
Hermite
polynomials
should
appear
naturally
in
the
portion
of
this
theory
concerning
the
behavior
of
the
comparison
isomorphism
at
archimedean
primes.
This
intuition
is
made
rigorous
in
the
theory
of
[Mzk1],
Chapters
IX,
X.
In
fact,
more
generally:
The
essential
model
that
permeates
the
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
of
elliptic
curves
is
that
of
the
Gaussian
and
its
derivatives.
This
8
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
model
may
be
seen
especially
in
the
“Gaussian
poles,”
as
well
as
in
the
“Hermite
model”
at
the
inﬁnite
prime
(cf.
§1.1,
Theorem
A).
In
the
classical
theory
over
C,
the
most
basic
derivative
of
the
theta
function
is
the
so-called
Weierstrass
zeta
function
(cf.
[Katz1],
Appendix
C).
It
should
thus
not
be
surprising
to
the
reader
that
various
generalizations
of
the
Weierstrass
zeta
function
–
which
we
refer
to
as
Schottky-Weierstrass
zeta
functions
(cf.
[Mzk1],
Chapter
III,
§6,
7)
–
play
a
fundamental
role
in
[Mzk1].
So
far,
in
the
above
discussion,
we
concentrated
on
smooth
elliptic
curves.
On
the
other
hand,
when
one
wishes
to
consider
degenerating
elliptic
curves,
Zhang
has
constructed
a
theory
of
metrized
line
bundles
on
such
degenerating
elliptic
curves
(cf.
[Zh]).
In
this
theory,
one
can
consider
the
curvatures
of
such
metrized
line
bundles,
as
well
as
intersection
numbers
between
two
metrized
line
bundles
in
a
fashion
entirely
similar
to
Arakelov
intersection
theory.
Using
Zhang’s
theory
of
metrized
line
bundles,
it
is
not
diﬃcult
to
extend
Mumford’s
theory
of
algebraic
theta
functions
in
a
natural
fashion
to
metrized
ample
line
bundles
on
degenerating
elliptic
curves
(cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IV,
§5,
for
more
details).
Unfortunately,
however,
just
as
Mumford’s
theory
only
addresses
sections
over
the
original
elliptic
curve
(as
opposed
to
over
the
universal
extension,
as
discussed
above),
Zhang’s
theory
also
only
deals
with
the
theory
of
metrized
line
bundles
over
the
original
(degenerating)
elliptic
curve.
Thus,
it
is
natural
to
ask
whether
one
can
generalize
Theorem
Asimple
to
the
case
of
degenerating
elliptic
curves
in
such
a
way
that
the
resulting
generalization
of
the
portion
of
Γ(E
†
,
L)
arising
from
sections
over
E
is
compatible
with
Zhang’s
theory
of
metrized
line
bundles
(and
their
sections)
over
E.
In
other
words,
it
is
natural
to
ask:
Can
one
“de
Rham-ify”
the
theory
of
[Zh],
so
that
it
addresses
the
“metric”
behavior
of
sections
of
L
not
only
over
E,
but
over
E
†
,
as
well?
An
aﬃrmative
answer
to
this
question
is
given
by
the
theory
of
Gaussian
poles,
or
“analytic
torsion
at
the
divisor
at
inﬁnity”
–
cf.
[Mzk1],
Chapters
V,
VI.
Another
way
to
view
the
relation
to
Zhang’s
theory
is
the
following.
One
consequence
of
the
theory
of
[Zh]
is
the
construction
of
a
natural
“metric”
(or
integral
structure)
on
the
space
ωE
of
invariant
diﬀerentials
on
a
(degenerating)
elliptic
curve.
If
we
regard
ωE
as
a
line
bundle
on
the
compactiﬁed
moduli
space
of
elliptic
curves,
then
Zhang’s
“admissible
metric”
on
ωE
essentially
amounts
to
1
·
∞)
(where
∞
is
the
divisor
at
inﬁnity
of
the
the
(metrized)
line
bundle
ωE
(−
12
moduli
space),
i.e.,
the
line
bundle
ωE
with
integral
structure
at
inﬁnity
modiﬁed
1
by
tensoring
with
O(−
12
·
∞).
Moreover,
it
follows
from
Zhang’s
theory
that
there
is
a
natural
trivialization
ωE
(−
1
·
∞)
∼
=O
12
SURVEY
OF

THEORY
9
of
this
metrized
line
bundle
over
the
moduli
space.
The
12-th
tensor
power
of
this
trivialization
is
the
cuspidal
modular
form
usually
denoted
“Δ”
([KM],
Chapter
8,
§8.1).
Similarly,
Theorem
A
states
that
by
allowing
“Gaussian
poles”
in
the
sections
of
Γ(E
†
,
L),
one
gets
a
natural
isomorphism
between
Γ(E
†
,
L)
(with
this
modiﬁed
integral
structure)
and
a
vector
bundle
which
is
trivial
(in
characteristic
zero)
over
some
ﬁnite
log
étale
covering
of
the
compactiﬁed
moduli
(log)
stack
of
elliptic
curves.
That
is
to
say,
One
may
regard
the
theory
of
Gaussian
poles/analytic
torsion
at
the
divisor
at
inﬁnity
in
Theorem
A
as
a
sort
of
“GL2

of
the

of

(i.e.,

—
or,
alternatively,
a
GL2
-analogue
of
the
modular
form
Δ.
Note:
The
reason
that
we
mention
“GL2
”
is
that
the
vector
bundle
on
the
“étale
side”
of
the
comparison
isomorphism
of
Theorem
A
arises
naturally
(at
least
in
characteristic

from
a

of

whereas
the

ωE

naturally
corresponds
to
an
abelian

(i.e.,
a

Gm

is,

of

(which

Let

whose

(via

for

We

call

the

Of

in
the

it
is
natural
to
“formally

to
S
the

of

i.e.,
EK

K
is
an

over

with
semi-stable

everywhere.
Then
E
deﬁnes
a

(Mell

10
SHINICHI

to
the
compactiﬁed
moduli
stack
of

elliptic

over
Z.
It
is
natural
to
endow
S
with
the
log
structure
arising
from
the
set
of
closed
points
at
which
log
E
→
S
has
bad
reduction.
Then
α
extends
to
a
morphism
αlog
:
S
log
→
(Mell
)Z
in
the
logarithmic
category.
Now,
in
the
function
ﬁeld
case,
if
we
diﬀerentiate
α,
we
obtain
the
KodairaSpencer
morphism
of
E

(where

is
the
restriction
to
the
identity
section
of
E
→
S
of
the
relative
cotangent

of

over

Since
ωE
is
naturally
the
pull-back
via
α
of
an
ample
line
bundle
on
(Mell

,
and
κE
is
typically
nonzero
(for

it

always
nonzero
if
K

zero
and
E
→
S
is
not
isotrivial
(i.e.,
trivial
after
restriction
to
a
ﬁnite

of

the
existence
of
the
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
κE
gives
rise
to
a
bound
on
the
height
of
E
→
S
by
the
degree
of
ΩS

.
The
thrust
of
a
family
of
conjectures
due
to
Vojta
(cf.
[Lang],
[Vojta])
is
that
this
bound
(or
at
least,
a
bound
roughly
similar
to
this
bound)
in
the
geometric
case
(i.e.,
the
case
when
K
is
a
function
ﬁeld)
also
holds
in
the
“arithmetic
case”
(i.e.,
the
case
when
K
is
a
number
ﬁeld).
Thus,
In
order
to
prove
Vojta’s
Conjecture
in
the
arithmetic
case,
it
is
natural
to
attempt
to
construct
some
sort
of
arithmetic
analogue
of
the
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism.
Indeed,
this
point
of
view
of
approaching
the
veriﬁcation
of
some
inequality
by
ﬁrst
trying
to
construct
“the
theory
underlying
the
inequality”
is
reminiscent
of
the
approach
to
proving
the
Weil
Conjectures
(which
may
be
thought
of
as
inequalities
concerning
the
number
of
rational
points
of
varieties
over
ﬁnite
ﬁelds)
by
attempting
to
construct
a
“Weil
cohomology
theory”
for
varieties
over
ﬁnite
ﬁelds
which
has
enough
“good
properties”
to
allow
a
natural
proof
of
the
Weil
Conjectures.
Of
course,
if
one
tries
to
construct
any
sort
of
naive
analogue
of
the
KodairaSpencer
morphism
in
the
arithmetic
case,
one
immediately
runs
into
a
multitude
of
fundamental
obstacles.
In
some
sense,
these
obstacles
revolve
around
the
fact
that
the
ring
of
rational
integers
Z
does
not
admit
“a
ﬁeld
of
absolute
constants”
F1
⊆
Z.
If
such
a
ﬁeld
of
absolute
constants
existed,
then
one
could
consider
“absolute
diﬀerentials
ΩZ/F1
,”
or
“ΩOK
/F1
”
Moreover,
since
moduli
spaces
tend
to
be
rather
absolute
and
fundamental
objects,
it
is
natural
to
imagine
that
if
one
had
a
ﬁeld
of
absolute
constants
“F1
,”
then
(Mell
)Z
should
descend
naturally
to
an
object
(Mell
)F1
over
F1
,
so
that
one
could
diﬀerentiate
the
classifying
morphism
α
:
S
→
(Mell
)Z
in
the
arithmetic
case,
as
well,
to
obtain
an
arithmetic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism

and
then
use
this
arithmetic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
to
prove
Vojta’s
Conjecture
concerning
the
heights
of
elliptic
curves.
(Note:
In
this
case,
Vojta’s
Conjecture
is
also
referred
to
as
“Szpiro’s
Conjecture.”)
Unfortunately,
this
sort
of
“absolute
ﬁeld
of
constants
F1
”
does
not,
of
course,
exist
in
any
naive
sense.
Thus,
it
is
natural
to
look
for
a
more
indirect,
abstract
approach.
In
the
geometric
case,
when
k
=
C,
the
algebraic
curve
S
deﬁnes
a
Riemann
surface
S
an
.
Let
us
write
US
⊆
S
for
the
open
subobject
where
the
log
structure
of
S
log
is
trivial.
Then
the
ﬁrst
singular
cohomology
module
of
the
ﬁbers
of
E
→
S
naturally
forms
a
local
system
1
Hsing
(E/S,
Z)
on
the
Riemann
surface
USan
.
One
the
other
hand,
the
ﬁrst
de
Rham
cohomology
module
of
the
ﬁbers
of
E
→
S
forms
a
rank
two
vector
bundle
1
HDR
(E/S,
OE
)
on
USan
.
This
de
Rham
cohomology
admits
a
Hodge
ﬁltration,
which
may
be
thought
of
as
a
natural
exact
sequence:
1
0
→
ωE
→
HDR
(E/S,
OE
)
→
τE
→
0
1
(E/S,
OE
)
on
USan
admits
a
connection
∇DR
—
Moreover,
this
vector
bundle
HDR
called
the
Gauss-Manin
connection
—
which
allows
one
to
diﬀerentiate
sections
of
1
HDR
(E/S,
OE
).
Using
this
connection
∇DR
to
diﬀerentiate
the
Hodge
ﬁltration
gives
rise
to
a
natural
morphism
ΘS
log
/k
→
τE⊗2
(where
ΘS
log
/k
is
the
dual
to
ΩS
log
/k
)
which
is
dual
to
the
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
κE
.
Thus,
Another
way
to
think
of
our
search
for
“F1
”
or
“a
notion
of
absolute
diﬀerentiation”
is
as
the
search
for
an
arithmetic
analogue
of
the
Gauss-Manin
connection
∇DR
on
the
de
Rham
cohomology
1
HDR
(E/S,
OE
).
This
is
the
ﬁrst
step
towards
raising
our
search
for
an
arithmetic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
to
a
more
abstract
level.
Next,
let
us
recall
that
the
de
Rham
isomorphism
deﬁnes
a
natural
isomorphism
12

over

Moreover,
the

of

)
1
deﬁned
(via
this
isomorphism)
by
sections
of
Hsing
(E/S,

are
horizontal
for
∇DR
.
Thus,
we
conclude
that:
To
construct
the
Gauss-Manin
connection
∇DR
,
it
is
enough
to
know
the
de
Rham
isomorphism
between
de
Rham
and
singular
cohomology.
The
de
Rham
isomorphism
is
a
special
case
of
the
general
notion
of
a
Comparison
Isomorphism
between
de
Rham
and
singular/étale
cohomology.
In
the
last
few
decades,
this
sort
of
Comparison
Isomorphism
has
been
constructed
over
p-adic
bases,
as
well
(cf.,
e.g.,
[Falt1,2],
[Hyodo]).
In
the
arithmetic
case,
we
would
like
to
construct
some
sort
of
analogue
of
the
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
over
S
which
also
has
natural
integrality
properties
at
the
archimedean
places,
as
well
(since
we
would
like
to
use
it
conclude
inequalities
concerning
the
height
of
the
elliptic
curve
EK
).
Put
another
way,
we
would
like
to
construct
some
sort
of
arithmetic
KodairaSpencer
morphism
in
the
context
of
Arakelov
theory.
Thus,
in
summary,
the
above
discussion
suggests
that:
In
order
to
construct
this
sort
of
arithmetic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism,
a
natural
approach
is
to
attempt
to
construct
some
sort

The
construction
of
such
an

Theorem
is
the
main
goal
of
the
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
of
elliptic
curves.
To
a
certain
extent,
this

is
achieved
by
Theorem
A
(cf.
§1.1).
For

the

of
Theorem
A
is

to

and
p-adic

Isomorphisms,
we
refer
to
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX.
Unfortunately,
however,
for
various
technical
reasons,
the
arithmetic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
that
naturally
arises
from
Theorem
A
is
not
well
enough
understood
at

of

its

(for

on

cf.
§1.5.1

In
the
remainder
of
the
present
§1.3,
we
would
like
to
explain
in
detail
how
we
were
led
to
Theorem

as
a
global,
Arakelov-theoretic
analogue
of
the
well-known
“local

is
to
regard
such
objects
as

consequences
of
a
“global
Hodge
theory,”
or
Comparison
Isomorphism
between
the
de
Rham
and
étale
cohomologies
of
an
elliptic
curve.
The
question
then
arises:
Just
what
form
should
such
a
Global
Comparison
Isomorphism
—
i.e.,
in
suggestive
notation

HDR
(E)
⊗
??
∼

⊗
??
=

—
take?
For
instance,
over
C,
such
a
comparison
isomorphism
exists
naturally
over
C,
i.e.,
when
one
takes
??
=
C.
In
the
p-adic
case,
one
must
introduce
rings
of
p-adic
periods
such
as
BdR
,
Bcrys
(cf.,
e.g.,
[Falt2])
in
order
to
obtain
such
an
isomorphism.
Thus,
we
would
like
to
know
over
if
there
is
some
sort
of
natural
“ring
of
global
periods”
over
which
we
may
expect
to
obtain
our
global
comparison
isomorphism.
In
fact,
in
the
comparison
isomorphism
obtained
in
[Mzk1]
(cf.
§1.1,
Theorem
A),
unlike
the
situation
over
complex
and
p-adic
bases,
we
do
not
work
over
some
“global
ring
of
periods.”
Instead,
the
situation
is
somewhat
more
complicated.
Roughly
speaking,
what
we
end
up
doing
is
the
following:
In
the
Hodge-Arakelov
Comparison
Isomorphism,
we
obtain
a
comparison
isomorphism
between
the
de
Rham
and
étale
cohomologies
of
an
elliptic
curve
by
considering
functions
on
the
de
Rham
and
étale
cohomologies
of
the
elliptic
curve
and
then
constructing
an
isomorphism
between
the
two
resulting
function
spaces
which
is
(essentially)
an
isometry
with
respect
to
natural
metrics
on
these
function
spaces
at
all
the
primes
of
the
base.
Indeed,
for
instance
over
a
number
ﬁeld,
the
de
Rham
cohomology
and
étale
cohomology
are
ﬁnite
modules
over
very
diﬀerent
sorts
of
rings
(i.e.,
the
ring
of
integers
of
the
number
ﬁeld
in
the
de
Rham
case;
the
proﬁnite
completion
of
Z,
or
one
of
its
quotients
in
the
étale
case),
and
it
is
diﬃcult
to
imagine
the
existence
of
a
natural
“global
arithmetic
ring”
containing
both
of
these
two
types
of
rings.
(Note
here
that
unlike
the
case
with
Shimura
varieties,
the
adèles
are
not
a
natural
choice
here
for
a
number
of
reasons.
Indeed,
to
consider
the
adèles
here
roughly
amounts
to
simply
forming
the
direct
product
of
the
various
local
(i.e.,
complex
and
p-adic)
comparison
isomorphisms,
which
is
not
very
interesting
in
the
sense
that
such
a
simple
direct
product
does
not
result
in
any
natural
global
structures.)
Thus:
The
idea
here
is
to
abandon
the
hope
of
obtaining
a
global
linear
isomorphism
between
the
de
Rham
and
étale
cohomology
modules,
and
instead
to
look
for
an
isomorphism
(as
mentioned
above)
between
the
corresponding
function
spaces
which
does
not
necessarily
arise
from
a
linear
morphism
between
modules.

SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
In
the
present
§,
we
explain
how
we
were
led
to
look
for
such
a
“function-theoretic
comparison
isomorphism,”
while
in
§1.3.3
below,
we
examine
the
meaning
of
the
nonlinearity
of
this
sort
of
comparison
isomorphism.
In
order
to
understand
the
motivating
circumstances
that
naturally
lead
to
the
introduction
of
this
sort
of
function-theoretic
point
of
view,
we
must
ﬁrst
return
to
the
discussion
of
the
case
over
the
complexes
in
§1.3.1
above.
Thus,
in
the
following
discussion,
we
use
the
notation
of
the
discussion
of
the
complex
case
in
§1.3.1.
One
more
indirect
way
to
think
about
the
existence
of
the
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
is
the
following.
Recall
the
exact
sequence
1
0
→
ωE
→
HDR
(E/S,
OE
)
→
τE
→
0
which
in
fact
exists
naturally
over
S
an
.
The
Gauss-Manin
connection
∇DR
acts
on
the
middle
term
of
this
exact
sequence
(as
a
connection
with
logarithmic
poles
at
the
points
of
bad
reduction),
but
does
not
preserve
the
image
of
ωE
.
One
important
consequence
of
this
fact
is
that:
(If
one
imposes
certain
“natural
logarithmic
conditions”
on
the
splitting
at
points
of
bad
reduction,
then)
this
exact
sequence
does
not
split.
Indeed,
if
this
exact
sequence
split,
then
one
could
use
this
splitting
to
obtain
a
connection
on
ωE
induced
by
∇DR
.
Moreover,
if
the
“natural
logarithmic
conditions”
are
satisﬁed,
it
would
follow
that
this
connection
on
ωE
has
zero
monodromy
at
the
points
of
bad
reduction,
i.e.,
that
the
connection
is
regular
over
all
of
S
an
.
But
since
ωE
is
the
pull-back
to
S
of
an
ample
line
bundle
on
(Mell
)Z
,
it
follows
(so
long
as
E
→
S
is
not
isotrivial)
that
deg(ωE
)
=
0,
hence
that
the
line
bundle
ωE
cannot
admit
an
everywhere
regular
connection.
That
is,
we
obtain
a
contradiction.
Another
(essentially
equivalent)
way
to
think
about
the
relationship
between
the
fact
that
the
above
exact
sequence
does
not
split
and
the
existence
of
the
⊗2
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
is
the
following.
If
one
considers
the
ωE
-torsor
of
splittings
of
the
above
exact
sequence
(together
with
the
“natural
logarithmic
conditions”
at
the
points
of
bad
reduction),
we
obtain
a
class
⊗2
)
η
∈
Hc1
(S,
ωE
where
the
subscript
“c”
stands
for
“cohomology
with
compact
support.”
(The
reason
that
we
get
a
class
with
compact
support
is
because
of
the
“natural
logarithmic
conditions”
at
the
points
of
bad
reduction.)
On
the
other
hand,
if
we
apply
the
functor
Hc1
(−)
to
the
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism,
we
obtain
a
morphism
⊗2
)
→
Hc1
(S,
ΩS
log
/k
)
=
Hc1
(S,
ΩS/k
)
∼
Hc1
(S,
ωE
=k
Moreover,
the
image
of
η
under
this
morphism
can
easily
be
shown
to
be
the
element
of
Hc1
(S,
ΩS/k
)
∼
=
k
which
is
the
degree
of
the
classifying
morphism
α
:
S
→
(Mell
)C
,
SURVEY
OF
HODGE-ARAKELOV
THEORY
15
i.e.,
deg(α)
∈
Z
⊆
C
=
k,
which
is
nonzero
(so
long
as
E
→
S
is
not
isotrivial).
This
implies
that
η
is
nonzero.
Thus,
in
summary,
An
indirect
way
to
“witness
the
existence
of
the
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism”
is
to
observe
that
the
above
exact
sequence
does
not
⊗2
split,
i.e.,
that
the
ωE
-torsor
of
splittings
of
this
sequence
is
nontrivial.
This
point
of
view
is
discussed
in
more
detail
in
[Mzk7],
Introduction,
§2.3.
Also,
we
observe
that
this
nonsplitting
of
the
above
exact
sequence
may
also
be
regarded
as
a

OE
),

sort
of

(HDR
This
type

of

is
referred
to
as

The

Now
let
us
return
to
the
arithmetic
case.
In
this
case,
S
=
Spec(OK
)
(where
OK
is
the
ring
of
integers
of
a
number
ﬁeld
K).
Moreover,
we
have
a
natural
exact
sequence
of
OK
-modules:

(E/S,
OE
)
→
τE
→
0
0
→
ωE
→

16
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
which
extends
naturally
to
an
exact
sequence
of
OK
-modules
with
Hermitian
metrics
at
the
inﬁnite
primes,
i.e.,
an
exact
sequence
of
arithmetic
vector
bundles
on
S
(where
S
denotes
the
formal
union
of
S
with
the
set
of
inﬁnite
primes
of
K)
in
the
sense
of
Arakelov
theory.
Then
one
can
consider
whether
or
not
this
exact
sequence
of
arithmetic
vector
bundles
splits.
Moreover,
just
as
in
the
complex
case,
one
can
think
of
this
issue
as
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
a
certain
Arakelov-theoretic
⊗2
-torsor
splits.
(The
notion
and
basic
properties
of
torsors
in
Arakelov-theory
ωE
are
discussed
in
[Mzk1],
Chapter
I.)
Thus,
One
way
to
regard
the
issue
of
constructing
an
arithmetic
KodairaSpencer
morphism
is
as
the
issue
of
constructing
a
theory
that
⊗2
proves
that/explains
why
this
Arakelov-theoretic
ωE
-torsor
does
not
split.
Indeed,
the
nonsplitting
of
this
torsor
is
very
closely
related
to
the
Conjectures
of
Vojta
and
Szpiro
—
in
fact,
the
existence
of
(for
instance,
an
inﬁnite
number
of)
counterexamples
to
these
conjectures
would
imply
(in
an
inﬁnite
number
of
cases)
the
splitting
of
this
torsor
(cf.
[Mzk1],
Chapter
I,
Theorem
2.4;
[Mzk1],
Chapter
I,
§4).

Fig.
2:
The
non-split
case.
From
a
more
elementary
point
of
view,
the
nonsplitting
of
this
torsor
may
be
thought
of
in
the
following
fashion.
First
of
all,
an
arithmetic
vector
bundle
over
S
SURVEY
OF
HODGE-ARAKELOV
THEORY
17
may
be
thought
of
as
an
(OK
-)
lattice
in
a
real
or
complex
vector
space.
Thus,
for
1
(E/S,
OE
)
as
a
lattice
in
R2
,
instance,
in
the
case
K
=
Q,
one
may
think
of
HDR
while
the
arithmetic
line
bundles
ωE
and
τE
may
be
thought
of
as
lattices
in
R.
In
the
case
of
arithmetic
line
bundles,
to
say
that
the
degree
of
the
arithmetic
line
bundle
(cf.
[Mzk1],
Chapter
I,
§1)
is
large
(respectively,
small)
amounts
to
saying
that
the
points
of
the
lattice
are
rather
densely
(respectively,
sparsely)
distributed.
Note
that
since
ωE
is
the
pull-back
to
S
of
an
ample
line
bundle
(Mell
)Z
,
its
degree
tends
to
be
rather
large.
Thus,
to
say
that
the
torsor
in
question
splits
is
to
say
1
that
HDR
(E/S,
OE
)
looks
rather
like
the
lattice
of
Fig.
1,
i.e.,
it
is
dense
in
one
direction
and
sparse
in
another
(roughly
orthogonal)
direction.
We
would
like
to
1
(E/S,
OE
)
looks
more
like
the
lattice
in
Fig.
2,
i.e.:
show
that
HDR
1
We
would
like
to
show
that
the
lattice
corresponding
to
HDR
(E/S,
OE
)
is
roughly
equidistributed
in
all
directions.
Since
we
are
thinking
about
comparison
isomorphisms,
it
is
thus
tempting
to
think
of
the
comparison
isomorphism
as
something
which
guarantees
that
the
“distribu1
tion
of
matter”
in
the
lattice
HDR
(E/S,
OE
)
is
as
even
in
all
directions
as
the
“distribution
of
matter”
in
the
étale
cohomology
of
E.
Also,
it
is
natural
to
think
of
the
“distribution
of
matter
issues”
involving
the
étale
cohomology,
or
torsion
points,
of
E
as
being
related
to
the
action
of
Galois.
(The
action
of
Galois
on
the
torsion
points
is
discussed
in
[Mzk4].)
Thus,
in
summary:
It
is
natural
to
expect
that
the
global
comparison
isomorphism
should
be
some
sort
of
equivalence
between
“distributions
of
matter”
in
the
de
Rham
and
étale
cohomologies
of
an
elliptic
curve.
Typically,
in
analytic
number
theory,
probability
theory,
and
other
ﬁeld
of
mathematics
where
“distributions
of
matter”
must
be
measured
precisely,
it
is
customary
to
measure
them
by
thinking
about
functions
—
i.e.,
so-called
“test
functions”
—
(and
the
resulting
function
spaces)
on
the
spaces
where
these
distributions
of
matter
occur.
It
is
for
this
reason
that
the
author
was
led
to
the
conclusion
that:
The
proper
formulation
for
a
global
comparison
isomorphism
should
be
some
sort
of
isometric
(for
metrics
at
all
the
primes
of
a
number
ﬁeld)
isomorphism
between
spaces
of
functions
on
the
de
Rham
and
étale
cohomologies
of
an
elliptic
curve.
This
is
precisely
what
is
obtained
in
Theorem
A.
§1.3.3
The
Meaning
of
Nonlinearity
In
§1.3.2
above,
we
saw
that
one
of
the
central
ideas
of
[Mzk1]
is
that
to
obtain
a
“global
Hodge
theory,”
one
must
sacriﬁce
linearity
=
additivity,
and
instead
look
for
isometric
isomorphisms
between
spaces
of
functions
on
the
de
Rham
and
étale
18
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
cohomology.
Put
another
way,
this
approach
amounts
to
abandoning
the
idea
that
the
de
Rham
and
étale
cohomologies
are
modules,
and
instead
thinking
of
them
as
(nonlinear)
geometric
objects.
Thus,
one
appropriate
name
for
this
approach
might
be
“geometric
motive
theory.”
This
approach
contrasts
sharply
with
typical
approaches
to
the
“theory
of
motives”
or
to
“global
Hodge
theories”
which
tend
to
revolve
around
additivity/linearization,
and
involve
such
“linear”
techniques
as
the
introduction
of
derived
categories
that
contain
motives.
In
some
sense,
since
we
set
out
to
develop
a
global
Hodge
theory
in
the
context
of
Arakelov
theory,
the
nonlinearity
of
the
Comparison
Isomorphism
of
Theorem
A
is
perhaps
not
so
surprising:
Indeed,
many
objects
in
Arakelov
theory
which
are
analogues
of
“linear”
objects
in
usual
scheme
theory
become
“nonlinear”
when
treated
in
the
context
of
Arakelov
theory.
Perhaps
the
most
basic
example
of
this
phenomenon
is
the
fact
that
in
Arakelov
theory,
the
space
of
global
sections
of
an
arithmetic
line
bundle
is
not
closed
under
addition.
This
makes
it
diﬃcult
and
unnatural
(if
not
impossible)
to
do
homological
algebra
(e.g.,
involving
derived
categories)
in
the
context
of
Arakelov
theory.
Another
way
to
think
about
the
nonlinearity
of
the
Hodge-Arakelov
Comparison
Isomorphism
is
that
it
is
natural
considering
that
the
fundamental
algebraic
object
that
encodes
the
“symmetries
of
the
Gaussian,”
namely,
the
Heisenberg
algebra
—
i.e.,
the
Lie
algebra
generated
by
1,
x,
y,
and
the
relations
[x,
y]
=
1,
[x,
1]
=
[y,
1]
=
0
(the
étale
counterpart
of
which
is
the
theta
groups
of
Mumford)
—
is
closely
related
to
nonlinear
geometries.
In
the
ﬁeld
of
noncommutative
geometry,
the
object
that
represents
these
symmetries
is
known
as
the
noncommutative
torus.
Since
the
Gaussian
and
its
derivatives
lie
at
the
technical
heart
of
the
theory
of
[Mzk1],
it
is
thus
not
surprising
that
the
nonabelian
nature
of
the
symmetries
of
the
Gaussian
should
manifest
itself
in
the
theory.
In
fact,
in
the
portion
of
the
theory
of
[Mzk1]
at
archimedean
primes,
it
turns
out
that
the
Comparison
Isomorphism
in
some
sense
amounts
to
a
function-theoretic
splitting
of
the
exact
sequence
0
→
d
·
Z
→
Z
→
Z/d
·
Z
→
0,
i.e.,
a
function-theoretic
version
of
a
bijection
(Z/d
·
Z)
×
(d
·
Z)
∼
=Z
This
sort
of
splitting
is
somewhat
reminiscent
of
the
“splitting”
inherent
in
regarding
Z
as
being
some
sort
of
“polynomial
algebra
over
F1
.”
Moreover,
this
archimedean
portion
of
the
theory
is
also
(not
surprisingly)
closely
related
to
the
derivatives
of
the
Gaussian
and
the
symmetries
encoded
in
the
Heisenberg
algebra.
Thus,
in
summary:
It
is
as
if
the
symmetries/twist
inherent
in
the
inclusion
“F1
⊆
Z”
are
precisely
the
symmetries/twist
encoded
in
the
noncommutative
torus
(of
noncommutative
geometry).
We
refer
to
the
discussion
of
[Mzk1],
Chapter
VIII,
§0,
for
more
details
on
this
point
of
view.
SURVEY
OF
HODGE-ARAKELOV
THEORY

§1.3.4
Hodge
Theory
at
Finite
Resolution
So
far,
we
have
discussed
the
idea
that
the
appropriate
way
to
think
about
Comparison
Isomorphisms
is
to
regard
them
as
(isometric)
isomorphisms
between
spaces
of
functions
on
the
de
Rham
and
étale
cohomologies
of
an
elliptic
curve.
The
question
then
arises:
How
does
one
deﬁne
such
a
natural
isomorphism?
The
key
idea
here
is
the
following:
Comparison
Isomorphisms
should
be
deﬁned
as
evaluation
maps,
given
by
evaluating
functions
on
the
universal
extension
of
an
el×
1
(E,
OE
),”
i.e.,
a
kind
of
liptic
curve
—
which
is
a
sort
of
“HDR
de
Rham
cohomology
of
the
elliptic
curve
—
at
the
torsion
points
of
the
universal
extension
(which
may
naturally
be
identiﬁed
with
the
étale
cohomology
of
the
elliptic
curve).
In
fact,
one
of
the
main
observations
that
led
to
the
development
of
the
theory
of
[Mzk1]
is
the
following:
The
classical
Comparison
Isomorphisms
over
complex
and
p-adic
bases
may
be
formulated
precisely
as
evaluation
maps
of
certain
functions
on
the
universal
extension
at
the
torsion
points
(or
the
“singular
cohomology
analogue
of
torsion
points”)
of
the
universal
extension.
This
key
observation
is
discussed
in
detail
in
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX,
§1,
2.
In
the
complex
case,
it
amounts
to
an
essentially
trivial
reformulation
of
the
classical
theory.
Perhaps
the
best
way
to
summarize
this
reformulation
is
to
state
that
the
subspace
of
functions
on
the
“singular
cohomology
analogue
of
torsion
points”
arising
from
the
theta
functions
on
the
elliptic
curve
is
itself
a
sort
of
“function-theoretic”
representation
of
the
Hodge
ﬁltration
induced
(by
the
de
Rham
isomorphism)
on
the
singular
cohomology
with
complex
coeﬃcients
of
an
elliptic
curve.
In
fact,
this
observation
more
than
any
other
played
an
essential
role
in
convincing
the
author
that
(roughly
speaking)
“theta
functions
naturally
deﬁne
the
Comparison
Isomorphism”
(hence
that
any
global
Comparison
Isomorphism
should
involve
theta
functions).
In
the
p-adic
case,
this
“key
observation”
amounts
to
what
is
usually
referred
to
as
the
p-adic
period
map
(cf.,
e.g.,
[Coln],
[Colz1,2],
[Font],
[Wint];
the
beginning
of
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX,
§2)
of
elliptic
curves
(or
abelian
varieties).
Thus,
in
summary,
the
complex,
p-adic,
and
Hodge-Arakelov
Comparison
Isomorphisms
may
all
be
formulated
along
very
similar
lines,
i.e.,
as
evaluation
maps
of
functions
on
the
universal
extension
at
the
torsion
points
of
the
universal
extension.
Of
course,
the
diﬀerence
between
the
Hodge-Arakelov
Comparison
Isomorphism
and
its
local
(i.e.,
complex
and
p-adic)
counterparts
is
that
unlike
in
the
local
case,
where
the
spaces
of
torsion
points
involved
are
“completed
at
some
prime,”
in
the
Hodge-Arakelov
case,
we
work
with
a
discrete
set
of
torsion
points.
It
is
for
this
reason
that
we
ﬁnd
it
natural
to
think
of
the
theory
of
[Mzk1]
as
a
“discretization”
of
the
well-known
local
comparison
isomorphisms.
Another
way
that
one
might
20
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
think
of
the
theory
of
[Mzk1]
is
as
a
“Hodge
theory
at
ﬁnite
resolution”
(where
we
use
the
term
“resolution”
as
in
discussions
of
the
number
of
“pixels”
(i.e.,
“picture
elements,
dots”)
of
a
computer
screen).
At
this
point,
the
reader
might
feel
motivated
to
pose
the
following
question:
If
the
Hodge-Arakelov
Comparison
Isomorphism
is
indeed
a
comparison
isomorphism
analogous
to
the
complex
and
p-adic
comparison
isomorphisms,
then
what
sorts
of
“global
periods”
does
it
give
rise
to?
For
instance,
in
the
case
of
the
complex
comparison
isomorphism,
the
most
basic
period
is
the
period
of
the
Tate
motive,
i.e.,
of
H
1
of
Gm
,
namely,
2πi.
In
the
p-adic
case,
the
corresponding
period
is
the
copy
of
Zp
(1)
that
sits
naturally
inside
Bcrys
.
The
analogous
“period”
resulting
from
the
theory
of
Theorem
A,
then,
is
the
following:
Let
U
be
the
standard
multiplicative
coordinate
on
Gm
.
Then
U
−
1
forms
a
section
of
some
ample
line
bundle
on
Gm
,
hence
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“theta
function”
(cf.
especially,
the
Schottky
uniformization
of
an
elliptic
curve,
as
in
[Mumf4],
§5).
Then,
roughly
speaking,
the
“discretized
Hodge
theory”
of
[Mzk1]
amounts
essentially
—
from
the
point
of
view
of
periods
—
to
thinking
of
the
period
“2πi”
as
lim
n
·
(U
−
1)|U
=exp(2πi/n)
n→∞
i.e.,
the
evaluation
of
a
theta
function
at
an
n-torsion
point,
for
some
large
n.
For
the
elliptic
curve
analogue
(at
archimedean
primes)
of
this
representation
of
2πi,
we
refer
especially
to
[Mzk1],
Chapter
VII,
§5,
6.
In
fact,
another
way
to
interpret
the
theory
of
[Mzk1]
is
the
following.
First,
let
us
observe
that
the
classical
complex
comparison
isomorphism
(i.e.,
the
de
Rham
isomorphism)
is
centered
around
“diﬀerentiation”
and
“integration,”
i.e.,
calculus
on
the
elliptic
curve.
Moreover,
in
some
sense,
the
most
fundamental
aspect
of
calculus
as
opposed
to
algebraic
geometry
on
the
elliptic
curve
is
the
use
of
real
analytic
functions
on
the
elliptic
curve.
In
the
present
context,
however,
we
wish
to
keep
everything
“arithmetic”
and
“global”
over
a
number
ﬁeld.
Thus,
instead
of
performing
calculus
on
the
underlying
real
analytic
manifold
of
a
(complex)
elliptic
curve,
we
approximate
this
classical
sort
of
calculus
by
performing
calculus
on
a
ﬁnite
(but
“large”)
set
of
torsion
points
of
the
elliptic
curve.
That
is
to
say:
We
regard
the
set
of
torsion
points
as
an
approximation
of
the
underlying
real
analytic
manifold
of
an
elliptic
curve.
Indeed,
this
notion
of
“discrete
torsion
calculus”
is
one
of
the
key
ideas
of
[Mzk1].
For
instance,
the
universal
extension
of
a
complex
elliptic
curve
has
a
canonical
real
analytic
splitting
(cf.
[Mzk1],
Chapter
III,
Deﬁnition
3.2),
which
is
fundamental
to
the
Hodge
theory
of
the
elliptic
curve
(cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk7],
Introduction,
§0.7,
0.8).
Since
this
splitting
passes
through
the
torsion
points
of
the
universal
SURVEY
OF
HODGE-ARAKELOV
THEORY
21
extension
(and,
in
fact,
is
equal
to
the
closure
of
these
torsion
points
in
the
complex
topology),
it
is
thus
natural
to
regard
the
torsion
points
of
the
universal
extension
as
a
“discrete
torsion
calculus
approximation”
to
the
canonical
real
analytic
splitting
(cf.
Remark
1
following
[Mzk1],
Chapter
III,
Deﬁnition
3.2).
This
“discrete
torsion
calculus”
point
of
view
may
also
be
seen
in
the
use
of
the
operator
“δ”
in
[Mzk1],
Chapter
III,
§6,7
(cf.
also
[Mzk1],
Chapter
V,
§4),
as
well
as
in
the
discussion
of
the
“discrete
Tchebycheﬀ
polynomials”
in
[Mzk1],
Chapter
VII,
§3.
§1.3.5
Relationship
to
Ordinary
Frobenius
Liftings
and
Anabelian
Varieties
Finally,
before
proceeding,
we
present
one
more
approach
to
thinking
about
“absolute
diﬀerentiation
over
F1
.”
Perhaps
the
most
naive
approach
to
deﬁning
the
derivative
of
a
number
n
∈
Z
(cf.
[Ihara])
is
to
ﬁx
a
prime
number
p,
and
then
to
compare
n
with
its
Teichmüller
representative
[n]p
∈
Zp
.
The
idea
here
is
that
Teichmüller
representatives
should
somehow
represent
something
analogous
to
a
“ﬁeld
of
constants”
inside
Zp
.
Thus,
we
obtain
a
correspondence
p→
1
(n
−
[n]p
)
p
Unfortunately,
if
one
starts
from
this
naive
point
of
view,
it
seems
to
be
very
diﬃcult
to
prove
interesting
global
results
concerning
this
correspondence,
much
less
to
apply
it
to
proving
interesting
results
in
diophantine
geometry.
Thus,
it
is
natural
to
attempt
to
recast
this
naive
approach
in
a
form
that
is
more
amenable
to
globalization.
To
do
this,
let
us
ﬁrst
note
that
to
consider
Teichmüller
representatives
is
very
closely
related
to
considering
the
natural
Frobenius
morphism
ΦA
:
A
→
A
def
on
the
ring
of
Witt
vectors
A
=
W
(Fp
).
In
fact,
the
Teichmüller
representatives
in
A
are
precisely
the
elements
which
satisfy
the
equation:
ΦA
(a)
=
ap
Put
another
way,
if
a
is
a
unit,
then
it
may
be
thought
of
as
an
element
∈
Gm
(A).
Moreover,
Gm
is
equipped
with
its
own
natural
Frobenius
action
ΦGm
,
given
by
U
→
U
p
(where
U
is
the
standard
multiplicative
coordinate
on
Gm
).
Thus,
the
Teichmüller
representatives
are
given
by
those
elements
of
a
∈
Gm
(A)
such
that
ΦA
(a)
=
ΦGm
(a)
In
fact,
this
sort
of
situation
where
one
has
a
natural
Frobenius
action
on
a
p-adic
(formal)
scheme,
and
one
considers
natural
p-adic
liftings
of
points
on
this
scheme
22
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
modulo
p
which
are
characterized
by
the
property
that
they
are
taken
to
their
Frobenius
(i.e.,
ΦA
)
conjugates
by
the
given
action
of
Frobenius
occurs
elsewhere
in
arithmetic
geometry.
Perhaps
the
most
well-known
example
of
this
situation
(after
Gm
)
is
the
Serre-Tate
theory
of
liftings
of
ordinary
abelian
varieties
(cf.,
e.g.,
[Katz2],
as
well
as
[Mzk7],
Introduction,
§0).
Recently,
this
theory
has
been
generalized
to
the
case
of
moduli
of
hyperbolic
curves
([Mzk6,7]).
We
refer
to
the
Introductions
of
[Mzk6,7]
for
more
on
this
phenomenon.
In
the
theory
of
[Mzk6,7],
this
sort
of
natural
Frobenius
action
on
a
p-adic
(formal)
scheme
is
referred
to
as
an
ordinary
Frobenius
lifting.
The
theory
of
ordinary
Frobenius
liftings
is
itself
a
special
(and,
in
some
sense,
the
simplest)
case
of
p-adic
Hodge
theory.
Thus,
in
summary,
from
this
point
of
view,
the
naive
approach
discussed
above
(involving
the
correspondence
p
→
1
p
(n
−
[n]p
))
may
be
thought
of
as
the
approach
given
by
“looking
at
the
p-adic
Hodge
theory
of
Gm
at
each
prime
p.”
In
particular,
the
relationship
between
the
approach
of
[Mzk1]
and
the
above
naive
approach
may
be
thought
of
as
the
diﬀerence
between
discretizing
the
various
local
p-adic
Hodge
theories
into
a
global
Arakelov-theoretic
theory
(as
discussed
in
§1.3.1
–
1.3.4
above)
and
looking
at
the
full
completed
p-adic
Hodge
theories
individually.
In
fact,
there
is
another
important
diﬀerence
between
the
approach
of
[Mzk1]
log
and
the
above
naive
approach
—
namely,
the
diﬀerence
between
Gm
and
Mell
(the
log
moduli
stack
of
log
elliptic
curves).
That
is
to
say,
unlike
the
example
discussed
above,
which
is
essentially
concerned
with
rational
points
of
Gm
,
the
log
theory
of
[Mzk1]
concerns
“absolute
diﬀerentiation
for
points
of
Mell
.”
At
the
present
time,
the
author
does
not
know
of
an
analogous
approach
to
“globally
discretizing”
the
local
Hodge
theories
of
Gm
(i.e.,
of
doing
for
Gm
what
is
done
log
for
Mell
in
[Mzk1]).
Also,
it
is
interesting
to
observe
that,
unlike
many
theories
for
elliptic
curves
which
generalize
in
a
fairly
straightforward
manner
to
abelian
varieties
of
higher
dimension,
it
is
not
so
clear
how
to
generalize
the
theory
of
[Mzk1]
to
higher-dimensional
abelian
varieties
(cf.
§1.5.2
below).
Thus,
it
is
tempting
to
log
conjecture
that
perhaps
the
existence
of
the
theory
of
[Mzk1]
in
the
case
of
Mell
log
is
somehow
related
to
the
anabelian
nature
of
Mell
(cf.
[Mzk8],
[IN]).
That
is
to
say,
one
central
feature
of
anabelian
varieties
is
a
certain
“extraordinary
rigidity”
exhibited
by
their
p-adic
Hodge
theory
(cf.
[Groth];
the
Introduction
to
[Mzk8]).
In
particular,
it
is
tempting
to
suspect
that
this
sort
of
rigidity
or
coherence
is
what
allows
one
to
discretize
the
various
local
Hodge
theories
into
a
coherent
global
theory.
Another
interesting
observation
in
this
direction
is
that
the
theta
groups
that
play
an
essential
role
in
[Mzk1]
are
essentially
the
same
as/intimately
related
to
the
quotient
π1
(E
−
pt.)/[π1
(E
−
pt.),
[π1
(E
−
pt.),
π1
(E
−
pt.)]]
of
the
fundamental
group
π1
(E
−
pt.)
of
an
elliptic
curve
with
one
point
removed
(which
is
itself
an
anabelian
variety).
This
sort
of
quotient
of
the
fundamental
group
plays
a
central
role
in
[Mzk8].
SURVEY
OF
HODGE-ARAKELOV
THEORY
23
Finally,
we
remark
that
one
point
of
view
related
to
the
discussion
of
the
preceding
paragraph
is
the
following:
One
fundamental
obstacle
to
“diﬀerentiating
an
integer
n
∈
Z
(or
Q-rational
point
of
Gm
)
over
F1
”
is
that
the
residue
ﬁelds
Fp
at
the
diﬀerent
points
of
Spec(Z)
diﬀer,
thus
making
it
diﬃcult
to
compare
the
value
of
n
at
distinct
points
of
Spec(Z).
On
the
other
hand,
the
theory
of
[Mzk1]
—
which
involves
diﬀerentiating
Z-valued
points
of
the
moduli
stack
of
log
log
elliptic
curves
Mell
—
gets
around
this
problem
eﬀectively
by
taking
the
set
of
dtorsion
points
as
one’s
absolute
constants
that
do
not
vary
even
as
the
residue
ﬁeld
varies.
Note
that
relative
to
the
discussion
of
§1.3.4,
this
set
of
torsion
points
should
be
regarded
as
a
discrete
analogue/approximation
to
the
underlying
real
analytic
manifold
(which,
of
course,
remains
constant)
of
a
family
of
complex
elliptic
curves.

we
observe
that

can

construct
an

of
the

Roughly
speaking,
this

is
a

from
the

of

§1,
where
a
certain
technical
error
made
in
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX,
§3,
is
corrected).
This
construction
will
be
surveyed
in
the
remainder
of
the
present
§.
In
§1.4.2
below,
we
give
a
construction
of
the
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
in
the
complex
case
which
is
entirely
analogous
to
the
construction
given
in
the
arithmetic
case
in
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX,
§3,
but
which
shows
quite
explicitly
how
this
construction
is
related
(in
the
complex
case)
to
the
“classical
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism”
that
appears
in
the
theory
of
moduli
of
algebraic
varieties.
Also,
we
remark
that
a
similar
treatment
of
the
classical
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
may
be
given
in
the
p-adic
context
(cf.
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX,
§2),
but
we
will
not
discuss
this
aspect
of
the
theory
in
the
present
manuscript.
Conceptually
speaking,
the
main
point
in
all
of
these
constructions
consists,
as
depicted
in
the
following
diagram:
24
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism:
motion
in
base-space
→
induced
deformation
of
Hodge
ﬁltration
of
the
idea
that
the
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
is
the
map
which
associates
to
a
“motion”
in
the
base-space
of
a
family
of
elliptic
curves,
the
deformation
in
the
Hodge
ﬁltration
of
the
de
Rham
cohomology
of
the
elliptic
curve
induced
by
the
motion.
More
concretely,
the
main
idea
consists
of
a
certain
“recipe”
for
constructing
“Kodaira-Spencer-type
morphisms”
out
of
“comparison
isomorphisms
between
de
Rham
and
étale/singular
cohomology.”
In
the
present
§,
we
carry
out
this
recipe
in
the
case
when
the
comparison
isomorphism
is
the
the
Hodge-Arakelov
Comparison
Isomorphism
(§1.1,
Theorem
A);
in
§1.4.2
below,
we
discuss
a
certain
approach
to
the
well-known
comparison
isomorphism
for
elliptic
curves
in
the
complex
case,
which,
on
the
one
hand,
makes
the
connection
with
the
classical
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
explicit,
and,
on
the
other
hand,
shows
how
the
Hodge-Arakelov
Comparison
Isomorphism
is
entirely
analogous
to
the
well-known
complex
comparison
isomorphism.
For
simplicity,
in
the
following
discussion,
we
let
S
be
a
Q-scheme
of
ﬁnite
type,
and
E→S
a
family
of
elliptic
curves
over
S.
Also,
we
use
the
notation
ΠS
for
the
étale
local
system
on
S
determined
by
the
association
s
→
π1
(S,
s)
(where
s
is
a
geometric
point
of
S).
Next,
let
us
observe
that
(for
d
≥
1
an
integer)
we
have
a
natural
(OS
-linear)
action
of
ΠS
on
E[d]
→
S
(where
E[d]
⊆
E
is
the
closed
subscheme
of
d-torsion
points
of
E
→
S).
Indeed,
if
s
is
a
geometric
point
of
S,
then
the
restriction
of
this
action
to
the
ﬁbers
at
s
is
simply
the
usual
action
arising
from
the
classical
theory
of
the
algebraic
fundamental
group.
That
is
to
say,
according
to
this
theory,
one
has
a
natural
action
of
ΠS
|s
=
π1
(S,
s)
on
E[d]|s
arising
from
the
fact
that
E[d]|s
is
the
result
of
applying
the
ﬁber
functor
deﬁned
by
s
to
the
ﬁnite
étale
covering
E[d]
→
S.
The
natural
action
of
the
algebraic
fundamental
groupoid
on
E[d]
is
discussed
in
detail
in
[Mzk4],
§1.
Also,
we
remark
that
the
dependence
of
this
natural
action
on
the
SURVEY
OF
HODGE-ARAKELOV
THEORY
25
basepoint
s
is
essential
(a
fact
overlooked
in
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX,
§3),
which
is
why
one
must
use
the
local
system
ΠS
,
as
opposed
to
the
“static”
fundamental
group
for
a
ﬁxed
basepoint.
Remark.
One
interesting
observation
relative
to
the
appearance
of
the
algebraic
fundamental
groupoid
(i.e.,
as
opposed
to
group)
in
the
correct
formulation
of
the
arithmetic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
(cf.
[Mzk4],
Corollary
1.6)
is
the
following.
In
the
analogy
asserted
in
[Mzk1]
between
the
arithmetic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
of
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX,
§3,
and
the
usual
geometric
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism,
the
Galois
group/fundamental
group(oid)
of
the
base
plays
the
role
of
the
tangent
bundle
of
the
base.
On
the
other
hand,
the
tangent
bundle
of
the
base
(typically)
does
not
admit
a
canonical
global
trivialization,
but
instead
varies
from
point
to
point
—
i.e.,
at
a
given
point,
it
consists
of
inﬁnitesimal
motions
originating
from
that
point.
Thus,
it
is
natural
that
the
arithmetic
analogue
of
the
tangent
bundle
should
be
not
the
“static”
fundamental
group,
but
instead
the
fundamental
groupoid,
which
varies
from
point
to
point,
and
indeed,
at
a
given
point,
consists
of
paths
(which
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“motion”)
originating
from
that
point.
Now
suppose
(cf.
§1.1,
Theorem
Asimple
)
that
we
are
also
given
a
torsion
point
η
∈
E(K)
whose
order
does
not
divide
d.
Write
def
L
=
OE
(d
·
[η])
In
the
following
discussion,
we
would
also
like
to
assume
(for
simplicity)
that
d
is
odd.
Then
by
Mumford’s
theory
of
theta
groups,
one
has
a
natural
isomorphism
L|E[d]
∼
=
L|0E
⊗OS
OE[d]
(where
0E
∈
E(S)
is
the
origin
of
E)
—
which
we
shall
refer
to
as
the
“theta
trivialization”
of
L
over
E[d].
In
particular,
since
the
natural
action
of
ΠS
on
E[d]
is
OS
-linear,
one
thus
obtains
(via
this
“theta
trivialization”)
a
natural
action
of
ΠS
on
L|E[d]
.
On
the
other
hand
(cf.
§1.1,
Theorem
Asimple
),
we
have
a
natural
isomorphism
def
∼
HDR
=
f∗
(L|E
†
)<d
→L|E[d]
(where,
by
abuse
of
notation,
all
structure
morphisms
to
S
are
denoted
by
f
).
Thus,
the
action
of
ΠS
on
L|E[d]
gives
rise
to
a
natural
action
of
ΠS
on
HDR
.
Moreover,
since
HDR
is
also
equipped
with
a
Hodge
ﬁltration
F
r
(HDR
)
(given
by
considering
sections
of
L|E
†
of
torsorial
degree
<
r),
one
may
consider
the
extent
to
which
this
Hodge
ﬁltration
is
ﬁxed
by
ΠS
.
If
we
write
Filt(HDR
)
→
S
26
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
for
the
ﬂag
variety
over
S
of
ﬁltrations
of
HDR
of
the
“same
type”
(i.e.,
such
that
the
subobject
of
index
r
has
the
same
rank
as
F
r
(HDR
)),
then
the
correspondence
σ
→
{F
r
(HDR
)}σ
(where
σ
is
an
étale
local
section
of
ΠS
,
and
“{F
r
(HDR
)}σ
”
denotes
the
ﬁltration
of
HDR
obtained
by
acting
on
the
Hodge
ﬁltration
of
HDR
by
σ)
deﬁnes
a
morphism
:
ΠS
→
Filt(HDR
)(S)
κarith
E
—
which
(cf.
the
discussion
in
the
complex
case
in
§1.4.2
below)
we
refer
to
as
the
arithmetic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
of
the
family
of
elliptic
curves
E
→
S.
When
S
is
ﬂat
over
Z
—
i.e.,
for
instance,
when
S
is
the
spectrum
of
a
(Zariski
localization)
of
the
ring
of
integers
OF
of
a
number
ﬁeld
F
—
this
morphism
κarith
E
has
various
strong
integrality
properties
at
both
nonarchimedean
(i.e.,
“p-adic”)
and
archimedean
primes,
inherited
from
the
integrality
properties
of
the
comparison
isomorphism
of
§1.1,
Theorem
A.
These
integrality
properties
are
discussed
in
more
detail
in
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX,
§3.
§1.4.2
Complex
Analogue
In
this
§,
we
review
the
de
Rham
isomorphism
of
a
complex
elliptic
curve,
showing
how
this
isomorphism
may
be
regarded
as
being
analogous
in
a
fairly
precise
sense
to
the
Comparison
Isomorphism
of
§1.1,
Theorem
A.
We
then
discuss
the
theory
of
the
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
of
a
family
of
complex
elliptic
curves
in
the
universal
case,
but
we
formulate
this
theory
in
a
somewhat
novel
fashion,
showing
how
the
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
may
be
derived
directly
from
the
de
Rham
isomorphism
in
a
rather
geometric
way.
This
formulation
will
allow
us
to
make
the
connection
with
the
global
arithmetic
theory
of
§1.4.1;
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX,
§3.
We
begin
our
discussion
by
considering
a
single
elliptic
curve
E
over
C.
Frequently
in
the
following
discussion,
we
shall
also
write
“E”
for
the
complex
manifold
deﬁned
by
the
original
algebraic
curve.
Recall
(cf.
[Mzk1],
Chapter
III,
§3)
that
we
have
a
commutative
diagram
1
(E,
OE
)
=

elt.
Here,
the
horizontal
isomorphisms
are
the
de
Rham
isomorphisms
relating
de
Rham
cohomology
to
singular
cohomology.
Note
that
in
characteristic
zero,
line
bundles
SURVEY

27
with
connection
are
necessarily
of
degree
zero,
so
E

may
be
naturally
identi×
1
(E,
OE
),
the
group
of
line
bundles
equipped
with
a
connection
on
ﬁed
with
HDR
E.
(Similarly,
the
(topological)
universal
cover
E
†
of
E
†
may
be
identiﬁed
with
1
HDR
(E,
OE
).)
The
vertical
maps
are
the
morphisms
induced
on
cohomology
by
the
exponential
map;
S1
⊆
C×
is
the
unit
circle
(equipped
with
its
usual
group
structure).
Finally,
ER
⊆
E
†
is
the
real
analytic
submanifold
(discussed
in
[Mzk1],
Chapter
III,
§3)
which
is
equal
to
the
closure
of
the
torsion
points
of
E
†
and
maps
bijectively
onto
E
via
the
natural
projection
E
†
→
E.
Here,
we
would
like
to
consider
the
issue
of
precisely
how
the
de
Rham
isomorphisms
of
the
above
diagram
are
deﬁned.
Of
course,
there
are
many
possible
deﬁnitions
for
these
isomorphisms,
but
the
point
that
we
would
like
to
make
here
is
the
following:
def
1
If
one
thinks
of
Hsing
(E,
S1
)
=
ER
(respectively,
Tv
(E)
=
1
(E,
2πi
·
R))
as
the
“v-divisible
group
of
torsion
points
of
Hsing
E”
(respectively,
the
“v-adic
Tate
module”)
—
where
v
=
∞
is
the
archimedean
prime
of
Q
—
then,
roughly
speaking,
one
may
think
of
the
de
Rham
isomorphisms
as
being
given
by
the
diagram
1
Hol.

on
HDR
(E,
OE
)
=
E
†
“∼

1
Real
an.

on

on
HDR
“∼

1
Real
an.
fns.
on
Hsing
(E,
S1
)
=
ER
where
the
horizontal
isomorphisms
“∼

are
given
by
restricting
†
†
holomorphic
functions
on
E
,
E
to
real
analytic
functions
on
the
def
1
(E,
2πi·
“∞-adic
torsion
points/Tate
module”
ER
,
T∞
(E)
=
Hsing
R).
Here,
we
say
“roughly
speaking”
(and
write
“∼
=”)
for
the
following
reason:
Although
this
restriction
morphism
is
injective,
the
correspondence
between
holomorphic
functions
on
the
de
Rham
objects
E
†
,
E
†
and
real
analytic
functions
on
the
v-adic
torsion
point
objects
ER
,
T∞
(E)
is,
strictly
speaking,
only
true
on
an
“inﬁnitesimal
neighborhood”
of
ER
⊆
E
†
,
T∞
(E)
⊆
E
†
.
(That
is
to
say,
although
a
real
analytic
function
on
ER
always
corresponds
to
a
holomorphic
function
on
some
open
neighborhood
of
ER
in
E
†
,
whether
or
not
this
holomorphic
function
extends
to
a
holomorphic
function
deﬁned
over
all
of
E
†
involves
subtle
convergence
issues
and,
in
fact,
is
not
always
the
case.)
Thus,
here,
in
order
to
get
a
precise
statement,
we
shall
work
with
polynomial
functions
on
E
†
and
T∞
(E).
Then
one
sees
immediately
that
the
de
Rham
isomorphism
of
the
ﬁrst
commutative
diagram
of
this
§
may
be
formulated
as
the
isomorphism
HolomPoly
(E
†
)
∼
=
Real
AnPoly
(T∞
(E))
28
SHINICHI

given
by
restricting
holomorphic
polynomials
on
E
†
to
the
∞-adic
torsion
points
so
as
to
obtain
real
analytic
polynomials
on
T∞
(E).
When
formulated
from
this
point
of
view,
one
sees
that
the
Comparison
Isomorphism
of
§1.1,
Theorem
A,
is
analogous
in
a
very
direct
sense
to
the
classical
de
Rham
isomorphism
in
the
complex
case,
i.e.:
Both
may
be
thought
of
as
being
bijections
between
algebraic/holomorphic
functions
on
de
Rham-type
objects
and
arbitrary/real
analytic
functions
on
torsion
points
–
bijections
given
by
restricting
algebraic/holomorphic
functions
on
de
Rham-type
objects
to
the
torsion
points
lying
inside
those
de
Rham-type
objects.
This
observation
may
be
thought
of
as
the
philosophical
starting
point
of
the
theory
of
[Mzk1].
1
Remark.
Note
that
the
collection
of
“holomorphic
functions
on
HDR
(E,
OE
)”
includes,
in
particular,
the
theta
functions
(cf.,
e.g.,
[Mumf4],
§3)
associated
to
the
elliptic
curve
E.
Moreover,
these
functions
are
“fairly
representative
of”
(roughly
1
(E,
OE
)
that
arise
speaking,
“generate”)
the
set
of
all
holomorphic
functions
on
HDR
1
1
by
pull-back
via
the
projection
HDR
(E,
OE
)
→
H
(E,
OE
)
(deﬁned
by
the
Hodge
ﬁltration)
from
holomorphic
functions
on
H
1
(E,
OE
).
This
observation
played
a
fundamental
motivating
role
in
the
development
of
the
theory
of
[Mzk1].
Next,
we
shift
gears
and
discuss
various
versions
of
the
Kodaira-Spencer
mordef
phism
for
the
universal
family
of
complex
elliptic
curves.
First,
let
us
write
H
=
{z
∈
C
|
Im(z)
>
0}
for
the
upper
half-plane,
and
EH
→
H
for
the
universal
family
of
complex
elliptic
curves
over
H.
That
is
to
say,
over
a
point
z
∈
H,
the
ﬁber
Ez
of
this
family
is
given
by
Ez
=
C/
<
1,
z
>
(where
<
1,
z
>
denotes
the
Z-submodule
generated
by
1,
z).
Let
us
ﬁx
a
“base-point”
z0
∈
H.
Write
def
1
1
(Ez0
)
=
HDR
(Ez0
,
OEz0
)
HDR
1
(Ez0
)
is
a
two-dimensional
complex
vector
space.
Recall
that,
in
fact,
Thus,
HDR

the
correspondence

deﬁnes
a
rank
two
vector
bundle
E
on
H
equipped
with
a
natural
(integrable)
connection
(the
“Gauss-Manin
connection”).
Since
the
underlying
topological
space
of
H
is
contractible,
parallel
transport
via
this
connection
thus
gives
rise
to
a
natural
trivialization
of
this
rank
two
vector
bundle
E,
i.e.,
a
natural
isomorphism

Recall
that
the
Hodge
ﬁltration
of
de

cohomology
deﬁnes
a
subbundle
F
1
(E)
⊆
E
of
rank
one.
This
subbundle
induces
a

that
maps

F

at

Now
let
us
recall
that
we
have
a
natural

of

on

given
by
linear
fractional
transformations.
This
action
allows
us
to
deﬁne
a
morphism
κSL2
:
SL2
(R)
→
P
def
by
letting
κSL2
(γ)
=
κH
(γ
·
z0
)
(for
γ
∈
SL2
(R)).
If
we
then
diﬀerentiate
κSL2
at
z0
,
we
obtain
a
morphism
on
tangent
spaces
that
ﬁts
into
a
commutative
diagram:

⏐
⏐
sl2
(R)/so2
κsl
2
−→
∼
=
τP,p0
⏐κ
⏐
τ
τH,z0
Here,
the
vertical
morphism
on
top
is
the
derivative
of
κSL2
at
the
origin
of
SL2
(R);
def
τP,p0
(respectively,
τH,z0
)
is
the
tangent
space
to
P
(respectively,
H)
at
p0
=
κH
(z0
)
(respectively,
z0
).
This
vertical
morphism
clearly
factors
through
the
quotient
sl2
(R)
→
sl2
(R)/so2
,
where
sl2
(R)
(respectively,
so2
)
is
the
Lie
algebra
associated
to
SL2
(R)
(respectively,
the
subgroup
of
SL2
(R)
that
ﬁxes
z0
).
Moreover,
all
tangent
vectors
to
z0
∈
H
are
obtained
by
acting
by
various
elements
of
sl2
(R)
on
H
at
z0
;
thus,
one
may
identify
sl2
(R)/so2
with
τH,z0
(the
vertical
isomorphism
on
the
bottom).
Deﬁnition.
We
shall
refer
to
κSL2
(respectively,
κsl2
;
κτ
)
as
the
group-theoretic
(respectively,
Lie-theoretic;
classical)
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
(of
the
family
EH
→
H
at
z0
).
Thus,
the
“classical
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism”
κτ
is
obtained
(cf.
the
above
commutative
diagram)
simply
by
using
the
fact
that
κsl2
factors
through
the
quotient
sl2
(R)
→
sl2
(R)/so2
.
One
checks
easily
that
this
morphism
is
indeed
the
usual
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
associated
to
the
family
EH
→
H.
In
particular,
κτ
is
an
isomorphism.
The
reason
that
we
feel
that
it
is
natural
also
to
regard
κSL2
and
κsl2
as
“Kodaira-Spencer
morphisms”
is
the
following:
The
essence
of
the
notion
of
a
“Kodaira-Spencer
morphism”
is
that
of
a
correspondence
that
associates
to
a
motion
in
the
base-space
the
induced
deformation
of
the
Hodge
ﬁltration
of
the
de
Rham
cohomology,
i.e.,
symbolically,

In
the
case
of
the
“group-theoretic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism”
(respectively,
“Lietheoretic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism”;
“classical
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism”),
this
motion
is
a
motion
given
by
the
“Lie
group
SL2
(R)
of
motions
of
H”
(respectively,
the
Lie
algebra
associated
to
this
Lie
group
of
motions;
a
tangent
vector
in
H).
That
is
to
say,
all
three
types
of
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
discussed
here
ﬁt
into
the
general
pattern
just
described.
It
turns
out
that
the
group-theoretic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
is
the
version
which
is
most
suited
to
generalization
to
the
arithmetic
case
(cf.
the
discussions
of
§2,3
below).
Finally,
we
make
the
connection
between
the
theory
of
the
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
just
discussed
and
the
function-theoretic
approach
to
the
de
Rham
isomorphism
discussed
at
the
beginning
of
this
§.
First
of
all,
let
us
observe
that
the
action
of
SL2
(R)
on
H
lifts
naturally
to
an
action
on
E.
Moreover,
if
one
thinks
of
SL2
(R)
as
the
group
of
unimodular
(i.e.,
with
determinant
=
1)
R-linear
automorphisms
of
the
two-dimensional
R-vector
space
T∞
(Ez0
),
that
is,
if
one
makes
the
identiﬁcation
SL2
(R)
=
SL(T∞
(Ez0
))
1
(Ez0
)
corresponds
to
the
natural
action
then
the
action
of
SL2
(R)
on
E
∼
=
H
×
HDR
1
of
SL(T∞
(Ez0
))
on
HDR
(Ez0
)
∼
=
T∞
(Ez0
)
⊗R
C
(where
the
isomorphism
here
is
the
de
Rham
isomorphism).
It
thus
follows
that
the
group-theoretic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
κSL2
may
also
be
deﬁned
as
the
morphism
1
SL2
(R)
=
SL(T∞
(Ez0
))
→
P
=
P(HDR
(Ez0
))
given
by
γ
→
γ
·
p0
,
where
the
expression
“γ
·
p0
”
is
relative
to
the
natural
action
of
1
SL(T∞
(Ez0
))
on
P
=
P(HDR
(Ez0
))
∼
=
P(T∞
(Ez0
)
⊗R
C)
(where
the
isomorphism
here
is
that
derived
from
the
de
Rham
isomorphism).
This
approach
to
deﬁning
κSL2
shows
that:
The
group-theoretic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
κSL2
may
essentially
be
deﬁned
directly
from
the
de
Rham
isomorphism.
This
observation
brings
us
one
step
closer
to
the
discussion
of
the
arithmetic
case
in
§3.
In
particular,
in
light
of
the
above
“function-theoretic
approach
to
the
de
Rham
isomorphism,”
it
motivates
the
following
point
of
view:
Note
that
(in
the
notation
of
the
discussion
at
the
beginning
of
this
§)
the
space
HolomPoly
(E

of
holomorphic

denote
the
subspace
of
polynomials
whose
“torsorial
degree”
(cf.
[Mzk1],
Chapter
III,
Deﬁnition
2.2),
i.e.,
degree
as
a
polynomial
in
the
relative
variable
of
the
torsor
E

→
E
(where
E
is
the
universal
covering
space
of
E),
is
<
d.
Note
that
relative
to
the
“function-theoretic
de

isomorphism”
HolomPoly
(E

)
∼
=
Real
AnPoly
(T∞
(E)),
F
d
(HolomPoly
(E

))
d
corresponds
to
the
subspace
of
Real
AnPoly
(T∞
(E))
annihilated
by
D
.
(Here,
D
is
the
usual
“del-bar”
operator
of
complex
analysis
on
T∞
(E)
=
ER
,
relative
to
the
complex
structure
on
ER
deﬁned
by
E.)
Let
us
write
Filt(HolomPoly
(E

))
for
the
(inﬁnite-dimensional)
ﬂag-manifold
of
C-linear
ﬁltrations
{F
d
}d∈Z≥0
of
HolomPoly
(E
†
)
such
that
F
0
=
0.
Then
the
“Hodge
ﬁltration”
just
deﬁned
determines
a
point
pfunc
∈
Filt(HolomPoly
(E

))
E
Similarly,
any
one-dimensional
complex
quotient
E
†
→
Q
deﬁnes
a
ﬁltration
of
HolomPoly
(E

)
(given
by
looking
at
the
degree
with
respect
to
the
variable
corresponding
to
the
kernel
of
E
†
→
Q).
In
particular,
we
get
an
immersion
P(E

)
→
Filt(HolomPoly
(E

))
Thus,
returning
to
the
discussion
of
the
group-theoretic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism,
we
see
that
we
may
think
of
the
composite
Poly

SL2
:
SL2
(R)
=
SL(T∞

as
being
deﬁned
as
follows:
The

on

induces,

Real

∼

an

It
is
this
point
of
view
that
forms
the
basis
of
our
approach
to
the
arithmetic
case,
as
surveyed
in
§1.4.1.
Remark.
The
theory
discussed
above
(cf.
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX,
§1,2)
generalizes
immediately
to
the
case
of
higher-dimensional
abelian
varieties.
Since,
however,
the
Hodge-Arakelov
Comparison
Theorem
(§1.1,
Theorem
A)
is
only
available
(at
the
time
of
writing)
for
elliptic
curves,
we
restricted
ourselves
in
the
above
discussion
to
the
case
of
elliptic
curves.
§1.5.
Future
Directions
§1.5.1
Gaussian
Poles
and
Diophantine
Applications
In
some
sense,
the
most
fundamental
outstanding
problem
left
unsolved
in
[Mzk1]
is
the
following:
How
can
one
get
rid
of
the
Gaussian
poles
(cf.
§1)?
For
instance,
if
one
could
get
rid
of
the
Gaussian
poles
in
Theorem
A,
there
would
be
substantial
hope
of
applying
Theorem
A
to
the
ABC
(or,
equivalently,
Szpiro’s)
Conjecture.
The
main
idea
here
is
the
following:
Assume
that
we
are
given
an
elliptic
curve
EK
over
a
number
ﬁeld
K,
with
everywhere
semi-stable
reduction.
Also,
let
us
assume
that
all
of
the
d-torsion
points
of
EK
are
deﬁned
over
K.
The
arithmetic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
(cf.
§1.4)
essentially
consists
of
applying
some
sort
of
Galois
action
to
an
Arakelov-theoretic
vector
bundle
HDR
on
Spec(OK
)
and
seeing
what
eﬀect
this
Galois
action
has
on
the
natural
Hodge
ﬁltration
F
r
(HDR
)
on
HDR
.
If
one
ignores
the
Gaussian
poles,
the
subquotients
(F
r+1
/F
r
)(HDR
)
of
this
Hodge
ﬁltration
essentially
(“as
a
function
of
r”)
look
like
τE⊗r
(tensored
with
some
object
which
is
essentially
irrelevant
since
it
is
independent
of
r).
Thus,
as
long
as
the
“arithmetic
Kodaira-Spencer
is
nontrivial”
(which
it
most
surely
is!),
the
Galois
action
on
HDR
would
give
rise
to
nontrivial
globally
integral
(in
the
sense
of
Arakelov
theory)
morphisms
SURVEY
OF
HODGE-ARAKELOV

33
OK
=
τE⊗0
≈
F
1
(HDR
)
→
(F
r+1
/F
r
)(HDR
)
≈
τE⊗r
for
some
r
>
1.
That
is
to
say,
we
would
get
a
global
integral
section
of
some
∨
,
which
would
imply
a
bound
on
the
Arakelov-theoretic
positive
power
of
τE
=
ωE
degree
of
ωE
,
i.e.,
a
bound
on
the
height
ht(EK
)
of
the
elliptic
curve
EK
(since
the
height
ht(EK
)
is
equal
to
twice
the
degree
of
ωE
).
Of
course,
one
should
not
expect
to
be
able
to
get
rid
of
the
Gaussian
poles
without
paying
some
sort
of
“tax.”
If,
r
for
instance,
this
tax
is
of
the
order
of
denominators
of
size
≈
D
2
on
(F
r+1
/F
r
)
(where
D
>
0
is
some
real
number
independent
of
r),
then
we
would
obtain
an
inequality
ht(EK
)
≤
log(D)
Thus,
if
D
≈
log(discK/Q
)
(the
log
of
the
discriminant
of
K
over
Q),
then
we
would
obtain
precisely
the
inequality
asserted
in
the
ABC
(or
Szpiro’s)
Conjecture.
(Here,
we
note
that
since
the
d-torsion
points
are
assumed
to
be
rational
over
K,
and
we
typically
expect
that
we
will
want
to
take
d
of
the
order
of
ht(EK
)
(cf.
[Mzk1],
Chapter
II),
typically
log(discK/Q
)
will
be
approximately
equal
to
the
log
discriminant
of
the
minimal
ﬁeld
of
deﬁnition
of
EK
plus
the
logarithm
of
the
primes
of
bad
reduction
of
EK
.
This
is
the
form
in
which
the
ABC
(or
Szpiro’s)
Conjecture
is
usually
stated
(cf.
[Lang],
[Vojta]).)
The
above
sketch
of
an
argument
(i.e.,
that
one
might
be
able
to
apply
Theorem
A
to
the
ABC
Conjecture
if
only
one
could
get
rid
of
the
Gaussian
poles)
provides,
in
the
opinion
of
the
author,
strong
motivation
for
investigating
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
one
can
somehow
eliminate
the
Gaussian
poles
from
Theorem
A.
One
approach
to
eliminating
the
Gaussian
poles
is
the
following:
As
discussed
in
§1.2,
in
some
sense,
one
may
regard
the
theory
of
[Mzk1]
as
the
theory
of
the
Gaussian
and
its
derivatives.
The
classical
example
of
the
theory
of
the
Gaussian
and
its
derivatives
is
the
theory
of
Hermite
functions.
The
Hermite
functions,
which
are
various
derivatives
of
the
Gaussian,
are
not
themselves
polynomials,
but
rather
of
the
form:
(polynomial)
·
(Gaussian)
Thus,
it
is
natural
to
divide
the
Hermite
functions
by
the
Gaussian,
which
then
gives
us
polynomials
which
are
called
the
Hermite
polynomials.
In
the
theory
of
[Mzk1],
the
original
Gaussian
corresponds
(relative
to
taking
the
Fourier
expansion)
to
the
algebraic
theta
functions
of
Mumford
(i.e.,
before
we
consider
derivatives);
the
“unwanted”
Gaussian
that
remains
in
the
Hermite
functions
corresponds
to
34
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
the
Gaussian
poles.
Moreover,
since
multiplication
and
division
correspond
(after
taking
the
Fourier
expansion)
to
convolution,
it
is
natural
to
imagine
that
the
image
of
the
“domain
without
Gaussian
poles”
of
the
Comparison
Isomorphism
(of
Theorem
A)
should
correspond
to
those
functions
on
the
torsion
points
that
are
in
the
image
of
(the
morphism
given
by)
convolution
with
the
(original)
theta
function
—
which
we
refer
to
as
the
“theta
convolution”
for
short.
Thus,
it
is
natural
to
conjecture
that:
By
studying
the
theta
convolution,
one
might
be
able
to
construct
a
Galois
action
like
the
one
needed
in
the
argument
above,
i.e.,
a
“Galois
action
without
Gaussian
poles.”
In
[Mzk2],
we
study
this
theta
convolution,
and
obtain,
in
particular,
a
thetaconvoluted
comparison
isomorphism,
which
has
the
property
that,
in
a
neighborhood
of
the
divisor
at
inﬁnity,
when
one
works
with
an
étale
(i.e.,
isomorphic
to
Z/dZ)
Lagrangian
subgroup,
and
a
multiplicative
(i.e.,
isomorphic
to
μd
)
restriction
subgroup,
then
the
Gaussian
poles
vanish,
as
desired
(cf.
[Mzk2],
especially
Remark
1
following
Theorem
10.1,
for
more
details).
Even
in
the
case
of
the
thetaconvoluted
comparison
isomorphism,
however,
the
Gaussian
poles
fail
to
vanish
(in
a
neighborhood
of
the
divisor
at
inﬁnity)
if
either
the
restriction
subgroup
fails
to
be
multiplicative
or
the
Lagrangian
subgroup
fails
to
be
étale.
At
the
time
of
writing,
however,
the
author
no
longer
believes
the
theory
of
[Mzk2]
to
be
a
strong
candidate
for
eliminating
the
Gaussian
poles
in
the
case
of
elliptic
curves
over
a
number
ﬁeld.
Instead,
it
is
the
sense
of
the
author
that
the
approach
of
[Mzk4]
provides
the
most
promising
candidate
for
achieving
this
goal.
Nevertheless,
the
theory
of
[Mzk2]
is
of
interest
in
its
own
right,
and
will
be
surveyed
in
§2
of
the
present
paper.
§1.5.2
Higher
Dimensional
Abelian
Varieties
and
Hyperbolic
Curves
Once
results
such
as
Theorem
A
(of
§1.1)
have
been
established
for
elliptic
curves,
it
is
natural
to
attempt
to
generalize
such
results
to
higher
dimensional
abelian
varieties
and
hyperbolic
curves.
Unfortunately,
however,
even
in
the
case
of
abelian
varieties,
where
one
expects
the
generalization
to
be
relatively
straightforward,
one
immediately
runs
into
a
number
of
problems.
For
instance,
if
one
considers
sections
of
an
ample
line
bundle
L
over
the
universal
extension
of
an
abelian
variety
of
dimension
g,
the
dimension
over
the
base
ﬁeld
of
the
space
of
global
sections
of
torsorial
degree
<
d
is:


d−1+g
·
dg
<
d2g
g
(where
we
assume
that
the
dimension
of
the
space
of
global
sections
of
L
over
the
abelian
variety
itself
is
equal
to
dg
)
if
g
>
1.
Thus,
the
naive
generalization
of
Theorem
Asimple
cannot
possibly
hold
(i.e.,
since
the
two
spaces
between
which
one
SURVEY

must
construct
an
isomorphism
have
diﬀerent
dimensions).
Nevertheless,
it
would
be
interesting
if
someday
this
sort
of
technical
problem
could
be
overcome,
and
the
theory
of
[Mzk1]
could
be
generalized
to
arbitrary
abelian
varieties.
If
such
a
generalization
could
be
realized,
it
would
be
interesting
if,
for
instance,
just
as
the
various
models
(Hermite,
Legendre,
Binomial)
that
occur
in
the
archimedean
theory
of
the
present
paper
correspond
naturally
to
the
possible
slopes
of
the
action
of
Frobenius
(on
the
ﬁrst
crystalline
cohomology
module
of
an
elliptic
curve)
at
ﬁnite
primes
(cf.
the
discussion
of
this
phenomenon
in
§1),
it
were
the
case
that
the
corresponding
models
in
the
archimedean
theory
for
arbitrary
abelian
varieties
correspond
to
the
possible
Newton
polygons
of
the
action
of
Frobenius
(on
the
ﬁrst
crystalline
cohomology
module
of
an
abelian
variety
of
the
dimension
under
consideration)
at
ﬁnite
primes.
Another
natural
direction
in
which
to
attempt
to
generalize
the
theory
of
this
paper
would
be
to
extend
it
to
a
global/Arakelov-theoretic
Hodge
theory
of
hyperbolic
curves.
Indeed,
the
“complex
Hodge
theory
of
hyperbolic
curves,”
which
revolves
around
the
Köbe
uniformization
of
(the
Riemann
surfaces
corresponding
to)
such
curves
by
the
upper
half-plane,
has
already
been
extended
to
the
p-adic
case
([Mzk6,7]).
Moreover,
the
theory
of
[Mzk6,7]
may
also
be
regarded
as
the
“hyperbolic
curve
analogue”
of
Serre-Tate
theory.
Thus,
it
is
natural
to
attempt
to
construct
a
“global
Arakelov
version”
of
[Mzk6,7],
just
as
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
in
some
sense
constitutes
a
globalization
of
the
Serre-Tate
theory/p-adic
Hodge
theory
of
elliptic
curves
(cf.
Chapter
IX,
§2).
Section

The
Theta
Convolution
§2.1.
Background
In
[Mzk2],
we
continue
our
development
of
the
theory
of
the
Hodge-Arakelov
Comparison
Isomorphism
of
[Mzk1].
Our
main
result
concerns
the
invertibility
of
the
coeﬃcients
of
the
Fourier
transform
of
an
algebraic
theta
function.
Using
this
result,
we
obtain
a
modiﬁed
version
of
the
Hodge-Arakelov
Comparison
Isomorphism
of
[Mzk1],
which
we
refer
to
as
the
Theta-Convoluted
Comparison
Isomorphism.
The
signiﬁcance
of
this
modiﬁed
version
is
that
the
principle
obstruction
to
the
application
of
the
theory
of
[Mzk1]
to
diophantine
geometry
—
namely,
the
Gaussian
poles
—
partially
vanishes
in
the
theta-convoluted
context.
Perhaps
the
simplest
way
to
explain
the
main
idea
of
[Mzk2]
is
the
following:
The
theory
of
[Mzk1]
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
discrete,
scheme-theoretic
2
version
of
the
theory
of
the
classical
Gaussian
e−x
(on
the
real
line)
and
its
derivatives
(cf.
[Mzk1],
Introduction,
§2).
More
concretely,
the
theory
of
[Mzk1]
may,
in
essence,
be
thought
of
as
the
theory
of
the
theta
function
def
Θ
=

n∈Z
2
qn
·
U
n
36
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
(where
q
is
the
q-parameter,
and
U
is
the
standard
multiplicative
coordinate
on
Gm
)
and
its
derivatives
—
i.e.,
functions
of
the
form

2
q
n
·
P
(n)
·
U
n
n∈Z
for
some
polynomial
P
(−)
with
constant
coeﬃcients.
From
this
point
of
view,
the
“Gaussian
poles”
—
which,
as
remarked
above,
constitute
the
principle
obstruction
to
the
application
of
the
theory
of
[Mzk1]
to
diophantine
geometry
—
arise
from
the
factors
of
2
qn
appearing
in
the
above
series.
Thus,
if
one
could
somehow
“magically
replace”
the
above
series
by
series
of
the
form

P
(n)
·
U
n
n∈Z
then
there
would
be
some
hope
of
obtaining
a
theory
without
Gaussian
poles.
Put
another
way,
One
would
like
to
divide
the
coeﬃcient
of
U
n
in
the
usual
series
2
for
Θ
and
its
derivatives
by
the
factor
q
n
.
If
we
think
of
these
series
as
Fourier
series
(on
the
group
Gm
),
then
the
“magical
replacement”
referred
to
above
may
be
expressed
as
convolution
of
the
given
series

2
q
n
·
P
(n)
·
U
n
n∈Z
with
the
series

2
q
−n
·
U
n
n∈Z
—
where
we
recall
that,
at
the
level
of
Fourier
series,
convolution
of
functions
corresponds
to
multiplication
of
Fourier
coeﬃcients.
Thus,
in
summary,
if
we
refer
to
the
map
of
functions
φ→φ∗Θ
(where
“∗”
denotes
convolution)
given
by
convolution
with
Θ
as
the
theta
convolution,
we
see
that
what
we
would
really
like
to
do
is
to
apply
to
a
given
series

the
inverse
of
the
theta
convolution.
In
order
to
do
this,
one
must
ﬁrst
resolve
a
number
of
technical
obstacles:
(1)
First
of
all,
in
order
to
consider
the
inverse
of
the
theta
convolution,
one
must
ﬁrst
show
that
the
theta
convolution
is
invertible.
The
above
formal
discussion
shows
that
the
theta
convolution
is
invertible
in
a
“formal
neighborhood
of
inﬁnity”
(of
the
moduli
stack
of
elliptic
curves).
In
fact,
however,
in
the
context
of
[Mzk1],
one
needs
to
know
invertibility
over
the
entire
moduli
stack
of
elliptic
curves
(not
just
near
inﬁnity).
(2)
In
the
context
of
[Mzk1],
instead
of
working
with
the
group
Gm
,
one
is
eﬀectively
working
with
the
torsion
subgroup
μd
⊆
Gm
(of
d-torsion
points).
Thus,
one
must
prove
that
the
rather
transparent
argument
given
above
in
the
case
of
Gm
may
also
be
carried
out
for
the
torsion
subgroup
μd
—
i.e.,
instead
of
dealing
with
the
“classical
theta
function
Θ,”
we
must
deal
with
Mumford’s
algebraic
theta
functions,
in
which
case
the
coeﬃcients
contain
(in
addition
to
the
easy
to
understand
terms
discussed
above)
other
less
transparent
terms
arising
from
the
discrepancy
between
μd
and
Gm
.
These
technical
obstances
are
resolved
in
the
main
theorem
([Mzk2],
Theorem
9.1)
of
[Mzk2]
on
the
invertibility
of
the
Fourier
coeﬃcients
of
Mumford’s
algebraic
theta
functions.
This
theorem
will
be
discussed
in
more
detail
in
§2.2
below.
Before
proceeding,
we
would
like
to
explain
several
ways
to
think
about
the
contents
of
[Mzk2].
First
of
all,
the
fact
that
the
Fourier
coeﬃcients
of
Mumford’s
algebraic
theta
functions
are
invertible
away
from
the
divisor
at
inﬁnity
appears
(to
the
knowledge
of
the
author)
to
be
new
(i.e.,
it
does
not
seem
to
appear
in
the
classical
theory
of
theta
functions).
Thus,
one
way
to
interpret
[Mzk2],
Theorem
9.1,
is
as
a
result
which
implies
the
existence
of
certain
interesting,
new
modular
units.
It
would
be
interesting
to
see
if
this
point
of
view
can
be
pursued
further
(cf.
[Mzk2],
the
Remark
following
Theorem
9.1).
For
instance,
it
would
be
interesting
to
try
to
compute
these
new
modular
units
as
(multiplicative)
linear
combinations
of
well-known
modular
units,
such
as
Siegel
modular
units.
Another
way
to
think
about
the
contents
of
[Mzk2]
is
the
following.
The
classical
Fourier
expansion
of
Θ
discussed
above
arises
from
the
Fourier
expansion
of
the
restriction
of
the
theta
function
to
a
certain
particular
cycle
(or
copy
of
the
circle
S1
)
on
the
elliptic
curve
E
in
question.
More
explicitly,
if
one
thinks
of
this
elliptic
curve
E
as
being
E
=
C×
/q
Z
38
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
then
this
special
cycle
is
the
image
of
the
natural
copy
of
S1
⊆
C×
.
In
the
present
context,
we
are
considering
discrete
analogues
of
this
classical
complex
theory,
so
instead
of
working
with
this
S1
,
we
work
with
its
d-torsion
points
(for
some
ﬁxed
positive
integer
d),
i.e.,
μd
⊆
S1
⊆
C×
.
On
the
other
hand,
in
order
to
obtain
a
theory
valid
over
the
entire
moduli
stack
of
elliptic
curves,
we
must
consider
Fourier
expansions
of
theta
functions
restricted
not
just
to
this
special
cyclic
subgroup
of
order
d,
i.e.,
μd
⊆
E,
(with
respect
to
which
the
Fourier
expansion
is
particularly
simply
and
easy
to
understand),
but
rather
with
respect
to
an
arbitrary
cyclic
subgroup
of
order
d.
Viewed
from
the
classical
complex
theory,
considering
Fourier
expansions
arising
from
more
general
restriction
subgroups
amounts
to
considering
the
functional
equation
of
the
theta
function.
In
the
classical
complex
theory,
Gauss
sums
arise
naturally
in
the
functional
equation
of
the
theta
function.
Thus,
it
is
not
surprising
that
Gauss
sums
(and,
in
particular,
their
invertibility)
also
play
an
important
role
in
the
theory
of
[Mzk2].
In
fact,
returning
to
the
theory
of
the
Gaussian
on
the
real
line,
one
may
recall
that
one
“important
number”
that
arises
in
this
theory
is
the
√
integral
of
the
Gaussian
(over
the
real
line).
This
integral
is
(roughly
speaking)
π.
On
the
other
hand,
in
the
theory
of
[Mzk2],
Gaussians
correspond
to
“discrete
Gaussians”
(cf.
[Mzk2],
§2),
so
integrals
of
Gaussians
correspond
to
“Gauss
sums.”√That
is
to
say,
Gauss
sums
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
discrete
analogue
of
π.
Thus,
the
appearance
of
Gauss
sums
in
the
theory
of
[Mzk2]
is
also
natural
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
analogy
of
the
theory
of
[Mzk1]
with
the
classical
theory
of
Gaussians
and
their
derivatives
(cf.
§1.2).
√
Indeed,
this
discussion
of
discrete
analogues
of
Gaussians
and
π
leads
one
to
suspect
that
there
is
also
a
natural
p-adic
analogue
of
the
theory
of
[Mzk2]
involving
the
p-adic
ring
of
periods
Bcrys
.
Since
this
ring
of
periods
contains
a
certain
copy
of
Zp
(1)
which
may
be
thought
of
as
a
“p-adic
analogue
of
π,”
it
is
thus
natural
to
suspect
that
in
a
p-adic
analogue
of
the
theory
of
[Mzk2],
some
“square
root
of
this
copy
of
Zp
(1)”
—
and,
in
particular,
its
invertibility
—
should
play
an
analogously
important
role
to
the
role
played
by
the
invertibility
of
Gauss
sums
in
[Mzk2].
§2.2.
Statement
of
the
Main
Theorem
Let
E/K,
d,
η,
and
L
be
as
in
Theorem
Asimple
.
Also,
for
simplicity,
we
assume
in
the
present
discussion
that
d
is
odd,
and
that
we
are
given
two
subgroup
schemes
G,
H
⊆
E[d]
which
are
étale
locally
isomorphic
to
Z/dZ
and
which
satisfy
the
condition
G
×
H
=
E[d]
Since
d
is
odd,
it
follows
from
Mumford’s
theory
of
algebraic
theta
functions
(cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IV,
§1)
that
we
obtain
natural
actions
of
G,
H
on
the
pair
(E,
L).
SURVEY
OF
HODGE-ARAKELOV
THEORY
39
In
the
context
of
[Mzk2],
we
refer
to
G
(respectively,
H)
as
the
restriction
subgroup
(respectively,
Lagrangian
subgroup)
since
we
use
it
as
the
subgroup
to
which
we
restrict
sections
of
L
(respectively,
via
which
we
descend
sections
of
L
to
E/H
—
cf.
the
theory
of
theta
groups).
Note,
in
particular,
that
since
G
acts
on
the
pair
(E,
L),
we
obtain
a
theta
trivialization
L|G
∼
=
L|0E
⊗K
OG
We
are
now
ready
to
state
the
main
result
of
[Mzk2]:
Theorem
B.
(Invertibility
of
the
Fourier
Coeﬃcients
of
an
Algebraic
Theta
Function)
Let
E/K,
d,
η,
L,
G,
and
H
be
as
above.
In
particular,
we
assume
here
(for
simplicity)
that
d
is
odd.
Let
s
∈
Γ(E,
L)H
be
a
generator
of
the
one-dimensional
K-vector
space
of
H-invariant
sections
of
L
over
E.
By
Mumford’s
theory
of
algebraic
theta
functions,
restricting
s
to
G
⊆
E
and
applying
the
theta
trivialization
(reviewed
above)
gives
rise
to
an
algebraic
theta
function
Θs
∈
L|G
∼
=
L|0E
⊗K
OG
i.e.,
a
function
on
the
ﬁnite
group
scheme
G.
With
this
notation,
the
Fourier
coeﬃcients
of
the
function
Θs
on
G
are
all
inverbile.
In
[Mzk2],
Theorem
9.1,
the
case
of
even
d
is
also
addressed,
as
well
as
the
extent
to
which
these
Fourier
coeﬃcients
are
invertible
in
mixed
characteristic
and
near
inﬁnity
(i.e.,
as
the
elliptic
curve
in
question
degenerates).
Theorem
B
is
proven
by
comparing
the
degree
of
the
line
bundle
(on
the
moduli
stack
of
elliptic
curves)
of
which
the
norm
of
the
Fourier
transform
(i.e.,
the
product
of
its
coeﬃcients)
is
a
section
to
the
degree
of
the
zero
locus
of
this
norm
in
a
neighborhood
of
the
divisor
at
inﬁnity.
A
rather
complicated
(but
entirely
elementary,
“high
school
level”)
calculation
reveals
that
these
two
degrees
coincide.
This
coincidence
of
degrees
implies
that
the
norm
is
therefore
invertible
(in
characteristic
0)
away
from
the
divisor
at
inﬁnity.
This
proof
is
thus
reminiscent
of
the
proof
of
Theorem
A
given
in
[Mzk1],
although
the
calculation
used
to
prove
the
“coincidence
of
degrees”
in
[Mzk2]
is
somewhat
more
complicated
than
the
calculation
that
appears
in
[Mzk1]
in
the
proof
of
Theorem
A.
Finally,
in
[Mzk2],
§10,
we
apply
Theorem
B
as
discussed
in
§2.1:
That
is,
now
that
we
know
(by
Theorem
B)
that
the
theta
convolution
is
invertible,
we
compose
the
comparison
isomorphism
of
Theorem
A
with
the
inverse
of
the
theta
convolution
to
obtain
a
new
“theta-convoluted
comparison
isomorphism.”
Unfortunately,
however,
even
this
new
comparison
isomorphism
is
not
entirely
free
of
Gaussian
poles.
More
precisely,
of
the
various
“points
at
inﬁnity”
of
the
moduli
stack
of
elliptic
curves
equipped
with
the
data
appearing
in
Theorem
B
(i.e.,
η,
G,
H),
those
points
at
inﬁnity
for
which
the
restriction
subgroup
G
is
multiplicative
(i.e.,
coincides
with
the
subgroup
μd
⊆
Gm

Gm
/q
Z
=
E)
satisfy
the
property
that
in
a
neighborhood
of
such
points
at
inﬁnity,
the
theta-convoluted
comparison
40
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
isomorphism
is
free
of
Gaussian
poles.
At
the
other
points
of
inﬁnity
(which,
incidentally,
constitute
the
overwhelming
majority
of
points
at
inﬁnity),
however,
even
the
theta-convoluted
comparison
isomorphism
fails
to
be
free
of
Gaussian
poles.
Thus,
the
theory
of
[Mzk2]
is
still
not
suﬃcient
to
allow
one
to
apply
the
theory
of
[Mzk1]
to
diophantine
geometry
(cf.
also
the
discussion
of
§1.5.1).
