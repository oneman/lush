In
this
paper,
we
develop
the
theory
of
“cuspidalizations”
of
the
étale
fundamental
group
of
a
proper
hyperbolic
curve
over
a
ﬁnite
or
nonarchimedean
mixed-characteristic
local
ﬁeld.
The
ultimate
goal
of
this
theory
is
the
group-theoretic
reconstruction
of
the
étale
fundamental
group
of
an
arbitrary
open
subscheme
of
the
curve
from
the
étale
fundamental
group
of
the
full
proper
curve.
We
then
apply
this
theory
to
show
that
a
certain
absolute
p-adic
version
of
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
holds
for
hyperbolic
curves
“of
Belyi
type”.
This
includes,
in
particular,
aﬃne
hyperbolic
curves
over
a
nonarchimedean
mixed-characteristic
local
ﬁeld
which
are
deﬁned
over
a
number
ﬁeld
and
isogenous
to
a
hyperbolic
curve
of
genus
zero.
Also,
we
apply
this
theory
to
prove
the
analogue
for
proper
hyperbolic
curves
over
ﬁnite
ﬁelds
of
the
version
of
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
that
was
shown
in
[Tama].

Introduction
Let
X
be
a
proper
hyperbolic
curve
over
a
ﬁeld
k
which
is
either
ﬁnite
or
nonarchimedean
local
of
mixed
characteristic;
let
U
⊆
X
be
an
open
subscheme
of
X.
Write
ΠX
for
the
étale
fundamental
group
of
X.
In
this
paper,
we
study
the
extent
to
which
the
étale
fundamental
group
of
U
may
be
group-theoretically
reconstructed
from
ΠX
.
In
§1,
we
show
that
the
abelian
portion
of
the
extension
of
ΠX
determined
by
the
étale
fundamental
group
of
U
may
be
group-theoretically
reconstructed
from
ΠX
[cf.
Theorem
1.16,
(iii)],
and,
moreover,
that
this
construction
has
certain
remarkable
rigidity
properties
[cf.
Propositions
1.15,
(i);
2.6,
(i)].

In
§2,
we
show
that
this
abelian
portion
of
the
extension
is
suﬃcient
to
reconstruct
[in
essence]
the
multiplicative
group
of
the
function
ﬁeld
of
X
[cf.
Theorem
2.5,
(ii)].
In
the
case
of
nonarchimedean
[mixed-characteristic]
local
ﬁelds,
this
already
implies
various
interesting
consequences
in
the
context
of
the
absolute
anabelian
geometry
studied
in
[Mzk5],
[Mzk6],
[Mzk8].
In
particular,
it
implies
that
the
absolute
p-adic
version
of
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
[i.e.,
an
absolute
version
of
[a
certain
portion
of]
the
relative
result
that
appears
as
the
main
result
of
[Mzk4]]
holds
for
hyperbolic
curves
“of
Belyi
type”
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.9;
Corollary
2.12].
This
includes,
in
particular,
hyperbolic
curves
“of
strictly
Belyi
type”,
i.e.,
aﬃne
hyperbolic
curves
over
a
nonarchimedean
[mixed-characteristic]
local
ﬁeld
which
are
deﬁned
over
a
number
ﬁeld
and
isogenous
to
a
hyperbolic
curve
of
genus
zero.
In
particular,
we
obtain
a
new
countable
class
of
“absolute
curves”
[in
the
terminology
of
[Mzk6]],
whose
absoluteness
is,
in
certain
respects,
reminiscent
of
the
absoluteness
of
the
canonical
curves
of
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
discussed
in
[Mzk6]
[cf.
Remark
2.13.1],
but
[in
contrast
to
the
class
of
canonical
curves]
appears
[at
least
from
the
point
of
view
of
certain
circumstantial
evidence]
unlikely
to
be
Zariski
dense
in
most
moduli
spaces
[cf.
Remark
2.13.2].
Finally,
in
§3,
we
apply
the
theory
of
the
weight
ﬁltration
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Kane],
[Mtm]],
together
with
various
generalities
concerning
free
Lie
algebras
[cf.
the
Appendix],
to
develop
various
“higher
order
generalizations”
of
the
theory
of
§1,
2.
In
particular,
we
obtain
various
“higher
order
generalizations”
of
the
“remarkable
rigidity”
referred
to
above
[cf.
Propositions
3.7,
3.9,
especially
Proposition
3.9,
(iii)],
which
we
apply
to
show
that,
relative
to
the
notation
introduced
above,
the
geometrically
pro-l
portion
[where
l
is
a
prime
number
invertible
in
k]
of
the
étale
fundamental
group
of
U
may
be
recovered
from
ΠX
,
at
least
when
U
is
obtained
from
X
by
removing
a
single
k-rational
point
[cf.
Theorem
3.10].
This,
along
with
the
theory
of
§2,
allows
one
to
verify
the
analogue
for
proper
hyperbolic
curves
over
ﬁnite
ﬁelds
of
the
version
of
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
that
was
shown
in
[Tama]
[cf.
Theorem
3.12].

Topological
Groups:
Let
G
be
a
Hausdorﬀ
topological
group,
and
H
⊆
G
a
closed
subgroup.
Let
us
write
Gab
for
the
abelianization
of
G
[i.e.,
the
quotient
of
G
by
the
closed
subgroup
of
G
topologically
generated
by
the
commutators
of
G].
Let
us
write
def
ZG
(H)
=
{g

|
g
·
h
=
h
·
g,
∀
h

for
the
centralizer
of
H
in
G;
NG

=
{g

def
for
the

g

for
the

Note
that:
(i)
ZG

of

(ii)
we
have

H

If
H
=

(respectively,
H
=
CG
(H)),
then
we
shall
say
that
H
is
normally
terminal
(respectively,
commensurably
terminal)
in
G.
Note
that
ZG
(H),
NG
(H)
are
always
closed
in
G,
while
CG
(H)
is
not
necessarily
closed
in

If
G1
,
G2
are
Hausdorﬀ
topological
groups,
then
an
outer
homomorphism
G1

is
deﬁned
to
be
an

of
continuous
homomorphisms
G1

where
two
such
homomorphisms
are
considered
equivalent
if
they

composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
of

.
The
group
of
outer
automorphisms
of
G
[i.e.,
bijective
bicontinuous
outer
homomorphisms
G
→
G]
will
be
denoted
Out(G).
If
G
is
center-free,
then
there
is
a
natural
exact
sequence:
1
→
G
→
Aut(G)
→
Out(G)
→
1
[where
the
homomorphism
G
→
Aut(G)
is
deﬁned
by
letting
G
act
on
G
by
conjugation].
If
G
is
a
proﬁnite
group
such
that,
for
every
open
subgroup
H
⊆
G,
we
have
ZG
(H)
=
{1},
then
we
shall
say
that
G
is
slim.
One
veriﬁes
immediately
that
G
is
slim
if
and
only
if
every
open
subgroup
of
G
is
center-free
[cf.
[Mzk5],
Remark
0.1.3].
If
G
is
a
proﬁnite
group
and
Σ
is
set
of
prime
numbers,
then
we
shall
say
that
G
is
a
pro-Σ
group
if
the
order
of
every
ﬁnite
quotient
group
of
G
is
a
Σ-integer.
If
Σ
=
{l}
is
of
cardinality
one,
then
we
shall
refer
to
a
pro-Σ
group
as
a
pro-l
group.
Curves:
Suppose
that
g
≥
0
is
an
integer.
Then
if
S
is
a
scheme,
a
family
of
curves
of
genus
g
X→S
is
deﬁned
to
be
a
smooth,
proper,
geometrically
connected
morphism
of
schemes
X
→
S
whose
geometric
ﬁbers
are
curves
of
genus
g.
Suppose
that
g,
r
≥
0
are
integers
such
that
2g
−
2
+
r
>
0.
We
shall
denote
the
moduli
stack
of
r-pointed
stable
curves
of
genus
g
(where
we
assume
the
points
to
be
unordered)
by
Mg,r
[cf.
[DM],
[Knud]
for
an
exposition
of
the
theory
of
such
curves;
strictly
speaking,
[Knud]
treats
the
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
Mg,r
determined
by
ordering
the
marked
points].
The
open
substack
Mg,r
⊆
Mg,r
of
smooth
curves
will
be
referred
to
as
the
moduli
stack
of
smooth
r-pointed
stable
curves
of
genus
g
or,
alternatively,
as
the
moduli
stack
of
hyperbolic
curves
of
type
(g,
r).
A
family
of
hyperbolic
curves
of
type
(g,

X→S
is
deﬁned
to
be
a

which
factors
X
→

as
the

of
an

X

onto

of
a

divisor
D
⊆
Y
which
is
ﬁnite
étale
over
S
of
relative
degree
r,
and
a
family
Y

S
of
curves
of
genus
g.
One
checks
easily
that,
if
S
is
normal,
then
the
pair
(Y,
D)
is
unique
up
to
canonical
isomorphism.
(Indeed,
when
S
is
the
spectrum
of
a
ﬁeld,
this
fact
is
well-known
from
the
elementary
theory
of
algebraic
curves.
Next,
we
consider
an
arbitrary
connected
normal
S
on
which
a

l
is
invertible
(which,
by
Zariski
localization,
we
may
assume
without

of

parametrizing

of

of

the

of

since
(by
the

of

S

be
constructed
as
the

in

of
(Y,
D)
since
the
restriction
of
(Y,
D)
to
the
generic
point
of
S
has
already
been
shown
to
be
unique).
Thus,
the
uniqueness
of
(Y,
D)
follows
by
considering
the
classifying
morphism
(associated
to
(Y,

from
S

of

Jacobian
[since
this
covering
is
well-known
to
be
a
scheme,
for
l
suﬃciently
large].)
We
shall
refer
to
Y
(respectively,
D;
D)
as
the
compactiﬁcation
(respectively,

of
cusps;
divisor
of

of

A

that

a

(g,

A

of

X

of

will
be

If
X
is
a

curve
over
a
ﬁeld
K
with
compactiﬁcation
X
⊆

then
we
shall
write
X
cl
;
X
cl+
for
the
sets
of
closed
points
of
X
and
X,
respectively.
If
XK
(respectively,
YL
)
is
a
hyperbolic

over
a
ﬁeld
K
(respectively,
L),
then
we
shall
say
that

to

if
there

ZM
over

induce
ﬁnite

[Indeed,
this

immediately
from

veriﬁed
fact
that

an

that

covering

where
Y
is
a

curve
over
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
K,
then
we
shall
refer
to
X
as
a
hyperbolic
orbicurve
over
K.
[Although
this
deﬁnition
diﬀers
from
the
deﬁnition
of
a
“hyperbolic
orbicurve”
given
in
[Mzk6],
Deﬁnition
2.2,
(ii),
it
follows
immediately
from
a
theorem
of
Bundgaard-Nielsen-Fox
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Namba],
Theorem
1.2.15,
p.
29]
that
these
two
deﬁnitions
are
equivalent.]
If
X

Y
is
a
dominant
morphism
of
hyperbolic
orbicurves,
then
we
shall
refer
to
X

as
a
partial
coarsiﬁcation
morphism
if
the
morphism
induced
by
X
→
Y
on
associated
coarse
spaces
[cf.,
e.g.,
[FC],
Chapter
I,
§4.10]
is
an
isomorphism.
Let
X
be
a
hyperbolic
orbicurve
over
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
of
characteristic
zero;
denote
its
étale
fundamental
group
by
ΔX
.
We
shall
refer
to
the
order
of
the
[manifestly
ﬁnite!]
decomposition
group
of
a

x
of
X
as
the

the

least
common
multiple
of
the
orders
of
the

of

as
the
order
of
X.
Thus,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
X
is
a
hyperbolic
curve
if
and
only
if
the
order
of
X
is
equal
to
1.

Let

N
a

equipped
with
a
continuous

Proof.
In

the

associated

×
X

it
suﬃces
to
verify
the
asserted
isomorphism
in
the
case
of

If
Y

a

then
the

with
coeﬃcients
in
the
étale

of
Y
and
abuts
to
the
étale

of
Xk
.
By
allowing
Y
to
vary,
one
then
veriﬁes
immediately
that
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
every

vanishes
upon

Moreover,
by

one
reduces
immediately
to
the

where

Then
the

Note
that
this

together
with
the
[easily
veriﬁed]
fact
that
G†k
acts
faithfully
on

via
the
cyclotomic

Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
The
portion
of

(ii)
concerning

follows
immediately
from
the
existence
of
the
“homotopy
exact
sequence
associated
to
a
family
of
curves”
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Stix],
Proposition
2.3].
The
slimness
assertion
then
follows
from
assertion
(i)
[applied
to
Π†X
]
and
the
slimness
of
ΔUx
[cf.
the
proofs
of
[Mzk5],
Lemmas
1.3.1,
1.3.10].
As
for
assertion
(iii),
the
slimness
of
ΔUS
,
Π†US
follows
via
the
arguments
given
in
the

proofs
of
[Mzk5],
Lemmas
1.3.1,
1.3.10.
The
existence
of
homomorphisms
ΠUS
→
x∈S
ΠUx
→
DS
as
asserted
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions,
assertion
(ii).
For
x
∈
S,
write
Dx
[US
]
⊆
ΠUS
for
the
decomposition
group
of
x;
Ix
[US
]
⊆
Dx
[US
]
for
the
inertia
subgroup.
Now
it
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
Ix
[US
]
maps
isomorphically
onto
the
copy
MX
in
DS
corresponding
to
the
point
x.
This
implies
the
desired
surjectivity.
Since,
moreover,
it
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
the
cuspidal
subgroup
of
any
cuspidally
central
quotient
of
ΔUS
is
generated
by
the
image
of
the
Ix
[US
],
as
x
ranges
over
the
elements
of
S,
the
ﬁnal
assertion
concerning
the
maximal
cuspidally
central
quotient
of
ΔUS
follows
immediately.
Assertion
(iv)
follows
by
a
similar
argument
to
the
argument
applied
to
the
ﬁnal
portion
of
assertion
(iii).

the

Lemma
1.11.
(Conjugacy
Estimate)
Let
H
⊆
ΔX
be
a
normal
open
subgroup;
a
∈
ΔX
/H
an
element
not
equal
to
the
identity;
N
a
Σ†
-integer
[cf.
§0].
Then
there
exists
a
normal
open
subgroup
H

⊆
ΔX
contained
in
H
such
that
for
any
normal
open
subgroup
H

⊆
ΔX
contained
in
H

and
any
a
∈
ΔX
/H

that
lifts
a,
the
cardinality
of
the
H-conjugacy
class
Conj(a
,
H

)
⊆
ΔX
/H

of
a
in
ΔX
/H

is
divisible
by
N
.
Proof.
In
the
notation
of
the
statement
of
Lemma
1.11,
denote
by
Z(a
,
H

)
⊆
H
the
subgroup
of
elements
δ
∈
H
such
that
δ
·
a
·
δ
−1
=
a
in
ΔX
/H

.
Then
it
is
immediate
that
if
a
is
the
image
of
a
in
ΔX
/H

,
then
Z(a
,
H

)
⊆
Z(a
,
H

),
so
the
cardinality
of
Conj(a
,
H

)
∼
=
H/Z(a
,
H

)
is
divisible
by
the
cardinality


∼


of
Conj(a
,
H
)
=
H/Z(a
,
H
).
Thus,
it
suﬃces
to
ﬁnd
a
normal
open
subgroup
H

⊆
H
such
that
for
any
a
∈
ΔX
/H

that
lifts
a,
the
cardinality
of
Conj(a
,
H

)
is
divisible
by
N
.
To
this
end,
let
us
consider,
for
some
prime
number
l
∈
Σ†
,
the
maximal
pro-l
quotient
H[l]
of
the
abelianization
H
ab
of
H.
Note
that
ΔX
/H
acts
by
conjugation
on
H
ab
,
H[l].
Now
I
claim
that
there
exists
a
[nonzero]
hl
∈
H[l]
such
that
a(hl
)
=
hl
.
Indeed,
if
this
claim
were
false,
then
it
would
follow
that
a
acts
trivially
on
H[l].
But
since
a
induces
a
nontrivial
automorphism
of
the
covering
of
Xk
determined
by
H,
it
follows
that
a
induces
a
nontrivial
automorphism
of
the
l-power
torsion
points
of
the
Jacobian
of
Xk
[since
these
points
are
Zariski
dense
in
this
Jacobian]
—
a
contradiction.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
claim.
Now
let
j
∈
H
be
an
element
that
lifts
the
various
hl
obtained
above
for
the
[ﬁnite
collection
of]
primes
l
that
divide
N
;
let
aX
∈
ΔX
be
an
element
that
lifts
a.
Then
observe
that
for
some
integer
power
M
of
N
that
is
independent
of
the
ab

⊗
(Z/M
Z)
is
nonzero,
for
n
∈
Z
choice
of
aX
,
the
image
of
j
n
·
aX
·
j
−n
·
a−1
X
in
H


Thus,
if
we
take
H

equal
to
the
inverse
image
of
with
nonzero
image
in
Z/N
·
Z.
M
·
H
ab
in
H(⊆
ΔX
),
we
obtain
that
the
intersection
of
the
subgroup
j
Z
⊆
H
with

with
nonzero
Z(a
,
H

)
[where
a
∈
ΔX
/H

lifts
a]
does
not
contain
j
n
,
for
n
∈
Z
Z


But
this
implies
that
the
intersection
(j
)
Z(a
,
H

)
⊆
j
N·Z
,
image
in
Z/N
·
Z.
hence
that
[H
:
Z(a
,
H

)]
is
divisible
by
N
,
as
desired.

use
in
the
following
discussion
to
identify
D

,
ΠL×
[Z

.
Thus,
we
have
fundamental
diag
sections:
ΠUZ


D

;
ΠUZ


D

[cf.
Proposition
1.6,
(iii)].
In
particular,
by
pulling
back
from
Z

to
X

×
X

,
we
obtain
a
surjection:
ΠUX

×X


D
X

×X

Now
if
we
apply
the
natural
outer
(ΔX
/ΔX

)
×
{1}-action
on
ΠUX

×X

to
this
surjection,
it
follows
from
the
deﬁnition
of
“SX

/X
(D
)”
that
we
obtain
a
natural
homomorphism
ΠUX

×X


SX

/X
(D
)X

×X

which
is
easily
veriﬁed
[cf.
Proposition
1.8,
(ii),
(iii)]
to
be
surjective.
Since,
moreover,
the
construction
of
this
surjective
homomorphism
is
manifestly
compatible
with
the
outer
actions
of
Gal(X

/X)
on
both
sides,
we
thus
obtain
a
natural
surjection:
ΠUX×X

SX

/X
(D

)
Now
let
us
denote
by
DX
⊆
ΠUX×X
the
decomposition
group
of
the
subvariety
ι(X)
⊆
X
×
X.
[Thus,
DX
is
well-deﬁned
up
to
conjugation;
here,
we
assume
that
we
have
chosen
a
conjugate
that
maps
to
the
image
of
the
diagonal
embedding
ΠX
→
ΠX×X
via
the
natural
surjection
ΠUX×X

ΠX×X
.]
Observe
that
we
have
a
natural
exact
sequence
1
→
IX
→
DX
→
ΠX
→
1
[where
IX
—
i.e.,
the
inertia
subgroup
of
DX
—
is
deﬁned
so
as
to
make
the
sequence
exact],
together
with
a
natural
isomorphism
IX
∼

MX
.
Also,
we
shall
def

write
DX

=
DX
ΠUX

×X

;
DX

=
DX
ΠUX


.
Since
the
construction
just
carried
out
for
double
primed
objects
may
also
be
carried
out
for
single

we
thus
obtain

(iii)
DX
is
commensurably
terminal
in
Si
,
S∞
∼
=
Πc-ab
UX×X
.
Proof.
First,
we
verify
assertion
(i).
By
Proposition
1.14,
(ii),
we
have
a
natural
∼
isomorphism
Πc-ab
UX×X
→
S∞
,
so
we
may
think
of
α
as
an
automorphism
of
S∞
.
In
light
of
(a);
Proposition
1.8,
(iii),
it
follows
that
α
is
compatible
with
the
natural
surjections
S∞

Si
.
Write
αi
for
the
automorphism
of
Si
induced
by
α.
By
(a),
(b),
it
follows
that
αi
is
an
automorphism
of
the
extension
Si
of
ΠX×X
by
a
product
of
copies
of
MX
which
induces
the
identity
on
both
ΠX×X
and
the
product
of
copies
of
MX
[cf.
the
deﬁnition
by
a
certain
ﬁber
product
of
the
symmetrized
fundamental
extension
Si
].
[Here,
we
note
that
the
fact
that
αi
induces
the
identity
on
each
copy
of
MX
follows
by
considering
the
non-torsion
[cf.
Propositions
1.2,
(ii);
1.6,
(i),
(ii)]
extension
class
determined
by
that
copy
of
MX
[which
is
preserved
by
αi
!],
together
with
the
fact
that
αi
induces
the
identity
on
the
second
cohomology
groups
of
open
subgroups
of
ΔX×X
with
coeﬃcients
in
MX
.]
Thus,
up
to
cyclotomically
inner
∧
automorphisms,
αi
arises
from
a
collection
of
elements
of
(ki×
)
,
where
ki
is
some
ﬁnite
Galois
extension
of
k
[cf.
Proposition
1.4,
(ii)],
one
corresponding
to
each
copy
of
MX
.
Moreover,
since
these
copies
of
MX
are
permuted
by
the
action
of
ΠX×X
by
conjugation,
it
follows
that
[up
to
cyclotomically
inner
automorphisms]
∧
∧
∧
αi
arises
from
a
single
element
of
(ki×
)
,
which
in
fact
belongs
to
(k
×
)
(⊆
(ki×
)
)
[as
one
sees
by
considering
the
conjugation
action
via
the
“Gk
portion”
of
ΠX×X
].
On
the
other
hand,
since
the
αi
form
a
compatible
system
of
automorphisms
of
the
∧
Si
,
it
follows
from
Proposition
1.9,
(iii),
that
this
element
of
(k
×
)
must
be
equal
to
1,
as
desired.
Next,
to
verify
assertion
(ii),
let
us
observe
that
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
ΔX
is
commensurably
terminal
in
ΔX×X
.
But
this
follows
immediately
from
the
fact
that
ΔX
is
slim
[cf.
Proposition
1.8,
(i)].
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
Clearly,
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
DX
is
commensurably
terminal
in
Si
.
By
assertion
(ii),
to
verify
this
commensurable
terminality,
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
the
[manifestly
abelian]
cuspidal
subgroup
Hi
⊆
Si
[i.e.,
relative
to
the
natural
surjection
Si

ΠX×X
]
satisﬁes
the
following
property:
Every
h
∈
Hi
such
that
hδ
−
h
∈
DX
,
for
all
δ
in
some
open
subgroup
J
of
DX
,
satisﬁes
h
∈
DX
.
But
this
property
follows
immediately
[cf.
the
deﬁnition
by
a
certain
ﬁber
product
of
the
symmetrized
fundamental
extension
Si
]
from
the
fact
that,
for
J
suﬃciently
small,
the
J-module
Hi
/(DX
Hi
)
is
isomorphic
to
a
direct
product
of
a
ﬁnite
number
of
copies
of
MX
.

Theorem

(Reconstruction
of
Maximal
Cuspidally
Abelian
Quotients)
Let
X,
Y
be
hyperbolic
curves
over
a
ﬁnite
or
nonarchimedean
local
ﬁeld;
denote
the
base
ﬁelds
of
X,
Y
by
kX
,
kY
,
respectively.
Let
ΣX
(respectively,
ΣY
)
be
a
set
of
prime
numbers
that
contains
at
least
one
prime
number
that
is
invertible
in
kX
(respectively,
kY
);
write
ΔX
(respectively,
ΔY
)
for
the
maximal
cuspidally
pro-Σ†X
(respectively,
pro-Σ†Y
)
quotient
of
the
maximal
pro-ΣX
(respectively,
pro-ΣY
)
quotient
of
the
tame
fundamental
group
of
XkX
(respectively,
YkY
)
[where
“tame”
is
with
respect
to
the
complement
of
XkX
(respectively,
YkY
)
in
its
canonical
compactiﬁcation],
and
ΠX
(respectively,
ΠY
)
for
the
corresponding
quotient
of
the
étale
fundamental
group
of
X
(respectively,
Y
).
Let
∼
α
:
ΠX
→
ΠY
be
an
isomorphism
of
proﬁnite
groups.
Then:
(i)
We
have
Σ†X
=
Σ†Y
;
write
Σ†
=
Σ†X
=
Σ†Y
.
Moreover,
kX
is
a
ﬁnite
ﬁeld
if
and
only
if
kY
is;
α
preserves
the
decomposition
groups
of
cusps;
X
is
of
type
(g,
r)
[where
g,
r
≥
0
are
integers
such
that
2g
−
2
+
r
>
0]
if
and
only
if
Y
is
of
type
(g,
r).
Finally,
if
kX
,
kY
are
nonarchimedean
local,
then
their
residue
characteristics
coincide.
def
(ii)
α
is
compatible
with
the
natural
quotients
ΠX

GkX
,
ΠY

GkY
.
(iii)
Assume
that
X,
Y
are
proper.
Denote

]
abelian
quotients
[cf.
Proposition
1.14].

[cf.
Proposition
1.12,

the
vertical
arrows
are
the
natural
surjections.
Finally,
the
correspondence
α
→
αc-ab
is
functorial
[up
to
cuspidally
inner
automorphisms]
with
respect
to
α.
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertions
(i),
(ii).
Note
that
kX
is
ﬁnite
if
and
only
if,
for
every
open
subgroup
H
⊆
ΠX
,
the
quotient
of
the
abelianization
H
ab
by
the
closure
of
the
torsion
subgroup
of
H
ab
is
topologically
cyclic
[cf.
[Tama],
Proposition
3.3,
(ii)];
a
similar
statement
holds
for
kY
,
ΠY
.
Thus,
kX
is
ﬁnite
if
and
only
if
kY
is.
Now
suppose
that
kX
,
kY
are
ﬁnite.
Then
assertion
(ii)
also
follows
from
[Tama],
26
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
Proposition
3.3,
(ii).
The
fact
that
Σ†X
=
Σ†Y
then
follows
from
the
following
observation:
The
subset
Σ†X
⊆
Primes
is
the
subset
on
which
the
function
Primes
l
→
dimQl
((ΔX
)ab
⊗
Ql
)
attains
its
maximum
value
[cf.
[Tama],
Proposition
3.1];
a
similar
statement
holds
for
Y
.
Now
by
considering
the
respective
outer
actions
of
GkX
,
GkY
on
the
maximal
pro-l
quotients
of
ΔX
,
ΔY
,
for
some
l
∈
Σ†
,
we
obtain
that
α
preserves
the
decomposition
groups
of
cusps
[hence
that
X
is
of
type
(g,
r)
if
and
only
if
Y
is
of
type
(g,
r)],
by
[Mzk9],
Corollary
2.7,
(i).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertions
(i),
(ii)
in
the
ﬁnite
ﬁeld
case.
Next,
let
us
assume
that
kX
,
kY
are
nonarchimedean
local.
Then
the
portion
of
assertion
(i)
concerning
ΣX
=
Σ†X
,
ΣY
=
Σ†Y
follows
by
considering
the
cohomological
dimension
of
ΠX
,
ΠY
—
cf.,
e.g.,
Proposition
1.3,
(ii)
[in
the
proper
case].
def
As
for
assertion
(ii),
if
the
cardinality
of
Σ
=
Σ†
is
≥
2,
then
assertion
(ii)
follows
from
the
evident
pro-Σ
analogue
of
[Mzk5],
Lemma
1.3.8;
if
the
cardinality
of
Σ
is
1,
then
assertion
(ii)
follows
from
Lemma
1.17,
(c),
(d)
below.
Now
the
portion
of
assertion
(i)
concerning
the
residue
characteristics
of
kX
,
kY
follows
from
assertion
(ii)
and
[Mzk5],
Proposition
1.2.1,
(i);
the
fact
that
α
preserves
the
decomposition
groups
of
cusps
[hence
that
X
is
of
type
(g,
r)
if
and
only
if
Y
is
of
type
(g,
r)]
follows
from
[Mzk9],
Corollary
2.7,
(i).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertions
(i),
(ii)
in
the
nonarchimedean
local
ﬁeld
case.
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
It
follows
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
α
induces
∼

→
X,
ZY
→
Y
are
diagonal
an
isomorphism
MX

moreover,

Y

→
Y

arise
from
open
subgroups
of
ΠX
,
ΠY
that
correspond
via
α,
then
α
induces
an


,
that
preserves
the
extension
classes
associated
to
fundamental
extensions
of
ΠZX


ΠZY
[cf.
Proposition
1.6,
(i)].
In
particular,
if
D
(respectively,
E
)
is
a
fundamental

(respectively,
ΠZY
),
then
α
induces
an
isomorphism
extension
of
ΠZX

ΠZ

already

which
is

with
the

α,
and,
moreover,
uniquely
determined,
up
to

phisms,
and
the
action
of
(kX
)
(respectively,
(kY×
)
)
[cf.
Proposition
1.4,
(ii)].
On
the
other
hand,
by
allowing
X

,
Y

to
vary,
taking
symmetrizations
of
the
fundamental
extensions
involved
[which
may
be
constructed
entirely
group-theoretically!],
and
making
use
of
the
vertical
morphism
in
the
center
of
the
diagram
of
Proposition
1.9,
(ii)
[again
an
object
which
may
be
constructed
entirely
group-theoretically!],
it
follows
from
Proposition
1.9,
(iii),
that
the
indeterminacy
of
the
isomorphism

∼
×
∧
D



arising
from
the
action
of
(kX

,
(kY×
)
“converges
to
the
identity
inde∼
terminacy”
[i.e.,
by
taking
D

→
E

to
arise
as
just
described
from
an

where
the
open
subgroups
ΠX

⊆
ΠX

,
ΠY

⊆
ΠY

are
suﬃciently
small].
Thus,
in
light
of
the
manifest
functoriality
of
the
vertical
morphism
in
the
center
of
the
diagram
of
Proposition
1.9,
(ii)
[the
detailed
explication
of
which,
in
terms
of
various
commutative
diagrams,
is
a
routine
task
which
we
leave
to
the
reader!],
we
obtain
an
isomorphism
∼
{Si
}
→
{Tj
}
of
pro-symmetrized
fundamental
extensions
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.10,
(iii)]
of
ΠX×X
,
ΠY
×Y
,
respectively,
which
arises
from
α
and
is
completely
determined
up
to
cyclotomically
inner
automorphisms.
Here,
we
pause
to
note
that
although
in
the
construction
of
the
symmetrization
of
a
fundamental
extension
D

(respectively,
E

),
one
must,
a
priori,
contend
with
a
certain
indeterminacy
with
respect
to
ΔX

×{1}(respectively,
ΔY

×
{1}-)inner
automorphisms
[cf.,
e.g.,
Proposition
1.9,
(ii)],
in
fact,
by
allowing
X

,
Y

to
vary,
this
indeterminacy
also
“converges
to
the
identity
indeterminacy”
[cf.
Remark
1.9.1].
Thus,
in
summary,
α
induces
an
isomorphism
[well-deﬁned
up
to
cyclotomically
[or,
alternatively,
cuspidally]
inner
automorphisms]
∼
S∞
→
T∞
of
pro-fundamental
extensions
of
ΠX×X
,
ΠY
×Y
,
respectively.
Moreover,
by
applying
the
fact
that
the
left-hand
square
of
the
commutative
diagram
of
Proposition

”
1.12,
(ii),
is
cartesian,
together
with
the
fact
that
the
“canonical
section”
of
“ζ=
that
appears
in
Proposition
1.12,
(iii),
is
completely
determined
[cf.
Proposition
1.12,
(v);
Lemma
1.11]
by
the
condition
that
it
lie
under
an
arbitrary
“equivariant

section”
[cf.
Proposition
1.12,
(iv)]
of
the
“ζ=

associated
to
coverings
“X

→
X

”
arising
from
arbitrarily
small
open
subgroups
ΠX

⊆
ΠX
,
it
follows
that
the
isomor∼
phism
S∞

T∞
just
obtained
is
compatible
with
the
pro-fundamental
inclusions
DX
→
S∞
,
DY
→
T∞
.
In
particular,
by
Proposition
1.14,
(ii)
[cf.
also
Proposition
1.12,
(i)],
we
conclude
that
α
induces
an
isomorphism
[well-deﬁned

which
is
compatible
with
the
natural
inclusions
DX

Πc-ab
UX×X
,
DY
→
ΠUY
×Y
.
Finally,
the
functoriality
of
this
isomorphism
follows
from
the
naturality
of
its
construction.

Remark
1.16.1.
It
follows
immediately
from
the
naturality
of
the
constructions
used
in
the
proof
of
Theorem
1.16,
(iii),
that
when
“α”
arises
from
an
isomorphism
∼
of
schemes
X

Y
,
the
resulting
αc-ab
of
Theorem
1.16,

coincides
with
the
morphism
induced
on
fundamental
groups
by
the
resulting

Lemma
1.17.
(Normal
Subgroups
of
the
Absolute
Galois
Group
of
a
Nonarchimedean
Local
Field)
Let
k
be
a
nonarchimedean
local
ﬁeld
of
residue
characteristic
p;
write
Gk
for
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
k.
Also,
let
us
write
I
⊆
Gk
for
the
inertia
subgroup
of
Gk
and
W
⊆
I
for
the
wild
inertia
subgroup.
[Here,
we
recall
that
W
is
the
unique
Sylow
pro-p
subgroup
of
I.]
Let
H
⊆
Gk
be
a
closed
subgroup
that
satisﬁes
[at
least]
one
of
the
following
four
conditions:
(a)
H
is
a
ﬁnite
group.
(b)
H
commutes
with
W
.
(c)
H
is
a
pro-prime-to-p
group
[i.e.,
the
order
of
every
ﬁnite
quotient
group
of
H
is
prime
to
p]
that
is
normal
in
Gk
.
(d)
H
is
a
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated
pro-p
group
that
is
normal
in
Gk
.
Then
H
=
{1}.
Proof.
Indeed,
suppose
that
H
satisﬁes
condition
(a).
Then
the
fact
that
H
=
{1}
follows
from
[NSW],
Corollary
12.1.3,
Theorem
12.1.7.
Now
suppose
that
H
satisﬁes
condition
(b).
Then
by
the
well-known
functorial
isomorphism
[arising
from
local
class
ﬁeld
theory]
between
the
additive
group
underlying
a
ﬁnite
ﬁeld
extension
of
k
that
corresponds
to
an
open
subgroup
J
⊆
Gk
and
the
tensor
product
with
Qp
of
the
image
of
W
J
in
the
abelianization
J
ab
,
it
follows
immediately
that
the
conjugation
action
of
H
on
W
is
nontrivial,
whenever
H
is
nontrivial.
Thus
we
conclude
again
that
H
=
{1}.
Next,
suppose
that
H
satisﬁes
condition
(c).
Then
since
H,
W
are
both
normal
in
Gk
,
it
follows
[by
considering
commutators
of
elements
of
H
with
elements
of
W
]
that
arbitrary
elements
of
H
commute
with
arbitrary
elements
of
W
.
In
particular,
H
satisﬁes
condition
(b),
so
we
conclude
yet
again
that
H
=
{1}.
Finally,
we
assume
that
H
is
nontrivial
and
satisﬁes
condition
(d).
Then
I
claim
that
H
has
trivial
image
Im(H)
in
Gk
/W
.
Indeed,
since
I/W
,
Im(H)
are
normal
in
Gk
/W
,
and,
moreover,
I/W
is
pro-prime-to-p,
it
follows
that
these
two
groups
commute.
On
the
other
hand,
since,
as
is
well-known,
Gk
/I
acts
faithfully
[by
conjugation,
via
the
cyclotomic
character]
on
I/W
,
it
thus
follows
that
Im(H)
is
trivial,
as
asserted.
Thus,
H
⊆
W
.
Since
[as
in
well-known
—
cf.,
e.g.,
the
proof
of
[Mzk4],
Lemma
15.6]
W
is
a
free
pro-p
group
of
inﬁnite
rank,
we
thus
conclude
that
there
exists
an
open
subgroup
U
⊆
W
[so
U
is
also
a
free
pro-p
group
of
inﬁnite
rank]
containing
H
such
that
the
natural
map
H
ab
⊗
Fp
→
U
ab
⊗
Fp
is
injective,
but
not
surjective.
Then
it
follows
immediately
from
the
well-known
theory
of
free
pro-p
groups
that
there
exists
a
set
of
free
topological
generators
{ξi
}i∈I
[so
the
index
set
I
is
inﬁnite]
of
U
such
that
for
some
ﬁnite
subset
J
⊆
I,
ABSOLUTE
ANABELIAN
CUSPIDALIZATIONS
29
the
elements
{ξj
}j∈J
lie
in
and
topologically
generate
H.
On
the
other
hand,
since
H
is
normal
in
U
,
it
follows
from
the
well-known
structure
of
free
pro-p
groups
that
we
obtain
a
contradiction.
This
completes
the
proof
of
Lemma
1.17.

1.18.
In

situation
of
Theorem
1.16,
(i),
(ii),
suppose
further
that

then
we

say
that
X

Σ-separated.
(ii)
If
the

induces
a
bijection
between
the

then
we
shall
say
that
α

quasi-point-theoretic.
If
α

Suppose
further

if
the

Frobenius
element
of
GkY
.
Remark
1.18.1.
In
the
ﬁnite
ﬁeld
case,
when
Σ†
=
Primes†
,
the
Frobenius
element
of
GkX
may
be
characterized
as
in
[Tama],
Proposition
3.4,
(i),
(ii);
a
similar
statement
holds
for
the
Frobenius
element
of
GkY
.
[Moreover,
in
the
proper
case,
the
Frobenius
element
of
GkX
may
be
characterized
as
the
element
of
GkX
that
acts
on
MX
via
multiplication
by
the
cardinality
of
kX
,
i.e.,
the
cardinality
of
H
1
(GkX
,
MX
)
plus
1.]
Thus,
when
Σ†
=
Primes†
,
any
α
as
in
Theorem
1.16,
(i),
(ii),
is
automatically
Frobenius-preserving.
Remark
1.18.2.
Let
us
suppose
that
we
are
in
the
situation
of
Deﬁnition
1.18,
and
that
the
base
ﬁelds
kX
,
kY
are
ﬁnite.
Let
us
refer
to
as
a
quasi-section
[of
ΠX

GkX
]
any
closed
subgroup
D
⊆
ΠX
[i.e.,
such
as
a
decomposition
group
of
a
point
∈
X
cl
]
that
maps
isomorphically
onto
an
open
subgroup
of
GkX
.
Let
us
refer
to
a
quasi-section
of
ΠX

GkX
as
a
subdecomposition
group
if
it
is
contained
in
some
decomposition
group
of
a
point
∈
X
cl
.
(i)
Since
X
is
not
necessarily
Σ-separated,
it
is
not
necessarily
the
case
that
decomposition
groups
of
points
∈
X
cl
are
commensurably
terminal
in
ΠX
[cf.
Proposition
2.6,
(ii),
below].
On
the
other
hand,
if
D
⊆
ΠX
is
a
quasi-section,
and
we
30
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
def
write
E
=
CΠX
(D)
⊆
ΠX
for
the
commensurator
of
D
in
ΠX
[cf.
§0],
then
one
veriﬁes
immediately
E
is
also
a
quasi-section.
[Indeed,
by
considering
the
projection
ΠX

GkX
,
it
follows
immediately
that
every
element
of
E
centralizes
some
open
subgroup
D
⊆
D;
on
the
other
hand,
by
considering
the
well-known
properties
of
the
action
of
open
subgroups
of
Gk
on
abelianizations
of
open
subgroups
of
ΔX
[i.e.,
more
precisely,
the
“Riemann
hypothesis
for
abelian
varieties
over
ﬁnite
ﬁelds”
—
cf.,
e.g.,
[Mumf],
p.
206],
it
follows
that
every
centralizer
of
D
in
ΔX
is
trivial,
i.e.,
that
E
ΔX
=
{1}.]
(ii)
It
is
immediate
that
any
maximal
subdecomposition
group
of
ΠX
is,
in
fact,
a
decomposition
group
of
some
point
∈
X
cl
.
On
the
other
hand,
since
X
is
not
necessarily
Σ-separated,
it
is
not
clear
whether
or
not
every
decomposition
group
of
a
point
∈
X
cl
is
necessarily
a
maximal
subdecomposition
group.
If
X,
Y
are
Σ-separated,
then
the
arguments
of
[Tama],
Corollary
2.10,
Proposition
3.8,
yield
a
“group-theoretic”
characterization
of
the
subdecomposition
groups
[hence
also
of
the
maximal
subdecomposition
groups,
i.e.,
the
decomposition
groups
of
points
∈
X
cl
]
of
ΠX
,
ΠY
in
terms
of
the
actions
of
the
Frobenius
elements.
That
is
to
say,
if
X,
Y
are
Σ-separated,
then
any
Frobenius-preserving
isomorphism
α
is
[quasi-]pointtheoretic.
(iii)
Nevertheless,
as
was
pointed
out
to
the
author
by
A.
Tamagawa,
even
if
X,
Y
are
not
necessarily
Σ-separated,
it
is
still
possible
to
conclude,
essentially
from
the
arguments
of
[Tama],
Corollary
2.10,
Proposition
3.8,
that:
Any
Frobenius-preserving
isomorphism
α
is
quasi-point-theoretic.
Indeed,
it
suﬃces
to
give
a
“group-theoretic”
characterization
of
the
quasi-sections
D
⊆
ΠX
which
are
decomposition
groups
of
points
∈
X
cl
.
We
may
assume
[for
def
simplicity]
without
loss
of
generality
that
X,
Y
are
proper.
Write
E
=
CΠX
(D);
kD
,
kE
for
the
ﬁnite
extension
ﬁelds
of
kX
determined
by
D,
E.
Let
H
⊆
ΔX
be
a
characteristic
open
subgroup;
denote
by
Y
→
X
the
covering
determined
by
the
open
subgroup
E
·
H
⊆
ΠX
.
Then
it
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
a
“decomposition
group”
that
it
suﬃces
to
give
a
“group-theoretic”
criterion
for
the
condition
that
Y
(kD
)
contain
a
point
whose
ﬁeld
of
deﬁnition
[which
is,
a
priori,
some
subextension
in
kD
of
kE
]
is
equal
to
kD
.
In
[Tama],
the
Lefschetz
trace
formula
is
applied
to
compute
the
cardinality
of
Y
(kD
).
On
the
other
hand,
if
we
use
the
superscript
“ﬂd-def”
to
denote
the
subset
of
points
whose
ﬁeld
of
deﬁnition
is
equal
to
the
ﬁeld
given
in
parentheses,
and
“|
−
|”
to
denote
the
cardinality
of
a
ﬁnite
set,
then
for
any
subextension
k

⊆
kD
of
kE
,
we
have
|Y
(k

)|
=

|Y
(k

)ﬂd-def
|
k
[where
k

⊆
k

ranges
over
the
subextensions
of
kE
].
In
particular,
by
applying
induction
on
[k

:
kE
],
one
concludes
immediately
from
the
above
formula
that
|Y
(k

)ﬂd-def
|
may
be
computed
from
|Y
(k

)|
for
subextensions
k

⊆
k

of
kE
[while
|Y
(k

)|
may
be
computed,
as
in
[Tama],
from
the
Lefschetz
trace
formula].
This
ABSOLUTE
ANABELIAN
CUSPIDALIZATIONS
31
yields
the
desired
“group-theoretic”
characterization
of
the
decomposition
groups
of
ΠX
.
Remark
1.18.3.
Note
that
in
the
ﬁnite
ﬁeld
case,
if
α
as
in
Theorem
1.16,
(i),
(ii),
is
Frobenius-preserving,
then
the
cardinalities,
hence
also
the
characteristics,
of
kX
,
kY
coincide.
Indeed,
this
follows
immediately
by
reducing
to
the
proper
case
via
Theorem
1.16,
(i),
and
considering
the
actions
of
GkX
,
GkY
[cf.
Theorem
1.16,
∼
(ii)]
on
MX
,
MY
[which
are
compatible
relative
to
the
isomorphism
MX
→
MY
induced
by
α].
Now
we
return
to
the
notation
of
the
discussion
preceding
Theorem
1.16.
Observe
that
the
automorphism
τ
:X
×X
→
X
×X
given
by
switching
the
two
factors
induces
an
outer
automorphism
of
ΠUX×X
.
Moreover,
by
choosing
the
basepoints
used
to
form
the
various
fundamental
groups
involved
in
an
appropriate
fashion,
it
follows
that
there
exists
an
automorphism
Πτ
:
ΠUX×X
→
ΠUX×X
among
those
automorphisms
induced
by
τ
[i.e.,
all
of
which
are
related
to
one
another
by
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism]
which
induces
the
automorphism
on
ΠX×X
=
ΠX
×Gk
ΠX
given
by
switching
the
two
factors;
preserves
the
subgroup
DX
⊆
ΠUX×X
;
and
preserves
and
induces
the
identity
automorphism
on
the
subgroup
IX
⊆
DX
(⊆
ΠUX×X
).
Note
that
by
the
slimness
of
Proposition
1.8,
(i),
together
with
the
well-known
commensurable
terminality
of
DX
⊆
ΠUX×X
in
ΠUX×X
[cf.,
e.g.,
[the
proof
of]
[Mzk5],
Lemma
1.3.12],
it
follows
that,
at
least
when
Σ
=
Primes,
these
three
conditions
[are
more
than
suﬃcient
to]
uniquely
determine
Πτ
,
up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
arising
from
IX
;
one
then
obtains
a
natural
Πτ
for
arbitrary
Σ
[well-deﬁned
up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
arising
from
IX
]
by
taking
the
automorphism
induced
on
the
appropriate
quotients
by
“Πτ
in
the
case
Σ
=
Primes”.
Proposition
1.19.
(Switching
the
Two
Factors)
The
automorphism
c-ab
:
Πc-ab
Πc-ab
τ
UX×X
→
ΠUX×X
induced
by
Πτ
is
the
unique
automorphism
of
the
proﬁnite
group
Πc-ab
UX×X
,
up
to
composition
with
a
cuspidally
inner
automorphism,
that
satisﬁes
the
following
two
conditions:
(a)
it
preserves
the
quotient
Πc-ab
UX×X

ΠX×X
and
induces
on
this
quotient
the
automorphism
on
ΠX×X
=
ΠX
×Gk
ΠX
given
by
switching
the
two
factors;
(b)
it
preserves
the
image
of
IX
⊆
DX
→
Πc-ab
UX×X
.
Proof.
This
follows
immediately
from
Proposition
1.15,
(i).

We
maintain
the
notation
of
§1
[i.e.,
the
discussion
preceding
Theorem
1.16].
If
x
∈
X
cl
,
then
we
shall
denote
by
Dx
⊆
ΠX
the
decomposition
group
of
x
[well-deﬁned
up
to
conjugation
in
ΠX
].
If
x
∈
X(k),
then
Dx
determines
a
section
sx
:
Gk
→
ΠX
[which
is
well-deﬁned
as
a
geometrically
outer
homomorphism].
Next,
let
S
⊆
X
cl
be
a
ﬁnite
set.
If
n
is
a

[cf.
§0],
then
the
Kummer

[where
Gm

Gm
is
the
n-th

map;
μn
is
deﬁned
so
as
to
make
the
sequence
exact]
on
the
étale
site
of
X
determines
a
homomorphism
Pic(X)
→
H
2
(ΔX
,
μn
)
[where
Pic(X)
is
the
Picard

of

Now
there
is
a
unique
isomorphism
∼
μn

MX
such
that
the
homomorphism
Pic(X)

)
sends
line

of

to
the

determined

via
the

(iii)],
then
it
follows
that
the
image
of
Dx
[US
]
in
Πc-cn
US
may
be
thought
of
as
the
image
of
Dx
[US
]
in
DS
.
If,
moreover,
we
assume,
for
simplicity,
that
x
∈
X(k),
S
⊆
X(k),
then
this
image
of
Dx
[US
]
in
DS
amounts
to
a
section
of
DS

ΠX

Gk
lying
over
the
section
sx
of
ΠX

Gk
.
Since
DS
is
deﬁned
as
a
certain
ﬁber
product,
this
section
is
equivalent
to
a
collection
of
sections
[regarded
as
cyclotomically
outer
homomorphisms]
γy,x
:
Gk
→
Dy,x
[where
y
ranges
over
the
points
of
S].
[Here,
we
note
that
it
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions
that,
as
the
notation
suggests,
γy,x
depends
only
on
x,
y
—
i.e.,
that
γy,x
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
S.]
That
is
to
say,
from
this
point
of
view,
Proposition

(iii),
may
be
regarded
as
stating
that:

The

of
the
value
of
a

OU
S
at
x
∈

may
be
computed
from
its
Kummer
class,
as
soon
as
one
knows
the
sections
γy,x
:
Gk

Dy,x
,
for
y

S.
Also,
before
proceeding,
we
note
that
an
arbitrary
section
of


Gk
diﬀers
[as
a
cyclotomically

from
γy,x
by
the
action
of
an
element
of

Thus,
the

may
be
regarded
as
a

we
observe
that

Deﬁnition
2.2.
For
x,
y
∈
X(k),
we
shall
refer
to
the
section
[regarded
as
a
cyclotomically
outer
homomorphism]
γy,x
:
Gk
→
Dy,x
as
the
Green’s
trivialization
of
D
at
(y,
x).
If
D
is
a
divisor
on
X
supported
in
the
subset
of
k-rational
points
X(k)
⊆
X
cl
,
then
multiplication
of
the
various
Green’s
trivializations
for
the
points
in
the
support
of
D
determines
a
section
[regarded
as
a
cyclotomically
outer
homomorphism]
γD,x
:
Gk
→
DD,x
which
we
shall
refer
to
as
the
Green’s
trivialization
of
D
at
(D,
x).
[Note
that
the
deﬁnition
of
γD,x
generalizes
immediately
to
the
case
where
the
divisor
D,
but
not
necessarily
the
points
in
its
support,
is
rational
over
k
—
cf.
Remark
1.10.1.]
Remark
2.2.1.
The
terminology
of
Deﬁnition
2.2,
is
intended
to
suggest
the
similarity
between
the
γy,x
of
the
present
discussion
and
the
“Green’s
functions”
that
occur
in
the
theory
of
bipermissible
metrics
—
cf.,
e.g.,
[MB],
§4.11.4.
Remark
2.2.2.
Note
that
the
Green’s
trivializations
are
symmetric
with
respect
of
Proposition
1.19.
to
the
involution
of
D
induced
by
the
automorphism
Πc-ab
τ
Indeed,
relative
to
the
natural
projections
ΠUX×X

Πc-ab
UX×X

D
the
Green’s
trivialization
at
(y,
x)
is
simply
the
section
of
D

Gk
arising
[by
composition]
from
the
section
of
ΠUX×X

Gk
determined
by
the
decomposition
group
of
the
point
(y,
x)
∈
UX×X
(k).
Thus,
the
asserted
symmetry
of
the
Green’s
is
compatible
with
Πτ
,
together
with
trivializations
follows
from
the
fact
that
Πc-ab
τ
the
evident
fact
that
[by
“transport
of
structure”]
Πτ
maps
the
decomposition
group
of
(y,
x)
∈
UX×X
(k)
isomorphically
onto
the
decomposition
group
of
(x,
y)
∈
UX×X
(k).
If
d
∈
Z,
denote
by
J
d
the
subscheme
of
the
Picard
scheme
of
X
that
paramedef
trizes
line
bundles
of
degree
d;
write
J
=
J
0
.
Thus,
J
d
is
a
torsor
over
J.
Note
that
there
is
a
natural
morphism
X
→
J
1
[given
by
assigning
to
a
point
of
X
the
line
bundle
of
degree
1
determined
by
the
point].
Thus,
the
basepoint
of
X
[already
chosen
in
§1]
determines
a
basepoint
of
J
1
.
At
the
level
of
“geometrically
pro-Σ”
étale
fundamental
groups,
this
morphism
induces
a
surjective
homomorphism
ΠX

ΠJ
1
36
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
whose
kernel
is
the
kernel
of
the
maximal
abelian
quotient
ΔX

Δab
X
.
In
particular,
for
x
∈
X(k),
the
section
sx
determines
a
section
tx
:
Gk
→
ΠJ
1
.
Note
that
applying
the
“change
of
structure
group”
given
by
the
“multiplication
by
d
map”
on
J
to
the
J-torsor
J
1
yields
the
J-torsor
J
d
.
[Indeed,
this
follows
by
considering
the
group
structure
of
the
Picard
scheme.]
Thus,
we
obtain
a
morphism
J
1
→
J
d
whose
induced
morphism
on
fundamental
groups
ΠJ
1
→
ΠJ
d
determines
an
isomorphism
of
ΠJ
d
with
the
push-forward
of
the
extension
ΠJ
1
[i.e.,
ab
ab
of
Gk
by
ΔJ
1
∼
=
Δab
X
]
via
the
homomorphism
ΔX
→
ΔX
given
by
multiplication
by
d.
When
d
≥
1,
the
group
structure
on
the
Picard
scheme
also
determines
a
morphism

ΠJ
1
→
ΠJ
d
[where
the
product
is
a
ﬁber
product
over
Gk
of
d
factors
of
ΠJ
1
]
which
determines
an
isomorphism
of
ΠJ
d
with
the
push-forward

ab
of
theabextension
constituted
by
the
ﬁber
product
via
the
homomorphism
ΔX
→
ΔX
[i.e.,
from
a
product
of
d
ab
ab
copies
of
ΔX
to
ΔX
given
by
adding
up
the
d
components].
Moreover,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
when
d
≥
1,
these
two
constructions
of
“ΠJ
d
”
from
ΠJ
1
yield
groups
that
are
naturally
isomorphic.
Thus,
by
applying
the
various
homomorphisms
induced
on
fundamental
groups
by
the
group
structure
of
the
Picard
scheme,
it
follows
that
if
D
is
any
divisor
of
degree
d
on
X
whose
support
lies
in
the
set
of
k-rational
points
X(k)
⊆
X
cl
,
then
D
determines
a
section
tD
:
Gk
→
ΠJ
d
which
may
be
constructed
entirely
group-theoretically
from
the
“tx
”,
where
x
∈
X(k)
ranges
over
the
points
in
the
support
of
D.
In
particular,
if
D
is
of
degree
0,
then
the
section
tD
:
Gk
→
ΠJ
may
be
compared
with
the
identity
section
of
ΠJ
to
obtain
a
cohomology
class:
ηD
∈
H
1
(Gk
,
Δab
X)
Now
we
have
the
following
well-known
result:
Proposition
2.3.
(Points
and
Galois
Sections)
Suppose
that
Σ
=
Primes.
Then,
in
the
notation
of
the
above
discussion:
(i)
The
divisor
D
is
principal
if
and
only
if
ηD
=
0.
(ii)
The
map
x
→
Dx
from
X
cl
to
conjugacy
classes
of
closed
subgroups
of
ΠX
is
injective,
i.e.,
X
is
Primes-separated.
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
By
well-known
general
nonsense
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Naka],
Claim
(2.2);
[NTs],
Lemma
(4.14);
[Mzk4],
the
Remark
preceding
Deﬁnition
6.2],
there
is
a
natural
isomorphism
∼
∧
H

(k,
Δab
X
)
→
J(k)
(⊇
J(k))
ABSOLUTE
ANABELIAN
CUSPIDALIZATIONS
37
[where
the
“∧”
denotes
the
proﬁnite
completion]
which
maps
ηD
to
the
element
of
J(k)
determined
by
D.
[Here,
we
recall
that
this
natural
isomorphism
arises
by
considering
the
long
exact
sequence
obtained
by
applying
the
functors
H
∗
(Gk
,
−)
to
the
short
exact
sequence
of
Gk
-modules
1
→
J(k)[n]
→
J(k)
→
J(k)
→
1
—
where
n
is
a
positive
integer;
the
morphism
J(k)
→
J(k)
is
the
“multiplication
by
n
map”;
J(k)[n]
is
deﬁned
so
as
to
make
the
sequence
exact.]
Thus,
assertion
(i)
follows
immediately.
To
prove
assertion
(ii),
it
suﬃces
[by
possibly
base-changing
to
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
k]
to
verify
that
two
points
x1
,
x2
∈
X(k)
that
induce
ΔX
-conjugate
sections
sx1
,
sx2
are
necessarily
equal
[cf.
also
[Tama],
Corollary
2.10].
But
this
follows
formally
from
assertion
(i),
by
considering
the
divisor
x1
−
x2
[and
the
well-known
fact
that
the
natural
morphism
X
→
J
1
considered
above
is
an
embedding].

Remark
2.3.1.
From
the
point
of
view
of
Deﬁnition
1.7,
(ii),
the
reader
may
feel
tempted
to
expect
that
[still
under
the
assumption
that
Σ
=
Primes]
D
is
principal
if
and
only
if
the
extension
DD
of
ΠX
[by
MX
]
is
trivial
[i.e.,
determines
the
zero
class
in
H
2
(ΠX
,
MX
)].
When
k
is
nonarchimedean
local,
it
is
not
diﬃcult
to
verify,
using
Proposition
2.3,
(i),
that
this
is
indeed
the
case.
On
the
other
hand,
when
k
is
ﬁnite,
although
this
condition
for
principality
is
easily
veriﬁed
to
be
necessary,
it
is
not,
however,
suﬃcient,
since
it
only
involves
the
“prime-to-p†
portion”
of
the
point
of
J(k)
determined
by
D.

of

In
fact,
the
crucial
isomorphism
Πc-ab
US
→
ΠVT
2.5,
(i),
may
also
be
constructed,
in
the
ﬁnite
ﬁeld
case,
via
the
techniques
to
be
introduced
in
§3
[although
we
shall
not
discuss
this
approach
in
detail;
cf.,
however,
the
proof
of
Theorem
3.10].
On
the
other
hand,
observe
that
unlike
the
techniques
of
§3,
the
techniques
of
§1
[in
particular,
the
proof
of
Theorem
1.16,
(iii),
via
Propositions
1.9,
1.12]
apply
to
situations
[e.g.,
the
case
of
nonarchimedean
local
ﬁelds!]
where
the
weight
ﬁltration
[cf.
§3]
does
not
admit
a
Galois-invariant
splitting.
Indeed,
the
techniques
of
§1,
essentially
only
require
that
the
Galois
cohomology
of
the
base
ﬁeld
admit
a
natural
duality
pairing.
Moreover,
even
in
the
∼
c-ab
ﬁnite
ﬁeld
case,
in
light
of
the
importance
of
this
isomorphism
Πc-ab
US

in
the
theory
of
the
present
paper,
it
is
of
interest
to
see
that
this
isomorphism
may
be
constructed
via
two
fundamentally
diﬀerent
approaches.
Finally,
although
the
techniques
of
§3
are
better
suited
to
the
reconstruction
of
the
Green’s
trivializations,
they
have
the
drawback
that
they
depend
essentially
on
the
choice
of
a
“basepoint”
x∗
∈
X(k).
Thus,
it
is
of
interest
to
know
that
this
isomorphism
may
be
constructed
[i.e.,
via
the
techniques
of
§1]
“cohomologically”
[cf.
Proposition

without
making
such
a
choice.

Remark
2.5.2.
In
the
case
of
nonarchimedean
local
ﬁelds,
it
is
natural
to
ask,
in
the
style
of
[Mzk8],
§4,
whether
or
not
various
“canonical
integral
structures”
on
the
extensions
Dx,y
[where
x,
y
∈
X(k)]
of
Gk
by
MX
are
preserved
by
arbitrary
isomorphisms
of
arithmetic
fundamental
groups.
When
x
=
y,
such
a
canonical
integral
structure
is
determined
by
the
Green’s
trivialization;
when
x
=
y,
such
a
canonical
integral
structure
is
determined
by
the
integral
structure
[in
the
usual
sense
of
scheme
theory]
on
the
canonical
sheaf
of
the
stable
model
of
the
curve
[when
the
curve
has
stable
reduction]
—
cf.
[Mzk8],
§4.
Before
proceeding,
we
note
the
following
“analogue
for
Πc-ab
US
”
of
Proposition
1.15,
(i):
Proposition
2.6.
(Automorphisms
and
Commensurators)
Let
Πc-ab
US
be
c-ab
as
in
Proposition
2.1.
For
x
∈
S,
write
Dx
[US
]
→
ΠUS
for
the
natural
inclusion.
Then:
(i)
Any
automorphism
α
of
the
proﬁnite
group
Πc-ab
US
which
(a)
is
compatible
with
the
natural
surjection
Πc-ab
US

ΠX
and
induces
the
identity
on
ΠX
;
(b)
for
each
x
∈
S,
preserves
the
image
of
MX
∼
=
Ix
[US
]
⊆
Dx
[US
]
via
the
c-ab
natural
inclusion
Dx
[US
]
→
ΠUS
is
cuspidally
inner.
(ii)
Suppose
that
X
is
Σ-separated.
Then
for
x
∈
S,
Dx
is
commensurably
terminal
in
ΠX
.
(iii)
Suppose
that
X
is
Σ-separated.
Then
the
image
of
Dx
[US
]
→
Πc-ab
US
is
c-ab
commensurably
terminal
in
ΠUS
.
Proof.
First,
we
observe
that
assertion
(ii)
follows
formally
from
the
deﬁnition
of
a
“decomposition
group”
and
“Σ-separated”.
Thus,
assertion
(i)
(respectively,
(iii))
follows
by
an
argument
which
is
entirely
similar
to
the
argument
that
was
used
to
prove
assertion
(i)
(respectively,
(iii))
of
Proposition
1.15.

Remark
2.6.1.
In
the
situation
of
Deﬁnition
2.4,
suppose
that
S,
T
are
ﬁnite,
and
that
α
arises
from
an
isomorphism
∼
ΠUS
→
ΠVT
which
is
point-theoretic
[or,
equivalently,
quasi-point-theoretic]
—
a
condition
that
is
automatically
satisﬁed
in
the
ﬁnite
ﬁeld
case
whenever
α
is
Frobenius-preserving
[cf.
ABSOLUTE
ANABELIAN
CUSPIDALIZATIONS
41
Remark
1.18.2].
Then
observe
that,
[in
light
of
our
point-theoreticity
assumption]
it
follows
from
Proposition
2.6,
(i),
that
the
resulting
induced
isomorphism
∼
c-ab
Πc-ab
US
→
ΠVT
coincides
[up
to
cuspidally
inner
automorphisms]
with
the
isomorphism
of
Theorem
2.5,
(i).
Thus,
in
light
of
Remark
2.2.2,
it
follows
formally
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
α
is
totally
(S,
T
)-locally
Green-compatible.
Corollary
2.7.
(Point-theoretic
Totally
Locally
Principally
Greencompatible
Isomorphisms)
In
the
situation
of
Theorem
1.16,
(iii),
assume
furdef
ther
that
(Σ
=
)
ΣX
=
ΣY
=
Primes,
and
that
α
is
point-theoretic
and
totally
(S,

principally
Green-compatible,
for
some
nonempty
sub∼
sets
S
⊆
X
cl
,
T
⊆
Y
cl
which
correspond
via
the
bijection
X
cl
→
Y
cl
induced
by
α.
Then
α
arises
from
a
uniquely
determined
commutative
diagram
of
schemes

in

the
vertical
arrows
are
the
proﬁnite
étale

determined
by
the
proﬁnite

ΠX
,
ΠY
.
Proof.
Corollary
2.7
follows
immediately
—
i.e.,
by
“specializing
functions
to
points”
—
from
the
deﬁnitions;
Theorem
2.5,
(ii);
Proposition
2.1,
(iii);
Remark
2.1.1;
and
[Tama],
Lemma
4.7.
Here,
we
note
that,
in
the

the
isomorphism

∼
·
(kX

2.5,

necessarily
induces
an
isomorphism
KX
→
KY×
[cf.
the
assumption
that
Σ†
=

].
Indeed,
this
is
immediate
in
the
ﬁnite
ﬁeld
case.
In
the
nonarchimedean
local
ﬁeld
case,
it
follows
via
the
arguments
applied
in
the
proof
of
[Mzk8],
Theorem
4.10:
That
is
to
say,
we
assume
for
simplicity
that
S
⊆
X(kX
);
×
then
if
f
∈
KX
,
and
x
∈
S
is
a
point
that
does
not
lie
in
the
divisor
of
zeroes
and
poles
of
f
,
then
let
us
observe
that
the
subset
×
×
⊆
f

(kX

f

kX

may
be
characterized
as
the
subset
of

[cf.
Proposition
2.1,
×
×

.
Note
that
since,
for
a
given
x1

S,
there
clearly
exist

at
x
lie
in
kX
×
f
∈
KX
[at
least
after
possibly
passing
to
an
appropriate
connected
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
X]
that
have
a
zero
or
pole
at
x1
but
not
at
some
other
x
∈
S,
this
observation
allows
us
to
recover
the
canonical
discrete
structure
[cf.
[Mzk8],
Deﬁnition
4.1,
(iii);
the
proof
of
[Mzk8],
Theorem
4.10]
on
the
decomposition
groups
in
cl
Πc-ab
US
[where
S1
⊆
X
is
an
arbitrary
ﬁnite
subset
containing
S,
which
corresponds,

42
SHINICHI

say,
to
a
subset
T1
⊆
Y
cl
that
contains
T
]
at
arbitrary
points
[i.e.,
arbitrary
“x1

of
S.
Thus,
by
applying
this
canonical
discrete
structure
[as
in
the
proof
of
[Mzk8],
Theorem
4.10],
we
may
recover
the
subset
×
×
f

kX
⊆
f

(kX

∧
×
for
arbitrary
f
∈
KX
[i.e.,
even
f
that
have
a
zero
or
pole
at
every
point
of
S]
as
the
subset
of
elements
for
which
the
restriction
to
each
point
x
of
S
either
lies
in
×
×
∧
kX
⊆
(kX

or
[when
the
element
in
question
has
a
zero
or
pole
at
x]
is
compatible
with
the
canonical
discrete
structure
at
x.
Since
this
characterization
of
the
subset
×
×
∧
⊆
f
·
(kX
)
is
manifestly
compatible
[in
light
of
the
Green-compatibility
f
·
kX
∼
c-ab
assumption
on
α]
with
the
isomorphisms
Πc-ab
US1

ΠVT1
induced
by
α,
we
thus
conclude
that
the
isomorphism

∼
∧
×
×
KX
·
(kX

→
KY×
·
(kY×

maps
the

as

Remark
2.7.1.
Suppose,
in
the
situation
of
Corollary
2.7,
that
S
=
X
cl
,
T
=
Y
cl
.
Then
unlike
the
situation
discussed
in

one
has
the
freedom
to
evaluate
functions
at
arbitrary

of
the
entire

Y
cl
,
as
opposed
to
just
certain
restricted
subsets
S
⊆

T
⊆

Thus,
instead
of
applying
[Tama],
Lemma

one
may
instead
apply
the
somewhat
easier
argument
implicit
in
[Uchi],
§3,
Lemmas
8-11
[which
is
used
to
treat

Thus,
in

of

with
the
portion
of

that

is
also
of

Moreover,
one
veriﬁes
easily
by
“induction

[where
“m”
is

that
every

It
is
not
diﬃcult
to

not

On

groups.
Then:
(i)
If
U
is
of
quasi-Belyi
type,
then
the
closed
points
of
“DLoc-type”
[in
the
sense
of
[Mzk8],
Deﬁnition
2.4]
are
pU
-adically
dense
[where
pU
is
the
residue
characteristic
of
kU
]
in
U
(kU
).
(ii)
If
U
is
of
quasi-Belyi
type,
then
β
maps
every
decomposition
group
of
a
closed
point
of
U
isomorphically
onto
a
decomposition
group
of
a
closed
point
of
V
.
(iii)
If
both
U
,
V
are
of
quasi-Belyi
type,
then
β
is
point-theoretic.
(iv)
If
U
is
of
Belyi
type,
then
so
is
V
.
Proof.
The
proof
of
assertion
(i)
is
similar
to
the
proof
of
[Mzk8],
Corollary
2.8:
That
is
to
say,
in
the
terminology
of
loc.
cit.,
it
follows
formally
from
the
fact
that
U
is
of
quasi-Belyi
type
that
the
“algebraic”
closed
points
[i.e.,
closed
points
deﬁned
over
a
number
ﬁeld,
which
are
manifestly
pU
-adically
dense
in
U
(kU
)]
of
U
are
of
“DLoc-type”
[cf.
the
proof
of
[Mzk8],
Corollary
2.8]:
Indeed,
it
suﬃces
to
consider
the
following
commutative
diagram
of
hyperbolic
curves,
whose
existence
follows
from
the
assumption
that
U
is
of
quasi-Belyi
type:
U
←−
V
⏐
⏐
−→
W

⏐
⏐
V
−→
→
U
−→
U
W
Here,
the
“hooked
arrow
→”
is
an
open
immersion;
all
of
the
“non-hooked
arrows”
except
for
V
→
W
,
V

→
W

are
ﬁnite
étale
morphisms;
V
→
W
,
V

→
W

are
dominant;
the
ﬁnite
étale
morphism
U

→
U
is
obtained
by
a
base-change
to
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
the
base
ﬁeld
kU
;
and
W
is
a
tripod
[so
W

→
W
is
a
“Belyi
map”].
Note
that
the
composite
arrow
V

→
W

→
U

→
U
may
be
thought
of
as
an
arrow
in
the
category
DLockU
(U
)
of
[Mzk8],
§2.
Observe,
moreover,
that
the
arrow
W

→
U

may
be
chosen
to
have
arbitrarily
designated
algebraic
closed
points
in
the
complement
of
its
image.
Thus,
we
conclude
that
this
diagram
exhibits
the
ABSOLUTE
ANABELIAN
CUSPIDALIZATIONS
45
[arbitrarily
designated]
algebraic
closed
points
in
the
complement
of
the
image
of
W

→
U

→
U
as
points
of
DLoc-type,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
In
light
of
assertion
(i)
[applied
to
the
various
connected
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
U
],
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii)
is
entirely
similar
to
the
proof
of
[Mzk8],
Corollary
3.2:
That
is
to
say,
by
[Mzk8],
Corollary
2.5,
it
follows
that
β
maps
decomposition
groups
of
DLoc-type
of
U
to
decomposition
groups
of
DLoc-type
of
V
.
Thus,
assertion
(ii)
follows
by
applying
[Mzk8],
Lemma
3.1
[where
the
density
statement
of
assertion
(i)
concerning
points
of
DLoc-type
allows
one
to
replace
the
“algebraicity”
condition
of
[Mzk8],
Lemma
3.1,
(iii),
by
the
condition
that
the
points
in
question
be
of
DLoctype].
Finally,
assertion
(iii)
follows
formally
from
assertion
(ii)
[and
Proposition
2.3,
(ii)].
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iv).
First,
I
claim
that
by
applying
the
isomorphism
β
[and
thinking
of
hyperbolic
orbicurves
as
being
represented
by
their
associated
étale
fundamental
groups],
one
may
transform
the
sequence
U

U1

U2

.
.
.

Um−1

Um
of
Deﬁnition

into
a
sequence
V

V2

.
.
.

Vm−1

Vm
that
also
satisﬁes
the
conditions
of
Deﬁnition
2.9,
(ii),
in
such
a
way
that
we
also
∼
obtain
compatible
isomorphisms
βj
:
ΠUj
→
ΠVj
[where
j
=
1,
.
.
.
,
m;
β1
=
β].
Indeed,
we
reason
by
induction
on
m.
If
[for
j
=
1,
.
.
.
,
m
−
1]
Uj+1
is
related
to
Uj
as
in
(a)
[of
Deﬁnition
2.9,
(ii)],
then
it
is
immediate
[by
thinking
in
terms
of
open
subgroups
of
ΠUj
,
ΠVj
]
that
one
may
construct
[from
Vj
]
a
Vj+1
related
to
Vj
as
in
(a).
If
Uj+1
is
related
to
Uj
as
in
(b)
(respectively,
(c)),
then
it
follows
from
[Mzk6],
Theorem
2.4
(respectively,
[Mzk8],
Theorem
1.3,
(iii)
[cf.
also
[Mzk8],
Theorem
2.3]),
that
one
may
construct
[from
Vj
]
a
Vj+1
related
to
Vj
as
in
(b)
(respectively,
(c)).
If
Uj+1
is
related
to
Uj
as
in
(d),
then
ΠUj+1
is
obtained
from
ΠUj
by
forming
the
quotient
of
ΠUj
by
the
closed
normal
subgroup
of
ΠUj
generated
by
some
ﬁnite
collection
of
elements
of
ΔUj
that
belong
to
the
decomposition
groups
of
points
of
Uj
in
ΔUj
.
Thus,
by
Lemma
2.11,
(v),
below,
we
conclude
that
the
quotient
ΠUj

ΠUj+1
determines
a
quotient
ΠVj

ΠVj+1
that
corresponds
to
a
partial
coarsiﬁcation
Vj
→
Vj+1
,
as
desired.
Finally,
if
Um
is
a
tripod,
the
existence
∼
of
the
isomorphism
ΠUm
→
ΠVm
implies
that
Vm
is
also
a
tripod
[cf.
[Mzk5],
Lemma
1.3.9].
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
claim.
Thus,
to
complete
the
proof
of
assertion
(iv),
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
V
is
deﬁned
over
a
number
ﬁeld.
But
observe
that
since
U
is
deﬁned
over
a
number
ﬁeld,
there
exists
a
diagram
of
hyperbolic
curves
[i.e.,
in
essence,
a
“Belyi
map”]
Um

←−
Um
→
U

−→
U
where
the
“hooked
arrow
→”
is
an
open
immersion;
the
“non-hooked
arrows”
are
ﬁnite
étale
morphisms;
and
the
ﬁnite
étale
morphism
U

→
U
is
obtained
by
46
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
a
base-change
to
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
the
base
ﬁeld
kU
.
Now
the
isomorphisms
∼
∼
ΠUm
→
ΠVm
,
ΠU
→
ΠV
allow
us
to
transform
[cf.
[Mzk8],
Theorem
2.3
and
its
proof]
this
diagram
into
a
similar
diagram
Vm
←−
Vm
→
V
−→
V
whose
existence
[since
Vm
is
also
a
tripod!]
shows
that
V
is
also
deﬁned
over
a
number
ﬁeld,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iv).

Remark
2.10.1.
Note
that
the
essential
reason
that
the
author
is
unable
to
prove
the
stronger
statement
of
Proposition

(iv),
in
the
quasi-Belyi
case
is
that,
in
the
notation
of
the

of

it
is
unclear
how
to
construct
[at
the
level
of
arithmetic
fundamental

the
dominant
morphism
V

from

That
is
to
say,
unlike
the
situation
involving
the
operations
of
Deﬁnition
2.9,
(ii),
(a),
(b),
(c),

it
is
by
no

clear
how
to
construct,
via
purely

operations,
the
quotient
of
an

arising
from

Lemma

(Finite
Subgroups
of
Fundamental
Groups
of
Hyperbolic
Orbicurves)
Let
W
be
a
hyperbolic
orbicurve
over
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
of
characteristic
zero;
ΣW
a
nonempty
set
of
prime
numbers.
Denote
the
maximal
pro-ΣW
quotient
of
the
étale
fundamental
group
of
W
by
ΔW
;
suppose
that
W
admits
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
by
a
hyperbolic
curve
that
arises
from
an
open
subgroup
of
ΔW
.
Let
A
⊆
ΔW
(respectively,
B
⊆
ΔW
)
be
the
decomposition
group
[well-deﬁned
up
to
conjugation
in
ΔW
]
of
a
closed
point
wA
(respectively,
wB
)
of

;
suppose
that
wA
=
wB
.
Then:
(i)
A,
B
are
cyclic.
(ii)
A
ΔW

B
=
{1}.
In
particular,
if
A
=

then
A
is

(iii)
The
order
of
every
ﬁnite
cyclic
closed
subgroup
C
⊆
ΔW
divides
the
order
of
W
[cf.

(iv)
Every
ﬁnite
nontrivial
closed
subgroup
C
⊆
ΔW
is
contained
in
a
decomposition
group
of
a
unique
closed
point
of
W
.
(v)
The
nontrivial
decomposition
groups
of
closed
points
of
W
may
be
characterized
as
the
maximal
ﬁnite
nontrivial
closed
subgroups
of
ΔW
.
Proof.
Assertion
(i)
follows
immediately
from
the
well-known
[and
easily
veriﬁed]
fact
that
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
a
complete
discrete
valuation
ﬁeld
with
algebraically
closed
residue
ﬁeld
of
characteristic
zero
is
cyclic.
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
Let
C
⊆
A
B
be
a
subgroup
of
prime
order
l
∈
ΣW
.
Now
consider
a
normal
open
subgroup
H
⊆
ΔW
such
that
the
covering
WH
→
W
determined
by
H
is
a
hyperbolic
curve.
Note
that
this
implies
that
ABSOLUTE

47
A
H
=
B
H
=
C
H
=
{1}
[cf.,
e.g.,
assertion
(iii),
which
will
be
proven
below
without
applying
the
present
assertion
(ii)].
Write
WH
→
WC
→
W
for
the
covering
determined
by
the
open
subgroup
C
·
H
⊆
ΔW
.
Observe
that
there
exist


,
wB
of
WC
that
lift
wA
,
wB
,
respectively,
and
whose
decomposition
closed
points
wA
groups
[well-deﬁned
up
to
conjugation
in
C
·
H]
are
equal
to
C.
Note
that
since
WH
is
a
hyperbolic
curve,
and
C
is
of
prime
order
l,
it
follows
that
the
order
of
every
closed
point
of
WC
is
equal
to
either
1
or
l.
Now
if
WC
is
aﬃne,
then
let
v
be
a
cusp
of
WC
.
If
WC
is
proper
and
admits
≥
3
points
of
order
l,
then
let
v
be
a


point
of
WC
of
order
l
such
that
v
=
wA
,
wB
.
Note
that
if
WC
is
proper
and
admits
≤
2
points
of
order
l,
then
it
follows
from
the
hyperbolicity
assumption
that
the
coarsiﬁcation
of
WC
is
a
proper
smooth
curve
of
genus
≥
1;
thus,
by
replacing
H
by
an
appropriate
open
subgroup
of
H,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
one
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
either
WC
is
aﬃne
or
WC
admits
≥
3
points
of
order
l.
Now
observe
that
WC
admits
a
ﬁnite
étale
cyclic
covering
WC
→
WC
of
degree
l
which
is
étale
over
the
compactiﬁcation
of
the
coarsiﬁcation
of
WC
,
except
over
the

,
points
in
the
compactiﬁcation
of
the
coarsiﬁcation
of
WC
corresponding
to
v,
wB


over
which
WC
is
totally
ramiﬁed.
In
particular,
it
follows
that
any
point
of
WC


lying
over
wA
(respectively,
wB
)
is
of
order
l
(respectively,
1),
thus
contradicting
the
observation
that
the
decomposition
groups
[well-deﬁned
up
to
conjugation
in


C
·
H]
of
wA
,
wB
are
equal
to
C.
This
completes
the
proof
that
A
B
=
{1}.
By
applying
this
fact
to
arbitrary
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
W
,
it
follows
formally
[cf.
Proposition
2.6,
(ii)]
that
A
is
normally
terminal
in
ΔW
,
whenever
A
=
{1}.
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
Denote
the
order
of
W
by
n.
Now
if
C
⊆
ΔW
is
a
nontrivial
ﬁnite
cyclic
closed
subgroup,
then
there
exists
a
normal
open
subgroup
def
N
⊆
ΔW
such
that
C
N
=
{1}.
In
particular,
it
follows
that
if
we
take
H
=
C
·N
[so
H
⊆
ΔW
is
an
open
subgroup],
then
the
natural
map
C
→
H
ab
is
injective.
On
the
other
hand,
if
we
denote
by
WH
→
W
the
covering
determined
by
H,
then
it
is
clear
that
the
order
of
WH
divides
n,
hence
that
H
ab
is
an
extension
of
a
torsionfree
proﬁnite
abelian
group
by
a
ﬁnite
abelian
group
annihilated
by
n.
Thus,
we
conclude
from
the
injection
C
→
H
ab
that
the
order
of
C
divides
n,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iv).
First,
let
us
observe
that
uniqueness
follows
formally
from
assertion
(ii).
Next,
let
us
verify
assertion
(iv)
under
the
further
assumption
that
C
is
solvable.
By
induction
on
the
order
of
C,
we
may
assume
that
[at
least]
one
of
the
following
conditions
is
satisﬁed:
(a)
C
is
an
extension
of
a
group
of
prime
order
by
a
nontrivial
subgroup
C1
⊆
C
which
is
contained
in
the
decomposition
group
A;
(b)
C
is
of
prime
order
l
∈
ΣW
.
If
(a)
is
satisﬁed,
then
by
replacing
W
by
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
W
determined
by
a
suitable
open
subgroup
containing
C,
we
may
assume
that
(C1
⊆)
A
⊆
C.
Thus,
if
A
=
C,
then
A
=
C1
is
normal
in
C.
But
this
implies,
by
the
normal
terminality
portion
of
assertion
(ii),
that
A
=
C,
a
contradiction.
Thus,
(a)
implies
that
C
⊆
A.
If
(b)
is
satisﬁed,
then
we
argue
as
follows:
Observe
that
by
assertion
(iii),
every
open
subgroup
H
⊆
ΔW
that
contains
C
determines
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
WH
→
W
such
that
the
order
of
WH
is
divisible
by
l.
Write
Stackl
(WH
)
for
the
set
of
closed
points
of
WH
whose
order
is
divisible
by
l.
Now
observe
that
48
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
since
the
order
of
WH
is
divisible
by
the
prime
number
l,
it
follows
that
Stackl
(WH
)
is
nonempty.
Since
the
set
Stackl
(WH
)
is
ﬁnite
and
nonempty,
we
thus
conclude
that,
if
we
allow
H
to
vary
[among
open
subgroups
H
⊆
ΔW
that
contain
C],
then
the
inverse
limit
lim
←−
Stackl
(WH
)
H
is
nonempty.
But,
unraveling
the
deﬁnitions,
this
means
precisely
that
C
contains
the
decomposition
group
D
associated
to
some
compatible
system
of
points
of
the
sets
Stackl
(WH
).
Since
D
is
of
order
divisible
by
l,
we
thus
conclude
that
D
=
C,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iv)
for
C
solvable.
On
the
other
hand,
a
well-known
theorem
from
the
theory
of
ﬁnite
groups
asserts
that
a
ﬁnite
group
in
which
every
Sylow
subgroup
is
cyclic
is
solvable
[cf.
[Scott],
p.
356].
Thus,
in
light
of
assertion
(i),
we
conclude
that
assertion
(iv)
for
C
solvable
implies
assertion
(iv)
for
C
arbitrary.
Finally,
we
observe
that
assertion
(v)
follows
formally
from
assertions
(ii),
(iv).

In
light
of
Proposition
2.10,
(iii),
(iv)
[cf.
also
Remark
2.9.1],
Corollary
2.12
follows
formally
from
Corollary
2.8.

Remark
2.12.1.
Note
that
in
the
proof
of
Proposition
2.10,
Corollary
2.12,
it
is
necessary,
in
the
quasi-Belyi
case,
to
apply
the
full
“Hom
version”
of
[Mzk4],
Theorem
A.
This
diﬀers
from
the
situation
of
[Mzk8],
Corollaries
2.8,
3.2
—
i.e.,
where
one
only
treats
hyperbolic
curves
of
strictly
Belyi
type
—
or,
indeed,
of
the
portion
of
Proposition
2.10,
Corollary
2.12,
that
concerns
curves
of
Belyi
type,
in
which
the
“isomorphism
version”
of
[Mzk4],
Theorem
A,
suﬃces
[cf.
[Mzk8],
Remark
2.8.1].
Thus,
in
the
terminology
of
[Mzk6],
Deﬁnition
3.7,
the
portion
of
Corollary
2.12
concerning
hyperbolic
curves
of
Belyi
type
admits
the
following
formal
consequence:
Corollary
2.13.
(Absoluteness
of
Curves
of
Belyi
Type)
Every
hyperbolic
curve
of
Belyi
type
over
a
nonarchimedean
local
ﬁeld
is
absolute.
Remark
2.13.1.
It
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
essential
property
that
underlies
the
absoluteness
of
Corollary
2.13
is
the
existence
of
a
Belyi
map
[since
the
curve
is
deﬁned
over
a
number
ﬁeld],
which,
in
the
context
of
the
theory
of
[Mzk8],
§2,
may
be
regarded
as
a
sort
of
endomorphism
of
the
curve.
From
this
point
of
view,
Corollary
2.13
is
reminiscent
of
[Mzk6],
Corollary
3.8,
which
states
that
the
“canonical
curves”
of
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
are
absolute.
Indeed,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
theory
of
[Mzk2],
this
canonicality
may
be
regarded
as
the
existence
of
a
sort
of
“Frobenius
endomorphism”
of
the
curve.
It
is
also
interesting
to
note
that
both
of
these
results
assert
that
every
member
of
some
countable
collection
of
nonarchimedean
hyperbolic
curves
is
absolute.
Remark
2.13.2.
In
the
context
of
Remark
2.13.1,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that,
unlike
the
canonical
curves
discussed
in
[Mzk6],
§3,
the
set
of
points
determined
by
the
hyperbolic
curves
of
strictly
Belyi
type
fails,
for
all
pairs
(g,
r)
such
that
2g
−
2
+
r
≥
3,
g
≥
1,
to
be
Zariski
dense
in
the
moduli
stack
of
hyperbolic
curves
of
type
(g,
r).
Indeed,
this
follows
immediately
from
[Mzk1],
Theorem
B.
On
the
other
hand,
it
is
not
clear
to
the
author
at
the
time
of
writing
whether
or
not
the
set
of
points
determined
by
the
hyperbolic
curves
of
Belyi
(respectively,
quasi-Belyi)
type
is
Zariski
dense
in
the
moduli
stack
of
hyperbolic
curves
of
type
(g,
r)
[when,
say,
2g
−
2
+
r
≥
3,
g
≥
2].
Note,
however,
that
when
g
=
0,
1,
[one
veriﬁes
easily
that]
every
hyperbolic
curve
of
type
(g,
r)
that
is
deﬁned
over
a
number
ﬁeld
is
automatically
of
Belyi
type.

Section

Maximal
Pro-l
Cuspidalizations
In
this
§,
we
apply
the
theory
of
the
weight
ﬁltration
[cf.
[Kane],
[Mtm]],
together
with
various
generalities
concerning
free
Lie
algebras
[cf.
the
Appendix],
to
construct,
in
the
ﬁnite
ﬁeld
case,
“maximal
cuspidally
pro-l
cuspidalizations”
[cf.
Theorem
3.10],
whose
existence
implies,
under
quite
general
conditions
[cf.
Corollary
3.11
below],
that
an
isomorphism
“α”
as
in
Theorem
1.16,
(iii),
is
always
totally
globally
Green-compatible.
In
the
following
discussion,
we
maintain
the
notation
of
§2,
and
assume
further
throughout
the
present
§3
that
we
are
in
the
ﬁnite
ﬁeld
case.
Deﬁnition
3.1.
Let
l
be
a
prime
number;
G,
H,
A
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated
pro-l
groups;
φ
:
H
→
A
a
[continuous]
homomorphism.
Suppose
further
that
A
is
abelian,
and
that
G
is
an
l-adic
Lie
group
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Serre],
Chapter
V,
§7,
§9,
for
basic
facts
concerning
l-adic
Lie
groups].
(i)
We
shall
refer
to
as
the
φ-central
ﬁltration
on
H
the
ﬁltration
deﬁned
as
follows:
def
H(1)
=
H
def
H(2)
=
Ker(φ)
def
H(m)
=

the
subgroup
topologically
generated
by
the
commutators

[H(a),
H(b)],
where
a
+
b
=
m,
∀
m
≥
3
Thus,
in
words,
this
ﬁltration
on
H
is
the
“fastest
decreasing
central
ﬁltration
among
those
central
ﬁltrations
whose
top
quotient
factors
through
φ”.
We
shall
say
that
H
is
φ-nilpotent
if
H(m)
=
{1}
for
suﬃciently
large
m.
If
H
is
φ-nilpotent
when
φ
is
taken
to
be
the
natural
surjection
H

H
ab
to
its
abelianization
H
ab
,
then
we
shall
say
that
H
is
nilpotent.
In
the
following,
for
a,
b,
n
∈
Z
such
that
1
≤
a
≤
b,
n
≥
1,
we
shall
write
def
H(a/b)
=
H(a)/H(b)
and
def
Gr(H)(n)
=

def
H(m/m
+
1)
⊆
Gr(H)
=
Gr(H)(1)
m≥n
def
Gr(H)(a/b)
=
Gr(H)(a)/Gr(H)(b)
and
append
a
subscript
Ql
(respectively,
Fl
)
to
these
objects
to
denote
the
result
of
tensoring
over
Zl
with
Ql
(respectively,
Fl
).
Thus,
Gr(H),
GrQl
(H),
GrFl
(H)
are
graded
Lie
algebras
over
Zl
,
Ql
,
Fl
,
respectively;
Gr(H)(n)
⊆
Gr(H)
is
a
[Lie
algebra-theoretic]
ideal.
Also,
if
Z
a
≥
1,
then
we
shall
write:
def
H(a/∞)
=
←
lim
−
H(a/b)
b
[where
b
ranges
over
the
integers
≥
a
+
1].

(ii)
We
shall
denote
by
Lie(G)
the
Lie
algebra
over
Ql
determined
by
G.
If
G
is
nilpotent,
then
Lie(G)
is
a
nilpotent
Lie
algebra
over
Ql
,
hence
determines
a
connected,
unipotent
linear
algebraic
group
Lin(G),
which
we
shall
refer
to
as
the
linear
algebraic
group
associated
to
G.
In
this
situation,
there
exists
[cf.,
e.g.,
Remark
3.3.2
below]
a
natural
[continuous]
homomorphism
[with
open
image]
G
→
Lin(G)(Ql
)
[from
G
to
the
l-adic
Lie
group
determined
by
the
Ql
-valued
points
of
Lin(G)]
which
is
uniquely
determined
[since
Lin(G)
is
connected
and
unipotent!]
by
the
condition
that
it
induce
the
identity
morphism
on
the
associated
Lie
algebras.
In
the
situation
of
(i),
if
Z
a
≥
1,
then
we
shall
write:
def
lim
Lie(H(a/∞))
=
←
−
Lie(H(a/b));
b
def
Lin(H(a/∞))
=
←
lim
−
Lin(H(a/b))
b
[where
b
ranges
over
the
integers
≥
a
+
1;
we
recall
that
it
is
well-known
[or
easily
veriﬁed]
that
each
H(a/b)
is
an
l-adic
Lie
group].

Assertion

is,
in
essence,
the
content
of
[Kane],
Proposition

(respectively,
Proposition
A.1,

Assertion
(iii)
follows
formally
from
assertion
(ii).
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iv).
By
Proposition
A.1,
(iii),
it
follows
that
any
free
Lie
algebra
over
Fl
with
≥
2
generators
is
center-free.
Thus,
let
M
be
the
module
determined
by
any
faithful
representation
[e.g.,
when
the
cardinality
of

is
≥
2,

of

algebra
F
over

Remark
3.3.2.
One
way
to
verify
the
existence
of
the
homomorphism
“G
→
Lin(G)(Ql
)”
of
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(ii),
is
to
think
of
G
as
a
quotient
of
a
free
pro-l
group
of
ﬁnite
even
rank
F
,
whose
associated
“GrQl
(−)”
is
a
center-free
free
Lie
algebra
[cf.
Proposition
3.3,
(i),
(ii),
in
the
case
of
r
=
1],
hence
determines
an
[inﬁnite-dimensional,
over
Ql
]
faithful
[cf.
Proposition
3.3,
(iii)]
unipotent
representation
[i.e.,
the
adjoint
representation
—
cf.
the
proof
of
Proposition
3.3,
(iv)]
of
F
.
More
precisely,
by
Proposition
3.3,
(iii),
it
follows
that
there
exists
a
unipotent
linear
representation
ρF
:
F
→
GL(V
)
on
a
ﬁnite-dimensional
Ql
-vector
space
V
such
that
Ker(ρF
)
⊆
Ker(F

G).
But
this
implies
that
F

G
factors
through
a
quotient
F

Q

G
such
that
Q
is
nilpotent
and
admits
an
injective
homomorphism
of
topological
groups
ρQ
:
Q
→
Qalg
(Ql
)
[induced
by
ρF
],
where
Qalg
is
a
connected,
unipotent
algebraic
group
over
Ql
,
such
that
ρQ
is
a
local
isomorphism,
and
Ker(ρQ
)
⊆
Ker(Q

G).
Thus,
ρQ
determines
a
structure
of
l-adic
Lie
group
on
Q
such
that
the
morphism
Lie(ρQ
)
induced
by
ρQ
on
Lie
algebras
is
an
isomorphism.
Moreover,
the
morphism
induced
by
Q

G
on
Lie
algebras
factors
through
Lie(ρQ
),
thus
determining
a
homomorphism
of
[connected,
unipotent]
algebraic
groups
Qalg
→
Lin(G)
such
that
the
resulting
composite
homomorphism
Q
→
Qalg
(Ql
)
→
Lin(G)(Ql
)
factors
[cf.
the
induced
morphisms
on
Lie
algebras,
together
with
the
fact
that
Lin(G)(Ql
)
has
no
torsion!]
though
G,
thus
yielding
a
homomorphism
G
→
Lin(G)(Ql
),
as
desired.
Next,
let
us
ﬁx
an
x∗
∈
S,
as
well
as
a
choice
of
decomposition
group
Dx∗
[US
]
⊆
ΠUS
[i.e.,
among
the
various
ΠUS
-conjugates
of
this

associated
to
x∗
.
[Thus,
Dx∗
[US

determines
a

US
(Center-freeness

Proof.
Since

center-free
[cf.
Proposition
1.8,
(iii)],
and
the
natural
morphism
ΔLie
US

ΔUS0

it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
the
centralizer
in

LinUS
(1/∞)
of
the

of

is
trivial.
But
the
image
of
ΔUS
in
LinUS

contains
the
image
of
ΔUS
in

In
particular,
it
follows
that
the

in

lies

is
the

of

lie
over

On
the
other
hand,
it
follows
from
the
deﬁnition
of
“CnwS∗
(b

that
CnwS∗
(b

is
generated
by

with
the
S
property
that
at

appearing
in

is
[in

or
one
of
the

where

Moreover,
since,
by
taking

be
suﬃciently

one
may
arrange

it
thus
follows
that

This

the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Next,
let
us
observe
that

clearly
factors
through

it
thus
suﬃces
to

[by

that

This

we
conclude
that
the

on

is
determined
up
to
composition
with
automorphisms

that
commute
with

of
DX


and
[cf.
condition
(c)]
induce
the
identity
on
the
quotient
LinUS


Now
let
α
be
an
automorphism
of
LinUS

(1/∞)
that
commutes
with
the
action
of
DX


and
induces
the

Then
α
commutes
with
some
open
subgroup
of
Gk
⊆
Dx∗
[US

⊆
DX
,
so
α
induces
an
automorphism
of
LieUS

(1/∞)
that
is
compatible
with
the
splittings
of
Propo(l)
sition
3.4,

Since
Gr(ΔU

)
is
generated
by
its
elements
“of

≤

[cf.
S
Proposition
3.3,

we
thus
conclude
that
α
induces
the
identity
automorphism
of



(1/∞),
hence
that
α
itself
is
the
identity
automorphism.
This
completes
S
the
proof
of
the
claim.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
by
condition
(c)
[cf.
also
Proposition
3.3,

the
Δ
action
of
DX

/X
on
LinU


(1/∞)
is
unipotent,
relative
to
the
ﬁltration
of
condition
S
(b).
Thus,
it
follows
[from
the
deﬁnition
of
“Lie(−)”]
that
the
induced
action
of
Δ
DX

on

LieU


(1/∞).
Moreover,
to
complete
the
proof
of
Proposition

it
suﬃces
S
to
show
that
this
Lie

is
the

In
fact,
since

with

(1/∞),
it
follows,
by
considering
the

that

on

[cf.

Proposition

this

First,
we
consider
assertions

(ii).
Observe
that,
for
Z

the

[where
X

ranges
over
the

coverings
of
X;
S

is
the
set
of
closed
points
of

that
lie
over

Since
Newtor
S

(b

=

whenever
b
is
even,
we
may
assume
for
the
remainder
of
the
proof
of
assertions
(i),
(ii)
that
b
is
odd.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
by
Proposition
3.4,
(i),
the
zeroth
cohomology
module

(Π≤b

NewS

ﬁnite.
This
ﬁniteness
implies
that

(Π≤b

NewS

always
admits
a

In

[where

are

described

we
thus
conclude
that
in
order
to
show
TOR≤b+1
that
the
two

by
conjugation
by
an
element
of

it
suﬃces
to

tor
Note
that
Π≤b
US
[csp]
acts
trivially
on
NewS

(b
+
1/b
+
2)).
Now
I
claim
that:
Each
ηS

arises
from
a
unique
class
[which,
by
abuse
of
notation,
we
shall
also
denote
by
ηS

]
in
H
1
(ΠX
,
Newtor
S

(b
+
1/b
+
2)).
Indeed,
if
b
=
1,
this
claim
follows
from
the
fact
that
Π≤b
US
[csp]
=
{1}
[cf.
the
discussion
preceding
Proposition
3.7],
so
assume
that
b
≥
2,
and
that
we
are
in
the
situation
of
assertion
(ii).
Now
observe
that
since
S
=
S∗
is
of
cardinality
one,
it
follows
ABSOLUTE

≤b++
that
Π≤b

is
topologically
generated
by
the

ΠUS

(re≤b++

spectively,
ΠUS

conjugates
of
Ix∗
(respectively,
Ix∗

Note,
moreover,
that
it
LIE≤b+
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
every
element
of
Ker(ΠTOR≤b+1

ΠU
)
US
S
≤b
≤b++
.
In
particular,
it
follows
that
the
images
of
ΠUS
[csp]
via
the
commutes
with
Ix∗
≤b
two
inclusions
ΠUS
→
ΠTOR≤b+1
under
consideration
necessarily
coincide.
But
this
US
implies
that
each
ηS

arises
from
a
unique
class
in
H
1
(ΠX
,
Newtor
S

(b
+
1/b

thus
completing
the
proof
of
the
claim.
Next,
[returning
to
the
general
situation
involving
both
assertions
(i)
and
(ii)]
let
X

→
X

be
a
morphism
of
(S,
∅,
Σ)-admissible
coverings
of

Write
US
⊆


for
the
open
subscheme
determined
by
the
complement
of
the
set
S

of
closed
points
of
X

that
lie
over
points
of
S.
Also,
let
us
assume
that
the
open
subgroup
ΔX

⊆
ΔX

arises
from
some
open
subgroup
H

⊆
Δab
X

that
is
preserved
by
the
action
of
ΠX
.
Thus,
it
def
follows
that
the
covering
Xk
→
Xk
is
abelian;
write
Gal(X

subgroup
of
the
abelian
group
Gal(X

that
arises
as
the
image
of

by

Thus,
R
(respectively,
R

Rc

is
a
commutative
ring
with
unity
whose
underlying
R

(respectively,

moreover,

admit
a

Next,
let

In

determines

Note

(C)
Suppose
that
H

=
ln

Δab
X

⊆
ΔX

,
where
n
is
a
positive
integer.
For
M
a
ﬁnitely
generated
Zl

[which
we
regard
as
equipped
with
the
trivial
ΔX

write:
def

(l)
(l)
Then
the
“trace
map”
TrH
:
HX


HX

—
i.e.,
the
map
induced
by
the
morphism
of
coeﬃcients
M
[Gal(X


M
that
maps
each

—
factors
through
the
endomorphism

of


given
by
multiplication
by
ln
[cf.
Remark
3.9.2
below].
[Indeed,
to
verify
(C),
we
recall
that
this
trace
map
TrH
is
well-known
to
be
dual
[via
Poincaré
duality
—
cf.,
e.g.,
[FK],
pp.

to
the
pull-back

∼
we
thus
conclude
that,

[arising
from

cf.,
e.g.,

the
trace

corresponds
to
the
natural

hence,

This
completes
the
proof

Then
we
wish
to
apply
the

the

by
taking

in
this

be
various
subcoverings

Now
let
us
compute
the

of
ΠX
via
the
Leray
spectral
sequence
associated
to
the
surjection

Suppose
that



that

Then
by
applying
(A)
to
the
covering
“X

(respectively,


“X

we
conclude
that

acts
trivially
on

(respectively,
NewS

Also,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
we
have
a

Now,
by

Thus,
by

Indeed,
note

be

we
may
conclude
that
ηS

as
desired.
That
is
to
say:
TOR≤b+1
This
completes
the
proof
that
the

In

the
proof

complete.
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
First,
let
us
observe
that
when
b

assertion
(iii)

immediately
from
[the
“pro-l
version”
of
the
argument
applied
to

Proposition

(i)
[cf.
the
discussion
preceding
Proposition
3.7].
Thus,
in
the
remainder
of
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii),
we
assume
that
b
≥
2.
Note
that
since
the
≤b+1

Π≤b
,
elements
of
Ker(Π≤b+1
US
US
)
manifestly
commute
with
the
elements
of
Ix∗
it
follows
from
conditions
(a),
(b),
the
fact
that
b
≥
2,
and
the
assumption
that
[csp]
[cf.
the
proof
S
=
S∗
is
of
cardinality
one
that
β
induces
the
identity
on
Π≤b+1
US
of
assertion
(ii)
above].
Thus,
to
complete
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii),
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
the
compatible
system

Note
that

and
NewS

(b

+
2)
is
of
“weight
b
+
1
≥
3”
[cf.
Proposition
3.4,
(i)],
it
follows
immediately
from
the
Leray
spectral
sequence
for
ΠX

Gk
that
we
have
a
natural
isomorphism
∼

(iv).
In
light
of
the
deﬁnition
of
ΠTOR≤b+1
US
ﬁces
to
show
that
any
compatible
system
of

[relative
to
the
diagonal
action

classes
κS

S

are
as
described
in
the

of
assertions
(i),
(ii)]
lies
in
the
image
of
Ix∗
[US
]
⊗
(Ql
/Zl
)
if
b
=
1
and
vanishes
if
b
≥
2.
[Here,
we
note
that
since
Newtor
S

(b
+
1/b
+
2)
=
0
when
b
is
even,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
b
is
odd.]
To
do
this,
let
X

,
X

,
S

,
S

be
as
in
(A),
(B).
Now
we
would
like
to
apply
the
theory
of
the
Appendix
[cf.,
especially,
Theorem
A.5]
to
the
present
situation.
To
do
this,
it
is
necessary
to
specify
the
data
“(i),
(ii),
(iii),
(vi),
(vii),
(viii),
(ix),
(x),
(xi),
(xii)”
[cf.
the
discussion
of
the
Appendix]
to
which
this
theory
is
to
be
applied.
We
take
the
“d”
of
Theorem
A.5
to
be
such
that
2d
=
b
+
1
[so
the
fact
that
b
is
odd
implies
that
d
≥
2
whenever
b
≥
2]
and
the
prime
number
“l”
of
“(i)”
to
be
the
prime
number
l
of
the
present
discussion.
We
take
the
proﬁnite
group
“Δ”
of
“(ii)”
to
be
the
quotient
of
the
group
ΔX
by
the
kernel
of
the
quotient
ab
(ΔX
⊇)
ΔX


Δab
X


ΔX

⊗
Zl
;
this
group
“Δ”
surjects
onto
ΔX
/ΔX

,
which
we
take
to
be
the
quotient
group
“G”
of
“(ii)”,
with
kernel
Δab
X

⊗
Zl
,
which
we
take
to
be
the
subgroup
“V
”
of
“(ii)”.
Here,
we
recall
that
the
condition
of
“(ii),
(c)”
concerning
the
regular
representation
follows
immediately
from
[Milne],
p.
187,
Corollary
2.8
[cf.
also
[Milne],
p.
187,
Remark
2.9],
in
light
of
our
assumption
that
X
is
proper
hyperbolic,
hence
of
genus
≥
2.
We
take
the
proﬁnite
group
“Γ”
of
“(ix)”
to
be
the
image
Gk
⊆
Gk
of
ΠX

in
Gk
[so
“Γ”
acts
naturally
on
“Δ”,
“G”,
“H”].
Thus,
“ΔΓ
”
may
be
thought
of
as
a
quotient
of
ΠX
×Gk
Gk
,
hence
also
as
a
quotient
of
DX
×Gk
Gk
.
Note
that
by
consideration
of
“weights”,
it
follows
that
Gk
(Newtor
S

(b
+
1/b
+
2))
is
ﬁnite,
hence
annihilated
by
some
ﬁnite
power
of
l,
which
we
take
to
be
the
number
“N
”
of
“(iii)”.
We
take
the
covering
X

→
X

of
(A),
(B)
to
be
any
(S,
∅,
Σ)admissible
covering
such
that
the
resulting
covering
Xk
→
Xk
is
the
covering
determined
by
the
resulting
subgroup
“ln
·
V
⊆
Δ”
[cf.
the
statement
of
Theorem
A.5],
so
“J”
may
be
identiﬁed
with
Gal(X

/X

).
Next,
we
take
the
“G-torsor
EG
”
of
“(vi)”
to
be
S

and
the
“H-torsor
EH
”
of
“(vii)”
to
be
S

;
thus,
the
natural
surjection
S


S

determines
a
surjection
“EH

EG
”
as
in
“(viii)”.
Note
that
S

(respectively,
S

)
may
be
thought
of
as
a
ΔUS
-orbit
(respectively,
ΔUS

orbit)
[via
the
action
by
conjugation]
of
the
conjugacy
class
of
subgroups
of
ΔUS
determined
by
Ix∗
[US
]
⊆
ΔUS
.
In
particular,
it
follows
that
the
particular
member
of
this
conjugacy
class
constituted
by
the
subgroup
Ix∗
[US
]
⊆
ΔUS
determines
a
particular
element
eH
∈
EH
(respectively,
eG
∈
EG
)
as
in
“(xi)”.
Moreover,
the
diagonal
action
of
DX
—
hence
also
of
DX
×Gk
Gk
⊆
DX
—
on
ΔUS
determines
an
action
of
DX
×Gk
Gk
⊆
DX
on
EH
,
EG
that
ﬁxes
eH
,
eG
,
and
[as
is
easily
veriﬁed]

factors
through
the
quotient
“ΔΓ
”
of
DX
×Gk
Gk

ΠX
×Gk
Gk
;
in
particular,
we
obtain
continuous
actions
of
“ΔΓ
”
on
“EG
”,
“EH
”
as
in
“(x)”.
Finally,
we
take
(l)
the
“Γ-module
Λ”
of
“(xii)”
to
be
the
d-th
tensor
power
of
MX
⊗
(Ql
/Zl
).
This
completes
the
speciﬁcation
of
the
data
necessary
to
apply
Theorem
A.5.
Thus,
by
applying
Theorem
A.5
to
the
composite
of
the
second
and
third
surjections
in
the
factorization
of
(A),
we
conclude
that
since
κS

is
DX
-invariant,
it
follows
that
κS

∈
Newtor
S

(b
+
1/b
+
2)
Gk

=
0
when
b
≥
2
and
to
maps
to
an
element
[i.e.,
κS

]
of
N
·
Newtor
S

(b
+
1/b
+

an
element
[i.e.,
κS

]
in
the
image
of
Ix∗
[US
]
⊗
(Ql
/Zl
)
when
b
=
1.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iv).
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(v).
It
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
the
various
quotients
in
question
are
cuspidally
pro-l.
That
these
quotients
are
the
maximal
cuspidally
pro-l
quotients
follows
from
the
construction
of
Δ≤∞
US
and
the
(l)
(l)
easily
veriﬁed
fact
that
each
ΔU

injects
into
Lin(ΔU

(1/∞))(Ql
).
Finally,
the
S
S
asserted
slimness
follows
from
the
fact
that
the
proﬁnite
groups
in
question
may
be
written
as
inverse
limits
of
proﬁnite
groups
that
admit
normal
open
subgroups

which
are

by

as
well
as
the

of
these

are
slim].

Remark
3.9.1.
Proposition
3.9,
(iii),
may
be
regarded
as
a
“higher
order,
pro-l
analogue”
of
Proposition
2.6,
(i).
Remark
3.9.2.
It
is
important
to
note
that
if
one
omits
[as
was,
mistakenly,
done
in
an
earlier
version
of
this
paper]
the
hypothesis
that
S0
=
∅,
then
it
no
longer
holds
that
the
image
of
the
trace
map
“TrH
:
HX

→
HX

”
[appearing
in
the
proof
of
Proposition
3.9,
(i),
(ii)]
lies
in
ln
·
HX

.
Indeed,
this
phenomenon
may
be
understood
by
considering
the
trace
map
on
ﬁrst
étale
cohomology
modules
with
Zl
-coeﬃcients
associated
to
the
ln
-th
power
map
Gm
→
Gm
on
the
multiplicative
group
Gm
over
k
—
a
map
which,
as
an
easy
computation
reveals,
is
surjective.
We
are
now
ready
to
prove
the
main
technical
result
of
the
present
§3:
Theorem
3.10.

Proof.
First,
let
us
consider
the
isomorphism
[i.e.,
more
precisely:
a
speciﬁc
member
of
the
cuspidally

equivalence
class
of

∼
c-ab
arising
from
the
isomorphism
Πc-ab
UX×X
→
ΠUY
×Y
of
Theorem
1.16,
(iii).
Recall
that
since
α
is
Frobenius-preserving,
it
is
quasi-point-theoretic
[cf.
Remark
1.18.2],
and
that
αc-ab,l
is
compatible
with
the
images
of
DX
,
DY
,
which
we
denote
by
(l)
(l)
DX
,
DY
.
Thus,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
our
choices
of
decomposition
groups
Dx∗
[US
]
⊆
ΠUS
,
Dy∗
[VT
]
⊆
ΠVT
,
as
well
as
our
choices
of
c-ab,l
splittings
GkX

have
images
in
Πc-ab,l
UX×X
,
ΠUY

that
⊆
Πc-ab,l
correspond
via
αc-ab,l
.
In
particular,
it
follows
that
αc-ab,l
maps
Πc-ab,l
US
UX×X
isomorphically
onto
Πc-ab,l
⊆
Πc-ab,l
VT
UY
×Y
.
In
the
following
argument,
let
us
identify
the
“LinUS
(1/∞)”,
“LinX
(1/∞)”
portions
of
ΔLie
US
with
the
[completions,
relative
to
the
natural

of
the]
corresponding

objects
“GrQl
(−)(1/∞)”
via
the
Galois
invariant
splittings
of
Proposition
3.4,
(ii),
and
similarly
for
VT
.
Then,
in
light
of
our
assumption
that
α
is
Frobenius-preserving,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
naturality
of
our
constructions
[cf.,
especially,
Proposition
3.4,
(iii)]
that
α
induces,
for
each

;
∼

are,
moreover,
compatible
[with
respect
to
the
natural
projections
to

,
ΠY
]
”
with
the
isomorphism
α.
Moreover,
it
follows
from
the
construction
of
“ΠLIE≤b

that
the
latter
displayed
isomorphism
maps
DxLIE≤b
⊆
ΠLIE≤b
bijectively
onto
US

LIE≤b
∼
Dy∗

and
that
the
resulting
isomorphism
Dx∗

an

∼

which
is
compatible
[again

with
the
respective

Next,
let
us
observe
that
since
the
isomorphism

an

with

it

that

In
fact,
since

is
odd,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
the

“NewQ

vanish,
hence
[cf.
Deﬁnition
3.5,

that
we

an

[cf.

that

Moreover,
by

concerning

of

with

[cf.
also
the

and
the

it
follows
[cf.

that
the
conditions
(a),

of

are

that

≤b
Now
I
claim
that
the
isomorphism
αLIE≤b
maps
Π≤b
US
bijectively
onto
ΠVT
,
thus
inducing
a
compatible
inverse
system
[parametrized
by
b]
of
isomorphisms
∼
≤b
α≤b
:
Π≤b
US
→
ΠVT

that
are
compatible
[with
respect
to
the
natural
projections
Π≤b
US

ΠX
,
ΠVT

ΠY
]
with
α.
To
verify
this
claim,
we
apply
induction
on
b.
The
case
b
=
1
is
vacuous;
the
case
b
=
2
follows
from
what
we
have
already
shown
concerning
the
compatibility
of
αLIE≤2
with
αc-ab,l
.
Thus,
we
assume
that
b
≥
2,
and
that
the
claim
has
been
veriﬁed
for
“b”
that
are
≤
the
b
under
consideration.
Now
observe
that
by
Propositions
3.7,
(iii);
3.9,
(ii),
it
follows
that
the
isomorphism
LIE≤b+1
∼
ΠU
→
ΠVLIE≤b+1
S
T
maps
Π≤b+1
bijectively
onto
a
Ker(ΠLIE≤b+1

ΠVLIE≤b+
)-conjugate
of
Π≤b+1
.
US
VT
VT
T
LIE≤b+1
In
particular,
by
conjugating
by
an
appropriate
element
γ
∈
Ker(ΠVT

LIE≤b+
ΠVT
),
we
obtain
an
isomorphism
∼
βb+1
:
Π≤b+1
→
Π≤b+1
US
VT
that
is
compatible
with
α≤b
and,
moreover,
[since
γ
commutes
with
Iy≤b+1
]
maps
∗
≤b+1
≤b+1
bijectively
onto
Iy∗
.
Note
that
by
Propositions
3.7,
(i);
3.9,
(iii),
it
follows
Ix∗

77
that
the
choice
of
γ
is
unique,
modulo

In
particular,
the
TOR≤b+1
TOR≤b+1
image
δ
∈
ΠVT
of
γ
in
ΠVT
is
uniquely
determined.
(l)
On
the
other
hand,
since
αLIE
is
compatible
with
the
diagonal
actions
of
DX
,
(l)
LIE
DY
on
ΠLIE
US
,
ΠVT
,
it
follows
immediately,
by
“transport
of
structure”,
that
δ
is
(l)
ﬁxed
by
the
diagonal
action
of
DY
.
But,
by
Proposition
3.9,
(iv),
this
implies
that
δ
=
0.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
claim.
∼
≤∞
Thus,
we
obtain
an
isomorphism
α∞
:
Π≤∞
US
→
ΠVT
as
in
the
statement
of
≤∞
Theorem
3.10.
Next,
let
us
recall
that
Δ≤∞
US
,
ΔVT
are
slim
[cf.
Proposition
3.9,
(v)].
Thus,
since
this
isomorphism
α∞
is
compatible
with
the
diagonal
actions
of
∼
(l)
(l)
≤∞
DX
,
DY
,
we
may
apply
the
isomorphism
Aut(Δ≤∞
US
)
→
Aut(ΔVT
)
induced
by
α∞
to
obtain
—
i.e.,
by
pulling
back
the
extension
≤∞
≤∞

→
Δ≤∞
US
→
Aut(ΔUS
)
→
Out(ΔUS

[cf.

via

(DX

(l)

arising
from
the

—
an
isomorphism
α∞
:
∼
≤∞
Π≤∞
UX×X
→
ΠUY
×Y
as
in
the
statement
of
Theorem
3.10.
Here,
we
note
that
the
“cuspidally
inner
indeterminacy”
of
α∞
,
α×
∞
that
is
referred
to
in
the
statement
of
Theorem
3.10
arises
from
the
“cuspidally
inner
indeterminacy”
in
the
choice
of
corresponding
decomposition
groups
Dx∗
[US
],
Dy∗
[VT
]
[more
precisely:
the

Finally,
we
obof
these
groups
in
Π≤∞
US
,
ΠVT
,
as
opposed
to
just
in
ΠUS
,
ΠVT
serve
that
the
asserted
uniqueness
follows
immediately
by
considering
eigenspaces
relative
to
the
Frobenius
actions
[cf.
Proposition
3.4,

together
with
the
construction
of

Remark
3.10.1.
The
argument
of
the
proof
of
Theorem
3.10
involving
Proposition
3.9,
(iv),
may
be
regarded
as
a
sort
of
“higher

of
the
argument
applied
in
the
proof
of
Theorem
1.16,
(iii),
involving
Lemma
1.11;
Proposition
1.12,
(v).
Remark
3.10.2.
At
ﬁrst
glance,
it
may
appear
that
the
portion
of
Theorem
3.10
concerning
α×
∞
may
only
be
concluded
when
X(kX
),
Y
(kY
)
are
nonempty.
In

†
†
however,
since
(Π≤∞
UX×X
)
,
(ΠUY

)
are
slim
[cf.
Proposition
3.9,
(v)],
it
follows
that
the
portion
of
Theorem
3.10
concerning
α×
∞
may
be
concluded
even
without
assuming
that
X(kX
),
Y
(kY
)
are
nonempty,
by
applying
Theorem
3.10
after
passing
to
corresponding
[via
α]
ﬁnite
extensions
of
kX
,
kY
[cf.
Remark
1.10.1].
Remark
3.10.3.
It
seems
reasonable
to
expect
that,
when,
say,
Σ
=
{l},
the
techniques
applied
in
the
proof
of
Theorem
3.10,
together
with
the
theory
of
[Mtm],
78
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
should
allow
one
to
reconstruct
the
[geometrically
pro-Σ]
étale
fundamental
groups
of
the
various
conﬁguration
spaces
[i.e.,
ﬁnite
products
of
copies
of
X
over
kX
,
with
the
various
diagonals
removed]
“group-theoretically”
from
ΠX
[under,
say,
an
appropriate
hypothesis
of
“Frobenius-preservation”
as
in
Theorem
3.10].
This
topic,
however,
lies
beyond
the
scope
of
the
present
paper.
Remark
3.10.4.
If
the
“cuspidalization
of
conﬁguration
spaces”
[cf.
Remark
3.10.3]
can
be
achieved,
then
it
seems
likely
that
by
applying
an
appropriate
“specialization”
operation,
it
should
be
possible
to
generalize
Theorem
3.10
to
the
case
where
S,
T
are
subsets
of
arbitrary
ﬁnite
cardinality.
Remark
3.10.5.
One
essential
portion
of
the
proof
of
Theorem
3.10
is
the
Galois
invariant
splitting
of
Proposition
3.4,
(ii).
Although
it
does
not
appear
likely
that
such
a
splitting
exists
in
the
case
of
a
nonarchimedean
local
base
ﬁeld
[cf.,
e.g.,
the
theory
of
[Mzk4]],
it
would
be
interesting
to
investigate
the
extent
to
which
a
result
such
as
Theorem
3.10
may
be
generalized
to
the
nonarchimedean
local
case,
perhaps
by
making
use
of
some
sort
of
splitting
such
as
the
Hodge-Tate
decomposition,
or
a
splitting
that
arises
via
crystalline
methods.
In
the
context
of
absolute
anabelian
geometry
over
nonarchimedean
local
ﬁelds,
however,
such
p-adic
Hodge-theoretic
splittings
might
not
be
available,
since
the
isomorphism
class
of
the
Galois
module
“Cp
”
is
not
preserved
by
arbitrary
automorphisms
of
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
a
nonarchimedean
local
ﬁeld
[cf.
the
theory
of
[Mzk3]].
The
development
of
the
theory
underlying
Theorem
3.10
was
motivated
by
the
following
important
consequence:
Corollary
3.11.
(Total
Global
Green-compatibility)
In
the
situation
of
Theorem
1.16,
(iii)
[in
the
ﬁnite
ﬁeld
case],
suppose
further
that
Σ†
=
Primes†
,
and
that
X,
Y
are
Σ-separated
[which
implies
that
α
is
Frobenius-preserving
and
point-theoretic
—
cf.
Remarks
1.18.1,
1.18.2].
Then
the
isomorphism
α
is
totally
globally
Green-compatible.
Proof.
Indeed,
we
may
apply
Theorem
3.10
to
the
isomorphism
α
of
Theorem
1.16,
(iii),
and
arbitrary
choices
of
sets
of
cardinality
one
S
=
{x∗
},
T
=
{y∗
}
that
correspond
via
α.
Let
l
∈
Σ†
.
Then
let
us
observe
that
the
quotient
ΠUS

Π≤∞
US
satisﬁes
the
following
property:
If
ΠUS

Q
is
a
ﬁnite
quotient
of
ΠUS
such
that
for
some
quotient
Q

Q
whose
kernel
has
order
a
power
of
l,
ΠUS

Q
factors
through
ΠUS

≤∞
Π≤∞
US
,
then
ΠUS

Q
also
factors
through
ΠUS

ΠUS
.
A
similar
statement
holds
for
the
quotient
ΠVT

Π≤∞
VT
.
In
light
of
this
observation,
†
†
together
with
our
assumption
that
Σ
=
Primes
[which
implies
that
α
is
Frobeniuspreserving],
it
follows
that

be
applied
to
the

∼

α∞

Π≤∞
US

of
Theorem

conclude
that

maps
the
set
of
decomposition
subgroups
of
the

bijectively
onto
the
set
of

deﬁnitions,

lifting
of

associated

the

Since

and
the
points

arbitrary
points
that

this
shows
that

Green-compatible.
That

follows
by
applying

the

Appendix:
Free
Lie
Algebras
In
this
present
Appendix,
we
discuss
various
elementary
facts
concerning
free
Lie
algebras
that
are
necessary
in
§3.
In
particular,
we
develop
a
sort
of
“higher
order
analogue”
of
the
theory
developed
in
Lemma
1.11.
Proposition
A.1.
(Free
Lie
Algebras)
Let
R
be
a
commutative
ring
with
unity;
V
a
ﬁnitely
generated
free
R-module.
Write
LieR
(V
)
for
the
free
Lie
algebra
over
R
associated
to
V
;
for
Z
b
≥
1,
denote
by
LiebR
(V
)
⊆
LieR
(V
)
the
R-submodule
generated
by
the
“alternants
of
degree
b”
[cf.
[Bour],
Chapter
II,
§2.6].
Also,
we
shall
denote
by
UR
(V
)
the
enveloping
algebra
of
LieR
(V
).
[Thus,
we
have
a
natural
inclusion
LieR
(V
)
→
UR
(V
).]
Then:
(i)
Each
LiebR
(V
)
is
a
ﬁnitely
generated
free
R-module.
Moreover,
there
is
∼
a
natural
isomorphism
V
→
Lie1R
(V
).
(ii)
Let
v
∈
V
be
a
nonzero
element
such
that
the
quotient
module
V
/R
·
v
is
free.
Then
the
centralizer
of
v
in
UR
(V
)
is
equal
to
the
R-submodule
of
UR
(V
)
generated
by
the
nonnegative
powers
of
v.
In
particular,
if
R
is
a
ﬁeld
of
characteristic
zero,
then
the
centralizer
of
v
in
LieR
(V
)
is
equal
to
R
·
v.
(iii)
Suppose
that
the
rank
of
V
over
R
is
≥
2.
Then
the
Lie
algebra
LieR
(V
)
is
center-free.
In
particular,
the
adjoint
representation
of
LieR
(V
)
is
faithful.
(iv)
Let
R
be
an
R-algebra
which
is
ﬁnitely
generated
and
free
as
an
Rmodule.
Let
φ
:
R

R
be
a
surjection
of
R-algebras;
suppose
that
V
=
V

⊗R
,φ
R,
for
some
ﬁnitely
generated
free
R
-module
V

[so
we
obtain
a
natural
surjection
V


V
compatible
with
φ].
Then
the
natural
surjection
V


V
induces
a
surjection
of
R-modules
LiebR
(V

)

LiebR
(V
)
that
factors
as
a
composite
of
natural
surjections
as
follows:
LiebR
(V

)

LiebR
(V

)

LiebR
(V
)
Here,
the
ﬁrst
arrow
of
this
factorization
is
the
arrow
naturally
induced
by
observing
that
every
Lie
algebra
over
R
naturally
determines
a
Lie
algebra
over
R;
the
second
arrow
of
this
factorization
is
the
arrow
functorially
induced
by
the
natural
φcompatible
surjection
V


V
.
Finally,
this
second
arrow
induces
an
isomorphism
∼
LiebR
(V

)
⊗R
,φ
R
→
LiebR
(V
).
Proof.
Assertion
(i)
follows
immediately
from
[Bour],
Chapter
II,
§2.11,
Theorem
1,
Corollary.
Assertion
(ii)
follows
from
the
well-known
structure
of
the
enveloping
algebra
UR
(V
)
[i.e.,
the
natural
isomorphism
of
UR
(V
)
with
the
free
associative
algebra
determined
by
V
over
R;
the
fact
that
when
R
is
a
ﬁeld
of
characteristic
zero,
the
image

Next,
let
us
suppose
that
we
have
been
given
data
as
follows:
(i)
a
prime
number
l;
(ii)
a
proﬁnite
group
Δ
that
admits
an
normal
open
subgroup
V
⊆
Δ
such
that
the
following
conditions
are
satisﬁed:
(a)
V
is
abelian
[so
we
shall
regard
V
as
a
module];
(b)
the
topological
module
V
is
a
ﬁnitely
generated
def
free
R-module,
where
we
write
R
=
Zl
;
(c)
the
resulting
action
of
the
def
def
ﬁnite
group
G
=
Δ/V
on
V
determines
a
G-module
VQl
=
V
⊗
Ql
that
contains
the
regular
representation
of
G;
(iii)
a
positive
power
N
of
l;
(iv)
a
collection
of
[not
necessarily
distinct!]
elements
g1
,
.
.
.
,
gd
∈
G
[where
d
≥
1
is
an
integer]
of
G
at
least
one
of
which
is
not
equal
to
the
identity
element.
Write
def
ζ
=
d

(1
−
gi
)
∈
R[G]
i=1
[where
R[G]
is
the
group
ring
of
G
with
coeﬃcients
in
R].
Then
we
have
the
following
result:
Lemma
A.2.
(Nontriviality
of
a
Certain
Operator)
There
exists
an
integer
n
≥
1
such
that
the
order
|Jζ
|
of
the
image
Jζ
⊆
J
def
of
the
action
of
ζ
on
[the
ﬁnite
group]
J
=
V
⊗
(Z/ln
Z)
is
divisible
by
N
.
Proof.
Indeed,
since
the
G-module
VQl
contains
the
regular
representation
[cf.
condition
(ii),
(c)],
it
follows
that
the
image
of
the
action
of
ζ
on
VQl
is
a
nonzero
Ql
-vector
space,
hence
that
the
image
of
the
action
of
ζ
on
the
ﬁnitely
generated
free
R-module
V
[cf.
condition
(ii),
(b)]
contains
a
rank
one
free
R-module.
Now
Lemma
A.2
follows
immediately.

def
Next,
let
Jζ
⊆
J
be
as
in
Lemma
A.2;
write
H
=
Δ/(ln
·
V
)
[so
J
⊆
H,
H/J
=
G].
Also,
let
us
assume
that
we
have
been
given
data
as
follows:
82
SHINICHI

(v)
a
collection
of
elements
h1
,
.
.
.
,
hd
∈
H
that
lift
g1
,
.
.
.
,
gd
∈
G;
(vi)
a
G-torsor
EG
[whose
G-action
will
be
written
as
an
action
from
the
left];
(vii)
an
H-torsor
EH
[whose
H-action
will
be
written
as
an
action
from
the

(viii)
a
surjection

:
EH

EG
that
is
compatible
with
the
natural
surjection
H

G;
(ix)
a
continuous
action
of
a
proﬁnite
group
Γ
on
Δ
that
preserves
the
subdef
group
V
⊆
Δ,
hence
determines
a
proﬁnite
group
ΔΓ
=
Δ

Γ
that
acts
continuously
on
G,
H
[in
such
a
way
that
the
restriction
of
this
action
to
Δ
⊆
ΔΓ
is
the
action
of
Δ
on
G,
H
by
conjugation];
(x)
continuous
actions
of
ΔΓ
on
EG
,
EH
[which
will
be
denoted
via
superscripts]
that
are
compatible
with
the
continuous
actions
of
ΔΓ
on
G,
H,
as
well
as
with
the
surjection

and,
moreover,
induce
the
trivial
action
of
Γ
⊆
ΔΓ
on
EG
[hence
also
on
G];
(xi)
an
element
[i.e.,
“basepoint”]
eH
∈
EH
,
whose
image
via

we
denote
by
eG
∈
EG
,
such
that
eH
,
eG
are
ﬁxed
by
the
action
of
ΔΓ
on
EH
,
EG
.
Next,
let
us
write
def
RJ
=
R[J
]
for
the
group
ring
of
J
with
coeﬃcients
in
R.
Thus,
RJ
is
a
commutative
R-algebra,
and
we
have
a
natural
augmentation
homomorphism
RJ

R
[which
sends
all
of
the
elements
of
J
to
1].
Moreover,
if
we
write
def
def
M
:
MH
=
R[EH
]

MG
=
R[EG
]
for
the
morphism
of
RJ
-modules
induced
by

on
the
respective
free
R-modules
with
bases
given
by
the
elements
of
EH
,
EG
,
then
M
induces
a
natural
isomorphism
∼
MH
⊗RJ
R
→
MG
.
Thus,
it
follows
from
Proposition
A.1,
(iv),
that,
for
b
≥
1
an
integer,
we
have
[in
the
notation
of
Proposition
A.1]
natural
surjections
LiebR
(MH
)

LiebRJ
(MH
)

LiebR
(MG
)
∼
the
second
of
which
determines
a
natural
isomorphism
LiebRJ
(MH
)⊗RJ
R
→
LiebR
(MG
).
Now
let
P
(X1
,
.
.
.
,
Xd
)
be
an
“alternant
monomial
of
degree
d”
[i.e.,
a
monomial
element
of
LiedZ
(−)
of
the
free
Z-module
on
the
indeterminate
symbols
X1
,
.
.
.
,
Xd
]
in
which
each
Xi
[for
i
=
1,
.
.
.
,
d]
appears
precisely
once.
Then
P
(X1
,
.
.
.
,
Xd
)
determines
an
element
P
(g1

eG

.

.
,
gd

ABSOLUTE

Moreover,
by
allowing
such
P
(X1
,
.
.
.
,
Xd
)
and
g1
,
.
.
.
,
gd
to
vary
appropriately,
we
obtain
a
Hall
basis
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Bour],
Chapter
II,
§2.11]
of
LiedR
(MG
)
[at
least
if
d
≥
2;
if
d
=
1,
then
one
must
also
allow
for
the
unique
g1
to
be
the
identity
element].
Similarly,
by
allowing
such
P
(X1
,
.
.
.
,
Xd
)
and
h1
,
.
.
.
,

we
obtain

Lemma

(Relation

For
any

that

we
have

[where
we
apply
the
RJ

structure
of
EH
and
the
fact
that
evH
=
eH
[cf.
(xi)]].

Next,
let
us
assume
that
we
have
also
been
given
the
following
data:
(xii)
a
topological
R-module
Λ
equipped
with
a
continuous
action
by
Γ
[which
thus
determines,
via
the
natural
surjection
ΔΓ

Γ,
a
continuous
action
by
ΔΓ
on
Λ].
Write:
def
VΓ
=
V

Γ
⊆
ΔΓ
;
def
FJ
=
J
·
P
(h1
·
eH
,
.
.
.
,
hd
·
eH
)
⊆
LiedRJ
(MH
);
def
R[FJ
]
=
R
·
FJ
=
RJ
·
P
(h1
·
eH
,
.
.
.
,
hd
·
eH
)
⊆
LiedRJ
(MH
);
def
Λ[FJ
]
=
R[FJ
]
⊗R
Λ
⊆
LiedRJ
(MH
)⊗R
;
Λ
def
F
=
P
(g1
·
eG
,
.
.
.
,
gd
·
eG
)
∈
LiedR
(MG
);
def
R[F
]
=
R
·
F
⊆
LiedR
(MG
);
def
Λ[F
]
=
R[F
]
⊗R
Λ
⊆
LiedR
(MG
)
⊗R
Λ
Thus,
the
natural
surjection
LiedRJ
(MH
)

LiedR
(MG
)
determines
[compatible]
natural
surjections
FJ

{F
},
R[FJ
]

R[F
],
Λ[FJ
]

Λ[F
].
Also,
we
observe
[cf.
the
84
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
fact
that
LiedRJ
(MH
)
is
a
ﬁnitely
generated
free
RJ
-module]
that
FJ
is
a
J-torsor
[relative
to
the
action
from
the
left],
hence,
in
particular,
a
ﬁnite
set.
Now
observe
that
since
VΓ
acts
trivially
on
G,
eH
[cf.
(ix),
(x),
(xi)],
it
follows
immediately
that
VΓ
acts
compatibly
on
FJ
,
R[FJ
],
Λ[FJ
],
F
,
R[F
],
Λ[F
],
and
that
the
natural
action
of
VΓ
on
R[G]
preserves
ζ.
In
particular,
it
follows
that
VΓ
preserves
Jζ
⊆
J,
hence
that
VΓ
acts
naturally
on
the
set
of
orbits
(FJ
)
Fζ
of
FJ
with
respect
to
the
action
of
Jζ
;
moreover,
by
Lemma
A.3,
it
follows
that
this
action
of
VΓ
on
Fζ
factors
through
the
quotient
VΓ

Γ.
Now
let
us
consider
invariants
with
respect
to
the
various
superscript
actions
under
consideration.
Let
us
write
Invar(−,
−)
for
the
set
of
invariants
of
the
second
argument
in
parentheses
with
respect
to
the
superscript
action
of
the
group
given
by
the
ﬁrst
argument
in
parentheses.
Then
any
element
η
∈
Invar(VΓ
,
Λ[FJ
])
may
be
regarded
as
a
Λ-valued
function
on
the
set
FJ
which
descends
[cf.
Lemma
A.3]
to
a
Γ-invariant
Λ-valued
function
on
Fζ
,
i.e.,
an
element
ηζ
∈
Invar(Γ,
Λ[Fζ
]).
Next,
let
us
observe
that
[since
ηζ
is
Γ-invariant]
the
sum
of
the
values
∈
Λ
of
the
Λ
valued
function
on
Fζ
determined
by
ηζ
is
a
Γ-invariant
element
ηζ
∈
Invar(Γ,
Λ).
Thus,
the
sum

η∈Λ
of
the
values
∈
Λ
of
the
Λ-valued
function
on
FJ
determined
by
η
satisﬁes
the
relation


ηζ
η
=
|Jζ
|
·

in
Λ.
But
the
image
of
η
in
Λ[F
]
is
precisely
the
element
(
η)
·
F
.
Thus,
since,
by
Lemma
A.2,
|Jζ
|
is
divisible
by
N
,
we
conclude
the
following:
Lemma
A.4.
(Monomial-wise
Computation
of
Invariants)
The
image
Im(Invar(VΓ
,
Λ[FJ
]))
⊆
Λ[F
]
of
Invar(VΓ
,
Λ[FJ
])
⊆
Λ[FJ
]
in
Λ[F
]
lies
in
N
·
Invar(Γ,
Λ[F
]).
Thus,
by
allowing
P
(X1

)
and
h1
,
.
.
.
,
hd
