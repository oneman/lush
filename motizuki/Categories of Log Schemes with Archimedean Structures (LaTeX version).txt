The Main Theorem
Abstract

In this paper, we generalize the main result of [Mzk2] (to the eﬀect that
very general noetherian log schemes may be reconstructed from naturally
associated categories) to the case of log schemes locally of ﬁnite type over
Zariski localizations of the ring of rational integers which are, moreover,
equipped with certain “archimedean structures”.

1.

Introduction

As is discussed in the Introduction to [Mzk2], it is natural to ask to what
extent various objects — such as log schemes — that occur in arithmetic geometry may be represented by categories, i.e., to what extent one may reconstruct
the original object solely from the category-theoretic structure of a category
naturally associated to the object. As is explained in loc. cit., this point of
view is partially motivated by the anabelian philosophy of Grothendieck.

In the present paper, we extend the theory of [Mzk2], which only concerns
log schemes, to obtain a theory that proves a similar categorical representability
result [cf. Theorem 5.1 below] for what we call “arithmetic log schemes” [cf.
Deﬁnitions 4.1, 4.2 below], i.e., log schemes that are locally of ﬁnite type over a
Zariski localization of the ring of rational integers and, moreover, are equipped
with certain “archimedean structures” at archimedean primes.
In §3, we review the theory of [Mzk2], and revise the formulation of the
main theorem of [Mzk2] slightly [cf. Theorem 3.1]. In §4, we deﬁne the notion
of an archimedean structure on a ﬁne, saturated log scheme which is of ﬁnite
type over a Zariski localization of Z. Finally, in §5, we generalize Theorem 3.1
[cf. Theorem 5.1] so as to take into account these archimedean structures.

I would like to thank Akio Tamagawa and Makoto Matsumoto for many
helpful comments concerning the material presented in this paper.

Notations and Conventions

Numbers:
We will denote by N the set (or, occasionally, the commutative monoid)
of natural numbers, by which we take to consist set of the integers n ≥ 0. A
number ﬁeld is deﬁned to be a ﬁnite extension of the ﬁeld of rational numbers
Q. The ﬁeld of real numbers (respectively, complex numbers) will be denoted
by R (respectively, C). The topological group of complex numbers of unit norm
will be denoted by S1 ⊆ C.
We shall say that a scheme S is a Zariski localization of Z if S = Spec(R),
where R = M −1 · Z, for some multiplicative subset M ⊆ Z.
Topological Spaces:
In this paper, the term “compact” is to be understood to include the assumption that the topological space in question is Hausdorﬀ. (The author
wishes to thank A. Tamagawa for his comments concerning the importance of
making this assumption explicit.)
Also, when a topological space H is equipped with an involution σ (typically an action of “complex conjugation”), we shall denote by
HR
(i.e., a superscript “R”) the quotient topological space of “σ-orbits”.
Categories:
Let C be a category. We shall denote the collection of objects of C by:
Ob(C)

Categories of Log Schemes with Archimedean Structures

If A ∈ Ob(C) is an object of C, then we shall denote by
CA
the category whose objects are morphisms B → A of C and whose morphisms
(from an object B1 → A to an object B2 → A) are A-morphisms B1 → B2 in
C. Thus, we have a natural functor
(jA )! : CA → C
(given by forgetting the structure morphism to A). Similarly, if f : A → B is
a morphism in C, then f deﬁnes a natural functor
f! : CA → CB
by mapping an arrow (i.e., an object of CA) C → A to the object of CB given
by the composite C → A → B with f.
If the category C admits ﬁnite products, then (jA )! is left adjoint to the
natural functor
∗
: C → CA
jA

given by taking the product with A, and f! is left adjoint to the natural functor
f ∗ : CB → CA
given by taking the ﬁbered product over B with A.
We shall call an object A ∈ Ob(C) terminal if for every object B ∈ Ob(C),
there exists a unique arrow B → A in C. We shall call an object A ∈ Ob(C)
quasi-terminal if for every object B ∈ Ob(C), there exists an arrow φ : B →
A in C, and, moreover, for every other arrow ψ : B → A, there exists an
automorphism α of A such that ψ = α ◦ φ.
We shall refer to a natural transformation between functors all of whose
component morphisms are isomorphisms as an isomorphism between the functors in question. A functor φ : C1 → C2 between categories C1 , C2 will be called
rigid if φ has no nontrivial automorphisms. A category C will be called slim if
the natural functor CA → C is rigid, for every A ∈ Ob(C).
If C if a category and S is a collection of arrows in C, then we shall say that
an arrow A → B is minimal-adjoint to S if every factorization A → C → B of
this arrow A → B in C such that A → C lies in S satisﬁes the property that
A → C is, in fact, an isomorphism. Often, the collection S will be taken to be
the collection of arrows satisfying a particular property P; in this case, we shall
refer to the property of being “minimal-adjoint to S” as the minimal-adjoint
notion to P.

Review of the Theory for Log Schemes

We begin our discussion by reviewing the theory for log schemes developed
in [Mzk2]. Also, we give a slight extension of this theory (to the case of locally

4

noetherian log schemes and morphisms which are locally of ﬁnite type). In the
context of this extension, it is natural to modify the notation used in [Mzk2]
slightly as follows:
Let us denote by
Schlog
the category of all locally noetherian ﬁne saturated log schemes and locally ﬁnite
type morphisms, and by
NSchlog
the category of all noetherian ﬁne saturated log schemes and ﬁnite type morphisms. Note that
NSchlog ⊆ Schlog
may be characterized as the full subcategory consisting of the X log for which X
is noetherian.
If X log is a ﬁne saturated log scheme whose underlying scheme X is locally
noetherian, then we shall write
def

Schlog (X log ) = (Schlog )X log
and
NSchlog (X log ) ⊆ Schlog (X log )
for the full subcategory consisting of the Y log → X log for which Y is noetherian.
Thus, when X is noetherian, we have NSchlog (X log ) = (NSchlog )X log .
To simplify terminology, we shall often refer to the domain Y log of an arrow
log
→ X log which is an object of Schlog (X log ) or NSchlog (X log ) as an “object
Y
of Schlog (X log ) or NSchlog (X log )”.
If X log , Y log are locally noetherian ﬁne saturated log schemes, then denote
∼
the set of isomorphisms of log schemes X log → Y log by:
Isom(X log , Y log )
Then the main result of [Mzk2] [cf. [Mzk2], Theorem 2.19] states that the
natural map
Isom(X log , Y log ) → Isom(NSchlog (Y log ), NSch(X log ))
given by f log → NSchlog (f log ) [i.e., mapping an isomorphism to the induced
equivalence between “NSchlog (−)’s”] is bijective. (Here, the “Isom” on the right
is to be understood to denote isomorphism classes of equivalences between the
two categories in parentheses.) This result generalizes immediately to the case
of “Schlog (−)”:

Theorem 3.1.
(Categorical Reconstruction of Locally Noetherian Fine Saturated Log Schemes) Let X log , Y log be locally noetherian
ﬁne saturated log schemes. Then the natural map
Isom(X log , Y log ) → Isom(Schlog (Y log ), Schlog (X log ))
is bijective.

Proof. Indeed, by functoriality and [Mzk2], Theorem 2.19, it suﬃces to
show that the subcategory
NSchlog (X log ) ⊆ Schlog (X log )
may be recovered “category-theoretically”.
To see this, let us ﬁrst observe that the proof given in [Mzk2] [cf. [Mzk2],
Corollary 2.14] of the category-theoreticity of the property that a morphism in
NSchlog (X log ) be “scheme-like” (i.e., that the log structure on the domain is the
pull-back of the log structure on the codomain) is entirely valid in Schlog (X log ).
(Indeed, the proof essentially only involves morphisms among “one-pointed
objects”, which are the same in NSchlog (X log ), Schlog (X log ).) Moreover, once
one knows which morphisms are scheme-like, the open immersions may be
characterized category-theoretically as in [Mzk2], Corollary 1.3.
Next, let us ﬁrst observe that the property that a collection of open immersions
Yαlog → Y log
(where α ranges over the elements of some index set A) in Schlog (X log ) be
surjective is category-theoretic. Indeed, this follows from the fact that this
collection is surjective if and only if, for any morphism Z log → Y log , where
Z log is nonempty, the ﬁber product Yαlog ×Y log Z log in Schlog (X log ) [cf. [Mzk2],
Lemma 2.6] is nonempty for some α [cf. also [Mzk2], Proposition 1.1, (i),
applied to the complement of the union of the images of the Yαlog ].
Thus, it suﬃces to observe that an object Y log is noetherian if and only if,
for any surjective collection of open immersions (in Schlog (X log )) Yαlog → Y log
(where α ranges over the elements of some index set A), there exists a ﬁnite
subset B ⊆ A such that the collection {Yβlog → Y log }β∈B is surjective.

Remark 1.

Similar [but easier] results hold for
Sch (respectively, NSch)

— i.e., the category of all locally noetherian schemes and locally ﬁnite type
morphisms (respectively, all noetherian log schemes and ﬁnite type morphisms).

Archimedean Structures

In this §, we generalize the categories deﬁned in [Mzk2] so as to include
archimedean primes. In particular, we prepare for the proof in §5 below of a
global arithmetic analogue [cf. Theorem 5.1] of Theorem 3.1.
Let X log be a ﬁne, saturated locally noetherian log scheme (with underlying
scheme X).
Deﬁnition 4.1.
We shall say that X is arithmetically (locally) of ﬁnite
type if X is (locally) of ﬁnite type over a Zariski localization of Z. Similarly,
we shall say that X log is arithmetically (locally) of ﬁnite type if X is.
def

Suppose that X log is arithmetically locally of ﬁnite type. Then XQlog =
log
X ⊗Z Q is locally of ﬁnite type over Q. In particular, the set of C-valued
points
X(C)
is equipped with a natural topology (induced by the topology of C), together
with an involution σX : X(C) → X(C) induced by the complex conjugation
automorphism on C. Similarly, in the logarithmic context, it is natural to
consider the topological space

×
}
s.t. θ(f) = f(x)/|f (x)|, ∀f ∈ OX,x

(4.1)
(4.2)

[cf. [KN], §1.2]. Here, we use the notation MX to denote the monoid that
deﬁnes the log structure of X log [cf. [Mzk2], §2]. Thus, we have a natural
surjection
X log (C) → X(C)
whose ﬁbers are (noncanonically) isomorphic to products of ﬁnitely many copies
of S1 . Also, we observe that it follows immediately from the deﬁnition that σX
extends to an involution σX log on X log (C).
Deﬁnition 4.2.
(i) Let H ⊆ X(C) be a compact subset stabilized by σX . Then we shall refer to
a pair X = (X, H) as an arithmetic scheme, and H as the archimedean structure on X. We shall say that an archimedean structure H ⊆ X(C) is trivial
(respectively, total) if H = ∅ (respectively, H = X(C)).
(ii) Let H ⊆ X log (C) be a compact subset stabilized by σX log . Then we

log

shall refer to a pair X
= (X log , H) as an arithmetic log scheme, and H
log
as the archimedean structure on X . We shall say that an archimedean
structure H ⊆ X log (C) is trivial (respectively, total) if H = ∅ (respectively,
H = X log (C)).

Remark 2. The idea that “integral structures at archimedean primes”
should be given by compact/bounded subsets of the set of complex valued points
may be seen in the discussion of [Mzk1], p. 9; cf. also Remark 8 below.

Remark 3. Relative to Deﬁnition 4.2, one may think of the case where
“H” is open as the case of an ind-arithmetic (log) scheme [or, alternatively,
an “ind-archimedean structure”], i.e., the inductive system of arithmetic (log)
schemes [or, alternatively, archimedean structures] determined by considering
all compact subsets that lie inside the given open.
Let us denote the category of all arithmetic log schemes by:
Sch
log

log
log

Thus, a morphism X 1 = (X1log , H1 ) → X 2 = (X2log , H2 ) in this category
is a locally ﬁnite type morphism X1log → X2log such that the induced map
X1log (C) → X2log (C) maps H1 into H2 . The full subcategory of noetherian
objects of Sch
denoted by:

log

[i.e., objects whose underlying scheme is noetherian] will be
log

NSch

⊆ Sch

log

Similarly, if we forget about log structures, we obtain categories NSch, Sch.

Deﬁnition 4.3.
(i) An arithmetic (log) scheme will be called purely nonarchimedean if its
archimedean structure is trivial.
(ii) A morphism between arithmetic (log) schemes will be called purely archimedean if the underlying morphism between (log) schemes is an isomorphism.
Denote by
Schlog ⊆ Schlog

8

the full subcategory determined by those objects which are arithmetically locally
of ﬁnite type. Then note that by considering purely nonarchimedean objects,
we obtain a natural embedding
log

Schlog → Sch
log

of Schlog as a full subcategory of Sch .
log
log
If X ∈ Ob(Sch ), then we shall write

)

→X
are purely archimedean arrows
for the subcategory whose objects Y
log
log
log
of Sch . (Thus, the morphisms Y 1 → Y 2 of this subcategory are also
necessarily purely archimedean.)
On the other hand, if T is a topological space, then let us write
Open(T ) (respectively, Closed(T ))
for the category whose objects are open subsets U ⊆ T (respectively, closed
subsets F ⊆ T ) and whose morphisms are inclusions of subsets of T . Thus, one
veriﬁes easily (by taking complements!) that Closed(T ) is the opposite category
Open(T )opp associated to Open(T ). Also, let us write
Shv(T )
for the category of sheaves on T (valued in sets).
Now we have the following:

is an equivalence of categories that preserves purely archimedean arrows
log
log
(i.e., an arrow f in Sch (X 1 ) is purely archimedean if and only if Φ(f)
log
is purely archimedean). Then one can construct, for every object Y 1 =
log
log
log
(Y1log , K1 ) ∈ Ob(Sch (X 1 )) that maps via Φ to an object Y 2 = (Y2log , K2 ) ∈
log

Ob(Sch

log

(X 2 )), a homeomorphism
∼

K1R → K2R
which is functorial in Y1log .

Proof. Assertion (i) is a formal consequence of the deﬁnitions. To prove
assertion (ii), let us ﬁrst observe that (for an arbitrary topological space T )
Shv(T ) may be reconstructed functorially from Open(T ), since coverings of
objects of Open(T ) may be characterized as collections of objects whose inductive limit (a purely categorical notion!) is isomorphic to the object to be
covered. Thus, our assumption on Φ, together with assertion (i), implies that
(for i = 1, 2) Shv(KiR ) may be reconstructed category-theoretically from Yilog
in a fashion which is functorial in Yilog . Moreover, since KiR is clearly a sober
topological space, we thus conclude [by a well-known result from “topos theory” — cf., e.g., [Mzk2], Theorem 1.4] that the topological space KiR itself may
be reconstructed category-theoretically from Yilog in a fashion which is functorial
in Yilog , as desired.
Before proceeding, we observe the following:

Lemma 4.1.
(Finite Products of Arithmetic Log Schemes) The
log
category Sch admits ﬁnite products.

log

Proof. Indeed, if, for i = 1, 2, 3, we are given objects X i

Ob(Sch ) and morphisms X1log → X2log , X3log → X2log in Sch , then we may
form the product of X1log , X3log over X2log by equipping the log scheme
X1log ×X log X3log
2

(which is easily seen to be arithmetically locally of ﬁnite type) with the archimedean
structure given by the inverse image of
H1 ×H2 H3 ⊆ X1log (C) ×X log (C) X3log (C)
2

10

(where we note that H1 ×H2 H3 is compact, since H2 is Hausdorﬀ) via the
natural map:
(X1log ×X log X3log )(C) → X1log (C) ×X log (C) X3log (C)
2

2

Note that this last map is proper [i.e., inverse images of compact sets are compact], since, for any Y log which is arithmetically locally of ﬁnite type, the map
Y log (C) → Y (C) is proper, and, moreover, the map induced on C-valued points
of underlying schemes by
X1log ×X log X3log → X1 ×X2 X3
2

[i.e., where the domain is equipped with the trivial log structure] is ﬁnite [cf.
[Mzk2], Lemma 2.6], hence proper.

(by sending an object Z → Y

Next, we would like to show, in the following discussion [cf. Corollary 4.1,
(ii) below], that the hypothesis of Proposition 4.1, (ii), is automatically satisﬁed.

Let X ∈ Ob(Sch ).

Proposition 4.2.
(Minimal Objects) An object Y

will be called minimal if it is nonempty and satisﬁes the property that any

monomorphism Z  Y
(where Z
is nonempty) in Sch (X ) is neclog

essarily an isomorphism. An object Y
of Sch (X ) is minimal if and
only if it is purely nonarchimedean and log scheme-theoretically minimal [i.e., the underlying object Y log of Schlog (X log ) is minimal as an object of
Sch(X log ) — cf. [Mzk2], Proposition 2.4].

Proof. The suﬃciency of this condition is clear, since the domain of any
log
morphism in Sch
to a purely nonarchimedean object is necessarily itself
purely nonarchimedean [i.e., no nonempty set maps to an empty set]. That
this condition is necessary is evident from the deﬁnitions (e.g., if a nonempty
object fails to be purely nonarchimedean, then it can always be “made smaller”
[but still nonempty!] by setting the archimedean structure equal to the empty
set, thus precluding “minimality”).

the archimedean structure of Z 1 .)

Proof. Assertion (i) is a formal consequence of Proposition 4.5 [and the
deﬁnitions of the terms involved]. As for assertion (ii), the necessity of the condition is a formal consequence of the deﬁnitions of the terms involved. To prove
suﬃciency, let us ﬁrst observe that by [Mzk2], Lemma 2.2; [Mzk2], Proposition
2.3, it follows from this condition that the underlying morphism of log schemes
Y log → Z log is scheme-like [i.e., the log structure on Y log is the pull-back of the
log structure on Z log ]. Thus, this condition implies that the underlying morphism of schemes Y → Z is smooth [cf. [Mzk2], Corollary 1.2] and surjective.
But this implies [cf. [Mzk2], Corollary 1.3] that Y → Z is a surjective open
immersion, hence that it is an isomorphism of schemes. Since Y log → Z log
is scheme-like, we thus conclude that Y log → Z log is an isomorphism of log
schemes, as desired.
Thus, Corollary 4.1, (ii), implies that the hypothesis of Proposition 4.1 is
automatically satisﬁed. This allows us to conclude the following:
Corollary 4.2.
(Unconditional Reconstruction of the Archimedean Topological Space) The R-superscripted topological space determined
log
log
log
by the ar-chimedean structure on an object Y

reconstructed category-theoretically in a fashion which is functorial in Y

[cf. Proposition 4.1, (ii)]. In particular, the condition that Y
be purely
nonarchimedean is category-theoretic in nature.

Theorem 3.1] the underlying log scheme Y log associated to Y
may be reconstructed category-theoretically from this data in a fashion which is functolog
rial in Y .

hence the topological space Y (C) from category-theoretic data. On the
other hand, by Corollary 4.2, one may also reconstruct the topological space
K R (⊆ Y log (C)R ). Thus, the question arises:

The Main Theorem

In the following discussion, we complete the proof of the main theorem of
the present paper by showing that the archimedean and scheme-theoretic data
reconstructed in Corollaries 4.2, 4.3 are compatible with one another.

log

Deﬁnition 5.1.
We shall say that an object S
of Sch
is a test
object if its underlying scheme is aﬃne, connected, and normal, and, moreover,
the R-superscripted topological space determined by its archimedean structure
consists of precisely one point.
Note that by Corollaries 4.2, 4.3, the notion of a “test object” is “categorytheoretic”.
log

Lemma 5.1.
(Nonlogarithmic Global Compatibility) Let X be
log
log
log
log
an object in Sch . Then every object S
∈ Ob(Sch (X )) is nonlogarithmically globally compatible.

Proof. By the functoriality of the diagram discussed in Remark 4, it follows immediately that it suﬃces to prove the nonlogarithmic global compatilog
bility of test objects S = (S log , HS ). Since S is assumed to be aﬃne, write
S = Spec(R). Then we may think of the single point of HSR as deﬁning an
“archimedean valuation” vR on the ring R.
Write
Y

log

= (Y log , HY ) → S
log

log

= (S log , HS )

for the projective line over S , equipped with the log structure obtained by
pulling back the log structure of S log and the archimedean structure which is the
log
inverse image of the archimedean structure of S . Note that this archimedean
structure may be characterized “category-theoretically” [cf. Corollaries 4.2, 4.3]
as the archimedean structure which yields a quasi-terminal object [cf. §2] in the
log
log
subcategory of Sch (S ) consisting of purely archimedean morphisms among
objects with underlying log scheme isomorphic (over S log ) to Y log .
Next, let us observe that to reconstruct the log scheme S log via Corollary
4.3 amounts, in eﬀect, to applying the theory of [Mzk2]. Moreover, in the theory
of [Mzk2], the set underlying the ring R = Γ(S, OS ) is reconstructed as the set
log
log
of sections S
→ Y
that avoid the ∞-section (of the projective line Y ).
Moreover, the topology determined on R by the “archimedean valuation” vR
is precisely the topology on this set of sections determined by considering the
log
log
induced sections HSR → HYR [i.e., two sections S
→Y
are “close” if and
only if their induced sections HSR → HYR are “close”]. Thus, we conclude (via
Corollary 4.2) that this topology on R is a “category-theoretic invariant”.
On the other hand, it is immediate that the point R → C (considered up to
complex conjugation) determined by HSR may be recovered from this topology
— i.e., by “completing” with respect to this topology. This completes the proof
of the asserted nonlogarithmic global compatibility.

Lemma 5.2.
(Logarithmic Global Compatibility) Let X
be an
log
log
log
log
object in Sch . Then every object S ∈ Ob(Sch (X )) is globally compatible.

Proof. The proof is entirely similar to the proof of Lemma 5.1. In parlog
is a test object. Since,
ticular, we reduce immediately to the case where S
by Corollary 4.3, the structure of the underlying log scheme S log is already
known to be category-theoretic, we may even assume, without loss of generality, that the monoid MS is generated by its global sections. This time, instead
log
of considering Y , we consider the object
Z

log

= (Z log , HZ ) → S

log

= (S log , HS )

obtained by “appending” to the log structure of Y log the log structure determined by the divisor given by the zero section (of the projective line Y ). As in
log
log
the case of Y , we take the archimedean structure on Z
to be the inverse
log
log
image of the archimedean structure of S . Also, just as in the case of Y ,
this archimedean structure may be characterized category-theoretically.
Now if we think of the unique point in HSR as a pair (up to complex
conjugation) (s, θ) [cf. the discussion preceding Deﬁnition 4.2], then it remains
to show that θ may be “recovered category-theoretically”. To this end, let us
ﬁrst recall that s ∈ S(C) determines a morphism Spec(C) → S with respect to
which one may pull-back the log structure on S to obtain a log structure on
Spec(C). By Lemma 5.1, we may also assume, without loss of generality, that
S is “suﬃciently [Zariski] local with respect to s” in the sense that the image
of Γ(S, OS× ) in C is dense. Moreover, this log structure on Spec(C) amounts to
the datum of a monoid
MS,s
containing the unit circle S1 ⊆ C. Thus, relative to this notation, θ [cf. the discussion preceding Deﬁnition 4.2] may be thought of as the datum of a surjective
homomorphism
gp
 S1
θ : MS,s

[where surjectivity follows from the fact that this homomorphism restricts to
gp
the identity on S1 ⊆ MS,s
]. In fact, since θ is required to restrict to the identity
gp
on S1 ⊆ MS,s ⊆ MS,s
, it follows that the surjection θ is completely determined
by its kernel. Thus, in summary, θ may be thought of as being the datum of
gp
a certain quotient of the group MS,s
, or, indeed, as a certain quotient of the
monoid MS,s .
Next, let us recall [cf. the proof of Lemma 5.1] that in the theory of
[Mzk2][cf. the discussion preceding [Mzk2], Lemma 2.16], the set
Γ(S, MS )

log

is reconstructed as the set of sections S → Z that avoid the ∞-section (of
the projective line Z). Observe that [just as in the proof of Lemma 5.1] this
set of sections is equipped with a natural topology determined by the induced
log
log
are “close” if and only if
sections HSR → HZR — i.e., two sections S → Z
their induced sections HSR → HZR are “close”. Thus, from the point of view of
elements of Γ(S, MS ), two elements of Γ(S, MS ) are “close” if and only if their
gp
with
images under the composite of the natural morphism Γ(S, MS ) → MS,s
the surjection θ are “close”. In particular, if we denote by
Γ(S, MS )θ
the completion of the set Γ(S, MS ) with respect to this [not necessarily separated] topology, then it follows immediately [from our assumption that S is
“suﬃciently [Zariski] local with respect to s”] that the image of Γ(S, OS× ) ⊆
Γ(S, MS ) in this completion may be identiﬁed with S1 . Since, moreover, sequences of elements of Γ(S, MS ) that converge to elements of MS,s that lie in
the kernel of θ clearly map to 0 in the completion Γ(S, MS )θ , we conclude that
the closure of the image of Γ(S, OS× ) in Γ(S, MS )θ [which may be identiﬁed
with a copy of S1 ] is, in fact, equal to Γ(S, MS )θ , and, moreover, that relative
to this identiﬁcation of Γ(S, MS )θ with S1 , the natural completion morphism
Γ(S, MS ) → Γ(S, MS )θ = S1
may be identiﬁed with the composite of the natural morphism Γ(S, MS ) →
gp
with θ. That is to say, [in light of our assumption that the monoid
MS,s
MS is generated by its global sections] the kernel of θ, hence θ itself, may be
recovered from the following data: the log scheme S log [as reconstructed in
[Mzk2]], together with the topology considered above on Γ(S, MS ). Since this
topology is “category-theoretic” by Corollary 4.2, this completes the proof of
Lemma 5.2.
We are now ready to state the main result of the present §, i.e., the following
global arithmetic analogue of Theorem 3.1:
Theorem 5.1.
(Categorical Reconstruction of Arithmetic Log
log
log
Schemes) Let X , Y
be arithmetic log schemes. Then the categories
log
log
log

Sch (Y ), Sch (X ) are slim [cf. §2], and the natural map
Isom(X

log

,Y

log

log

) → Isom(Sch

(Y

log

), Sch

(X

))

is bijective.

Proof. Indeed, this is a formal consequence of Corollaries 4.2, 4.3; Lemma
5.2; [Mzk2], Theorem 2.20.

Remark 5. The natural map of Theorem 5.1 is obtained by considering
the natural functors mentioned in the discussion following Lemma 4.1.

Remark 6. Of course, similar [but easier!] arguments yield the exlog
pected versions of Theorem 5.1 for NSch , Sch, NSch:
log

(ii) If X, Y are arithmetic schemes, then the categories Sch(Y ), Sch(X)
are slim, and the natural map
Isom(X, Y ) → Isom(Sch(Y ), Sch(X))
is bijective.
(iii) If X, Y are noetherian arithmetic schemes, then the categories NSch(Y ),
NSch(X) are slim, and the natural map
Isom(X, Y ) → Isom(NSch(Y ), NSch(X))
is bijective.

Example 5.1.

(Arithmetic Vector Bundles)

(i) Let F be a number ﬁeld; denote the associated ring of integers by OF ;
def

write S = Spec(OF ). Equip S with the archimedean structure given by the
whole of S(C); denote the resulting arithmetic scheme by S. Let E be a vector
bundle on S. Write V → S for the result of blowing up the associated geometric
vector bundle along its zero section; denote the resulting exceptional divisor [i.e.,
the inverse image of the zero section via the blow-up morphism] by D ⊆ V .
If E is equipped with a Hermitian metric at each archimedean prime (up to
complex conjugation) of F , then, by taking the “archimedean structure” on
V to be the complex-valued points of V that correspond to sections of E with
norm (relative to this Hermitian metric) ≤ 1 [hence include the complex-valued
points of D], we obtain an arithmetic scheme V over S. Now suppose that S
is equipped with a log structure deﬁned by some ﬁnite set Σ of closed points

log

of S; denote the resulting arithmetic log scheme by S . Equip V with the
log structure obtained by “appending” to the log structure pulled back from
S log the log structure determined by the divisor D ⊆ V . Thus, we obtain a
morphism of arithmetic log schemes:
V
log

log

→S

log

log

The sections S
→ V
of this morphism correspond naturally to the elements of Γ(S, E) which are nonzero away from Σ and have norm ≤ 1 at all the
archimedean primes.

log

(ii) For i = 1, 2, let V i → S i be constructed as in (i) above. Then (by
Theorem 5.1) the isomorphism classes of equivalences of categories
Sch

log

log

(V 1 ) → Sch

(V 2 )

bundles E1 → E2 lying over an isomorphism of log schemes S1log → S2log .
(iii) We shall refer to a subset
A⊆C
as an angular region if there exists a ρ ∈ R>0 [where R>0 ⊆ R is the subset
of real numbers > 0] and a subset AS1 ⊆ S1 ⊆ C such that A = {λ · u | λ ∈
[0, ρ], u ∈ AS1 }. We shall say that the angular region A is open (respectively,
closed; isotropic) [i.e., as an angular region] if the subset AS1 ⊆ S1 is open
(respectively, closed; equal to S1 ); we shall refer to ρ as the radius of the
angular region A. Thus, if we write
def

Ang(C) = C× /R>0
[so the natural composite S1 → C  Ang(C) is a homeomorphism], then the
projection
Ang(A) ⊆ Ang(C)
∼ S1 is simply A1 . Note that the notion of an anof A [i.e., A\{0}] to Ang(C) =
S
gular region (respectively, open angular region; closed angular region; Ang(−);
radius of an angular region) extends immediately to the case where “C” is
replaced by an an arbitrary 1-dimensional complex vector space (respectively,
vector space; vector space; vector space; vector space equipped with a Hermitian metric).
In particular, in the notation of (i), when E is a line bundle, the choice
of a(n) closed (respectively, open) angular region of radius 1 at each of the
complex archimedean primes of F determines a(n) (ind-)archimedean structure
[cf. Remark 3] on V log . Thus, the (ind-)arithmetic log schemes discussed in (i)
correspond to the case where all of the angular regions chosen are isotropic.

Remark 7. When the vector bundle E of Example 5.1 is a line bundle
[i.e., of rank one], the blow-up used to construct V is an isomorphism. That is
to say, in this case, V is simply the geometric line bundle associated to E, and
D ⊆ V is its zero section.

Remark 8. Some readers may wonder why, in Deﬁnition 4.2, we took
H to be a compact set, as opposed to, say, an open set (or, perhaps, an open set
which is, in some sense, “bounded”). One reason for this is the following: If H
were required to be open, then we would be obliged, in Example 5.1, to take the
“archimedean structure” on V to be the open set deﬁned by sections of norm
< 1. In particular, if E is taken to be the trivial line bundle, then it would
follow that the section of V deﬁned by the section “1” of the trivial bundle
would fail to deﬁne a morphism in the “category of arithmetic log schemes” —
a situation which the author found to be unacceptable.
Another motivating reason for Deﬁnition 4.2 comes from rigid geometry:
That is to say, in the context of rigid geometry, perhaps the most basic example
of an integral structure on the aﬃne line Spec(Qp [T ]) is that given by the ring
Zp [T ]∧
(where the “∧” denotes p-adic completion). Then the continuous homomorphisms Zp [T ]∧ → Cp [i.e., the “Cp -valued points of the integral structure”]
correspond precisely to the elements of Cp with absolute value ≤ 1.

def

Remark 9. If S = Spec(OF ) [where OF is the ring of integers of a
number ﬁeld F ], and we equip S with the log structure associated to the chart
N  1 → 0 ∈ OS , then an archimedean structure on S log is not the same as
a choice of Hermitian metrics on the trivial line bundle over OS at various
archimedean primes of S. This is somewhat counter-intuitive, from the point
of view of the usual theory of log schemes. More generally:
The deﬁnition of an archimedean structure [cf. Deﬁnition 4.2] adopted
in this paper is perhaps not so satisfactory when one wishes to consider the archimedean aspects of log structures or other inﬁnitesimal
deformations (e.g., nilpotent thickenings) in detail.
For instance, the possible choices of an archimedean structure are invariant with
respect to nilpotent thickenings. Thus, depending on the situation in which one
wishes to apply the theory of the present paper, it may be desirable to modify
Deﬁnition 4.2 so as to deal with archimedean structures on log structures or
nilpotent thickenings in a more satisfactory matter — perhaps by making use of
the constructions of Example 5.1 [including “angular regions”!], applied to the

Categories of Log Schemes with Archimedean Structures

21

various line bundles or vector bundles that form the log structures or nilpotent
thickenings under consideration.
At the time of writing, however, it is not clear to the author how to construct such a theory. Indeed, many of the complications that appear to arise if
one is to construct such a theory seem to be related to the fact that archimedean
(integral) structures, unlike their nonarchimedean counterparts, typically fail to
be closed under addition. Since, however, such a theory is beyond the scope of
the present paper, we shall not discuss this issue further in the present paper.
