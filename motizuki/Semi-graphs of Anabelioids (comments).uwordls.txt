In
the
third
sentence
of
Example
2.10,
the
phrase
“Now
observe
that
a
hyperbolic
Riemann
surface
of
ﬁnite
type”
should
read
“Now
observe
that
a
hyperbolic
Riemann
surface
of
ﬁnite
type
of
genus
≥
1”.
(2.)
With
regard
to
the
proof
of
Corollary
3.11:
(i)
In
the
ﬁrst
line
of
the
proof,
it
should
be
stipulated
that
the
set
Σ
be
nonempty.
(ii)
The
phrase
“as
in
(ii)”
in
line
2
of
observation
(iv)
should
read
“as
in
(iii)”.
(iii)
A
more
detailed
version
of
the
argument
used
to
verify
observation
(iv)
is
given
in
[AbsTopII],
Corollary
2.11.
(3.)
In
the
discussion
of
the
“pro-Σ
version”
of
Corollary
3.11
in
Remark
3.11.1,
one
should
assume
that
pα
,
pβ
∈
Σ.
In
fact,
this
assumption
is,
in
some
sense,
implicit
in
the
phraseology
that
appears
in
the
ﬁrst
two
lines
of
Remark
3.11.1,
but
it
should
have
been
stated
explicitly.
(4.)
Note
that
in
Theorem
5.4,
the
case
where
A
is
trivial
[i.e.,
is
equal
to
the
anabelioid
associated
to
the
trivial
group
{1}]
is
not
excluded.
Thus,
suppose
that,
in
Theorem
5.4,
we
assume
further
that
A
is
trivial.
Then
let
us
observe
that
this
implies
that
the
underlying
graph
of
G
[or
H]
consists
of
a
single
vertex
and
no
edges.
[Indeed,
if
the
underlying
graph
of
G
has
at
least
one
edge,
then
since
G
is
assumed
to
be
totally
elevated,
it
follows
from
the
assumption
that
G
is
totally
arithmetically
estranged
[cf.
Deﬁnition
5.3,
(ii)]
that
Πtemp
admits
a
closed
subgroup
that
fails
G
to
be
arithmetically
ample,
hence
that
ΠA
=
{1}
contains
a
closed
subgroup
which
is
not
open
—
a
contradiction.]
Thus,
Πtemp
itself
is
a
verticial
subgroup
of
Πtemp
,
G
G
hence
compact.
In
particular,
Πtemp
is
the
unique
maximal
compact
subgroup
of
G
Πtemp
,
so
assertions
(i),
(ii),
and
(iii)
of
Theorem
5.4
are,
in
essence,
vacuous.

In
the
line
2
of
Example
5.6,
the
phrase
“Also,
Suppose...”
should
read
“Also,
suppose...”.
In
lines
7–8
of
Example
5.6,
one
should
also
assume
that
Mi
was
chosen
so
that
the
resulting
Galois
action
on
the
dual
semi-graph
with
compact
structure
of
the
special
ﬁber
of
the
stable
model
is
trivial
[i.e.,
so
as
to
ensure
that
the
assumption
of
Theorem
5.4
concerning
switching
the
branches
of
edges
is
satisﬁed].
(6.)
Some
readers
may
ﬁnd
the
argument
given
in
the
third
and
fourth
paragraphs
of
the
proof
of
Theorem
3.7,
(iii),
to
be
a
bit
confusing
in
its
brevity.
A
more
detailed
argument
may
be
given
as
follows.
For
i
∈
I,
let
us
write
Vi
,
Ei
for
the
sets
of
vertices
and
closed
edges,
respectively,
of
Gi,∞
that
are
ﬁxed
by
the
action
of
H.
Thus,
for
i
≥
j
∈
I,
we
have
natural
maps
Vi
→
Vj
,
Ei
→
Ej
;
let
us
write
Ej,i
⊆
Ej
for
the
image
of
Ei
in
Ej
.
Thus,
for
i1
,
i2
∈
I
such
that
i1
≥
i2
,
we
have
Ej,i1
⊆
Ej,i2
⊆
Ej
.
Also,
we
recall
that,
by
the
argument
given
in
the
second
paragraph
of
the
proof,
we
have
#Vi
≥
1
[where
we
use
the
notation
“#”
to
denote
the
cardinality
of
a
set],
for
all
i
∈
I.
For
simplicity,
in
the
following,
we
assume
that
the
semi-graph
Gi
is
untangled,
for
all
i
∈
I.
Now:
(a)
Suppose
that
for
some
coﬁnal
subset
J
⊆
I,
we
have
#Vj
=
1,
for
all
j
∈
J.
Then
the
unique
elements
of
the
Vj
,
for
j
∈
J,
form
a
compatible
system
of
vertices
ﬁxed
by
H.
Thus,
we
conclude
that
H
is
contained
in
some
verticial
subgroup
of
π1temp
(G).
(b)
Suppose
that
for
some
coﬁnal
subset
J
⊆
I,
we
have
#Vj
≥
2,
for
all
j
∈
J.
Then
it
follows
from
Lemma
1.8,
(ii),
(b),
that
#Ej
≥
1,
for
all
j
∈
J.
Now
I
claim
that
for
each
j
∈
J,
the
following
condition
holds:
(∗j
)
there
exists
an
i
∈
J
such
that
i
≥
j
and
#Ej,i
=
1.
Indeed,
suppose
that
(∗j
)
fails
to
hold.
Then
for
each
i
≥
j
in
J,
there
exists
a
pair
of
distinct
edges
ei
,
ei
∈
Ei
whose
respective
images
ej,i
,
ej,i
∈
Ej
are
distinct.
By
Lemma
1.8,
(ii),
(b),
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
the
generality
that
the
pair
{ei
,
ei
},
hence
also
the
pair
{ej,i
,
ej,i
},
forms
a
subjoint.
Then
since
Gj
is
untangled,
it
follows
that
the
respective
images

of
ej,i
,
ej,i
in
Gj
also
form
a
subjoint.
Write
fi
,
fi
for
the
respective
fj,i
,
fj,i

)
images
of
ei
,
ei
in
Gi
.
Thus,
it
follows
from
the
fact
that
the
pair
(fj,i
,
fj,i

forms
a
subjoint
(of
Gj
)
that
the
pair
(fi
,
fi
)
forms
a
subjoint
(of
Gi
).
Moreover,
for
some
coﬁnal
subset
J
∗
⊆
J,
the
subjoints
(fi
,
fi
),
where
i
∈
J
∗
,
converge,
in
the
proﬁnite
topology,
to
some
proﬁnite
subjoint.
As
discussed
in
the
third
paragraph,
this
leads
to
a
contradiction,
in
light
of
our
assumption
that
G
is
totally
estranged.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
claim.
Now
it
follows
from
(∗j
)
that
each
of
the
nonempty
sets
Ej,i
,
COMMENTS
ON
“SEMI-GRAPHS
OF
ANABELIOIDS”

for
i,
j
∈
J
such
that
i
is
“suﬃciently
large”
relative
to
j,
is
of
cardinality
1.
But
this
implies
that
each
intersection
def
Ej,∞
=

Ej,i
i≥j
is
of
cardinality
1.
Thus,
the
unique
elements
of
the
Ej,∞
,
for
j
∈
J,
form
a
compatible
system
of
closed
edges
ﬁxed
by
H.
In
particular,
we
conclude
that
H
is
contained
in
some
edge-like
subgroup,
hence
also
in
two
distinct
verticial
subgroups,
of
π1temp
(G).
(c)
Now
it
follows
formally
from
(a),
(b)
that
H
is
always
contained
in
some
verticial
subgroup
of
π1temp
(G).
If
H
is
contained
in
three
distinct
verticial
subgroups,
then
it
follows
immediately
from
Lemma
1.8,
(ii),
(b),
that
one
obtains
a
contradiction
to
the
condition
(∗j
)
of
(b).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii)
of
Theorem
3.7.
(7.)
In
Proposition
4.4,
(ii),
the
notation
“G”
should
read
“G”.
(8.)
In
the
context
of
Theorem
4.8,
it
should
be
observed
that
Gi
is
assumed
to
be
a
graph
[i.e.,
not
an
arbitrary
semi-graph!]
of
anabelioids.
Also,
it
should
be
observed
that
it
follows
immediately
from
the
assumption
that
Gi
is
totally
aloof,
together
with
the
deﬁnition
of
the
category
Loc(Gi
,
Γi
),
that
the
map
induced
on
branches
of
underlying
semi-graphs
by
a
locally
trivial
morphism
of
Loc(Gi
,
Γi
)
is
completely
determined
by
the
map
induced
[by
the
morphism
under
consideration]
on
vertices
of
underlying
semi-graphs.
(9.)
The
assertion
stated
in
the
second
display
of
Remark
2.4.2
is
false
as
stated.
[The
automorphisms
of
the
semi-graphs
of
anabelioids
in
Example
2.10
that
arise
from
“Dehn
twists”
constitute
a
well-known
counterexample
to
this
assertion.]
This
assertion
should
be
replaced
by
the
following
slightly
modiﬁed
version
of
this
assertion:
The
isomorphism
classes
of
the
φv
completely
determine
the
isomorphism
class
of
each
of
the
φe
,
as
well
as
each
isomorphism
φb
,
up
to
composition
with
an
automorphism
of
the
composite
1-morphism
of
anabelioids
Ge
→
Hf
→
Hw
that
arises
from
an
automorphism
of
the
1-morphism
of
anabelioids
Ge
→
Hf
.
Also,
in
the
discussion
following
this
assertion
[as
well
as
the
various
places
where
this
discussion
is
applied,
i.e.,
Remark
3.5.2;
the
second
paragraph
of
§4;
Deﬁnition
5.1,
(iv)],
it
is
necessary
to
assume
further
that
the
semi-graphs
of
anabelioids
that
appear
satisfy
the
condition
that
every
edge
abuts
to
at
least
one
vertex.
(10.)
The
phrase
“is
Galois”
at
the
end
of
the
ﬁrst
sentence
of
the
proof
of
Proposition
3.2
should
read
“is
a
countable
coproduct
of
Galois
objects”.

(11.)
In
the
ﬁrst
sentence
of
Deﬁnition
3.5,
(ii),
the
phrase
“Suppose
that”
should
read
“Suppose
that
each
connected
component
of”;
the
phrase
“splits
the
restriction
of”
should
read
“splits
the
restriction
of
this
connected
component
of”.
(12.)
Certain
pathologies
occur
in
the
theory
of
tempered
fundamental
groups
if
one
does
not
impose
suitable
countability
hypotheses.
(i)
In
order
to
discuss
these
countability
hypotheses,
it
will
be
convenient
to
introduce
some
terminology
as
follows:
(T1)
We
shall
say
that
a
tempered
group
is
Galois-countable
if
its
topology
admits
a
countable
basis.
We
shall
say
that
a
connected
temperoid
is
Galois-countable
if
it
arises
from
a
Galois-countable
tempered
group.
We
shall
say
that
a
temperoid
is
Galois-countable
if
it
arises
from
a
collection
of
Galois-countable
connected
temperoids.
We
shall
say
that
a
connected
quasi-temperoid
is
Galois-countable
if
it
arises
from
a
Galoiscountable
connected
temperoid.
We
shall
say
that
a
quasi-temperoid
is
Galois-countable
if
it
arises
from
a
collection
of
Galois-countable
connected
quasi-temperoids.
(T2)
We
shall
say
that
a
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
G
is
Galois-countable
if
it
is
countable,
and,
moreover,
admits
a
countable
collection
of
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
{Gi
→
G}i∈I
such
that
for
any
ﬁnite
étale
covering
H
→
G,
there
exists
an
i
∈
I
such
that
the
base-changed
covering
H
×G
Gi
→
Gi
splits
over
the
constituent
anabelioid
associated
to
each
component
of
[the
underlying
semi-graph
of]
Gi
.
(T3)
We
shall
say
that
a
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
G
is
strictly
coherent
if
it
is
coherent
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.3,
(iii)],
and,
moreover,
each
of
the
proﬁnite
groups
associated
to
components
c
of
[the
underlying
semi-graph
of]
G
[cf.
the
ﬁnal
sentence
of
Deﬁnition
2.3,
(iii)]
is
topologically
generated
by
N
generators,
for
some
positive
integer
N
that
is
independent
of
c.
In
particular,
it
follows
that
if
G
is
ﬁnite
and
coherent,
then
it
is
strictly
coherent.
(T4)
One
veriﬁes
immediately
that
every
strictly
coherent,
countable
semigraph
of
anabelioids
is
Galois-countable.
(T5)
One
veriﬁes
immediately
that
if,
in
Remark
3.2.1,
one
assumes
in
addition
that
the
temperoid
X
is
Galois-countable,
then
it
follows
that
its
associated
tempered
fundamental
group
π1temp
(X
)
is
well-deﬁned
and
Galoiscountable.
(T6)
One
veriﬁes
immediately
that
if,
in
the
discussion
of
the
paragraph
preceding
Proposition
3.6,
one
assumes
in
addition
that
the
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
G
is
Galois-countable,
then
it
follows
that
its
associated
tempered
fundamental
group
π1temp
(G)
and
temperoid
B
temp
(G)
are
welldeﬁned
and
Galois-countable.
Here,
we
note
that,
in
(T5)
and
(T6),
the
Galois-countability
assumption
is
necessary
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
index
sets
of
“universal
covering
pro-objects”
COMMENTS

implicit
in
the
deﬁnition
of
the
tempered
fundamental
group
may
to
be
taken
to
be
countable.
This
countability
of
the
index
sets
involved
implies
that
the
various
objects
that
constitute
such
a
universal
covering
pro-object
admit
a
compatible
system
of
basepoints,
i.e.,
that
the
obstruction
to
the
existence
of
such
a
compatible
system
—
which
may
be
thought
of
as
an
element
of
a
sort
of
“nonabelian
R1
lim
←−”
—
vanishes.
In
order
to
deﬁne
the
tempered
fundamental
group
in
an
intrinsically
meaningful
fashion,
it
is
necessary
to
know
the
existence
of
such
a
compatible
system
of
basepoints.
(ii)
The
eﬀects
of
the
omission
of
Galois-countability
hypotheses
in
§3
on
the
remainder
of
the
present
paper,
as
well
as
on
subsequent
papers
of
the
author,
may
be
summarized
as
follows:
(E1)
First
of
all,
we
observe
that
all
topological
subquotients
of
absolute
Galois
groups
of
ﬁelds
of
countable
cardinality
are
Galois-countable.
(E2)
Also,
we
observe
that
if
k
is
a
ﬁeld
whose
absolute
Galois
group
is
Galoiscountable,
and
U
is
a
nonempty
open
subscheme
of
a
connected
proper
k-scheme
X
that
arises
as
the
underlying
scheme
of
a
log
scheme
that
is
log
smooth
over
k
[where
we
regard
Spec(k)
as
equipped
with
the
trivial
log
structure],
and
whose
interior
is
equal
to
U
,
then
the
tamely
ramiﬁed
arithmetic
fundamental
group
of
U
[i.e.,
that
arises
by
considering
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
U
with
tame
ramiﬁcation
over
the
divisors
that
lie
in
the
complement
of
U
in
X]
is
itself
Galois-countable
[cf.,
e.g.,
[AbsTopI],
Proposition
2.2].
(E3)
Next,
we
observe,
with
regard
to
Examples
2.10,
3.10,
and
5.6,
that
the
tempered
groups
and
temperoids
that
appear
in
these
Examples
are
Galois-countable
[cf.
(E1),
(E2)],
while
the
semi-graphs
of
anabelioids
that
appear
in
these
Examples
are
strictly
coherent
[cf.
item
(T3)
of
(i)],
hence
[cf.
item
(T4)
of
(i)]
Galois-countable.
In
particular,
there
is
no
eﬀect
on
the
theory
of
objects
discussed
in
these
Examples.
(E4)
It
follows
immediately
from
(E3)
that
there
is
no
eﬀect
on
§6.
(E5)
It
follows
immediately
from
items
(T3),
(T4)
of
(i),
together
with
the
assumptions
of
ﬁniteness
and
coherence
in
the
discussion
of
the
paragraph
immediately
preceding
Deﬁnition
4.2,
the
assumption
of
coherence
in
Definition
5.1,
(i),
and
the
assumption
of
Deﬁnition
5.1,
(i),
(d),
that
there
is
no
eﬀect
on
§4,
§5.
[Here,
we
note
that
since
the
notion
of
a
tempered
covering
of
a
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
is
only
deﬁned
in
the
case
where
the
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
is
countable,
it
is
implicit
in
Proposition
5.2
and
Deﬁnition
5.3
that
the
semi-graphs
of
anabelioids
under
consideration
are
countable.]
(E6)
There
is
no
eﬀect
on
§1,
§2,
or
the
Appendix,
since
tempered
fundamental
groups
are
never
discussed
in
§1,
§2,
or
the
Appendix.
(E7)
In
the
Deﬁnitions/Propositions/Theorems/Corollaries
numbered
3.2,
3.3,
3.4,
3.5,
3.6,
3.7,
3.8,
3.9,
one
must
assume
that
all
tempered
groups,
temperoids,
and
semi-graphs
of
anabelioids
that
appear
are
Galois-countable.

SHINICHI

On
the
other
hand,
it
follows
immediately
from
(E1),
(E2),
and
(E3)
that
there
is
no
eﬀect
on
the
remaining
portions
of
§3.
(E8)
In
[QuCnf]
and
[FrdII],
one
must
assume
that
all
tempered

In

carry
out
the
argument
stated
in
the

of
Proposition
5.2,
(i),
it
is
necessary
to
strengthen
the
conditions
(c)
and
(d)
of
Deﬁnition
5.1,
(i),
as
follows.
This
strengthening
of
the
conditions
(c)

(d)
of
Deﬁnition
5.1,

has
no

either
on

Suppose
that
G
is
as
in
Deﬁnition
5.1,
(i).
Then
we
begin
by
making
the
following
observation:
(O1)
Suppose
that
G
is
ﬁnite.
Then
G
admits
a
coﬁnal,
countable
collection
of
connected
ﬁnite
étale
Galois
coverings
{G
i
→
G}i∈I
,
each
of
which
is
characteristic
[i.e.,
any
pull-back
of
the
covering
via
an
element
of
Aut(G)
is
isomorphic
to
the
original
covering].
[For
instance,
one
veriﬁes
immediately,
by
applying
the
ﬁniteness
and
coherence
of
G,
that
such
a
collection
of
coverings
may
be
obtained
by
considering,
for
n
a
positive
integer,
the
composite
of
all

ﬁnite

We

that

Suppose

The
new
version
of
the
condition
(c)
of
Deﬁnition
5.1,
(i),
that
we
wish
to
consider
is
the
following:
(cnew
)
The
action
of
H
on
G
is
trivial;
the
resulting
homomorphism
H
→
Aut(G[c]),
where
c
ranges
over
the
components
[i.e.,
vertices
and
edges]
of
G,
is
continuous
[i.e.,
relative
to
the
natural
proﬁnite
group
topology
deﬁned
in
(O2)
on
Aut(G[c])].
It
is
immediate
that
(cnew
)
implies
(c).
Moreover,
we
observe
in
passing
that:
(O3)
In
fact,
since
H
is
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated
[cf.
Deﬁnition
5.1,
(i),
(a)],
it
holds
[cf.
[NS],
Theorem
1.1]
that
every
ﬁnite
index
subgroup
of
H
is
open
in
H.
Thus,
the
conditions
(c)
and
(cnew
)
in
fact
hold
automatically.
The
new
version
of
the
condition
(d)
of
Deﬁnition
5.1,
(i),
that
we
wish
to
consider
is
the
following:
(dnew
)
There
is
a
ﬁnite
set
C
∗
of
components
[i.e.,
vertices
and
edges]
of
G
such
that
for
every
component
c
of
G,
there
exists
a
c∗
∈
C
∗
and
an
∼
isomorphism
of
semi-graphs
of
anabelioids
G[c]
→
G[c∗
]
that
is
compatible
with
the
action
of
H
on
both
sides.
It
is
immediate
that
(dnew
)
implies
(d).
The
reason
that,
in
the
context
of
the
proof
of
Proposition
5.2,
(i),
it
is
necessary
to
consider
the
stronger
conditions
(cnew
)
and
(dnew
)
is
as
follows.
It
suﬃces
to
show
that,
given
a
connected
ﬁnite
étale
covering
G

→
G,
after
possibly
replacing
H
by
an
open
subgroup
of
H,
the
action
of
H
on
G
lifts
to
an
action
on
G

that
satisﬁes
the
conditions
of
Deﬁnition
5.1,
(i).
Such
a
lifting
of
the
action
of
H
on
G
to
an
action
on
the
portion
of
G

that
lies
over
the
vertices
of
G
follows
in
a
straightforward
manner
from
the
original
conditions
(a),
(b),
(c),
and
(d).
On
the
other
hand,
in
order
to
conclude
that
such
a
lifting
is
[after
possibly
replacing
H
by
an
open
subgroup
of
H]
compatible
with
the
gluing
conditions
arising
from
the
structure
of
G

over
the
edges
of
G,
it
is
necessary
to
assume
further
that
the
“component-wise
versions
(cnew
),
(dnew
)”
of
the
original
“vertex-wise
conditions
(c),
(d)”
hold.
This
issue
is
closely
related
to
the
issue
discussed
in
(9.)
above.
(14.)
In
Deﬁnition
2.4,
(iii),
the
phrase
“underlying
graph”
should
read
“underlying
semi-graph”
(2
instances).
(15.)
In
the
ﬁrst
sentence
of
the
fourth
paragraph
of
the
discussion
entitled
“Curves”
in
§0,
the
notation
“Dg,r
⊆
Mg,r
”
should
read
“Dg,r
⊆
C
g,r
”.
