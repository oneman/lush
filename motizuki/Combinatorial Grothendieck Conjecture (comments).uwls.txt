(1.)
In
the
ﬁnal
sentence
of
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(ii),
the
phrase
“rank
≥
2”
should
read
“rank
>
2”.
(2.)
In
Example
2.5,
the
set
of
primes
Σ
should
be
assumed
to
be
nonempty.
(3.)
In
the
second
sentence
of
Proposition
1.2,
the
phrase
“a
vertex
vi
(respectively,
an
edge
ei
)
of
ΠG
”
should
read
“a
vertex
vi
(respectively,
an
edge
ei
)
of
G”.
(4.)
The
arguments
applied
in
Deﬁnition
1.4,
(v),
(vi),
and
Remarks
1.4.2,
1.4.3,
and
1.4.4
to
prove
Theorem
1.6
are
formulated
in
a
somewhat
confusing
way
and
should
be
modiﬁed
as
follows:
(i)
First
of
all,
we
remark
that
throughout
the
paper,
as
well
as
in
the
following
discussion,
a
“Galois”
ﬁnite
étale
covering
is
to
be
understood
as
being
connected.
(ii)
In
the
second
sentence
of
Deﬁnition
1.4,
(v),
the
cuspidal
and
nodal
cases
of
the
notion
of
a
purely
totally
ramiﬁed
covering
are
in
fact
unnecessary
and
may
be
deleted.
Also,
the
terminology
introduced
in
Deﬁnition
1.4,
(vi),
concerning
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
that
descend
is
unnecessary
and
may
be
deleted.
(iii)
The
text
of
Remark
1.4.2
should
be
replaced
by
the
following
text:
Let
G

→
G
be
a
Galois
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
degree
a
positive
power
of
l,
where
G
is
of
pro-Σ
PSC-type,
Σ
=
{l}.
Then
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that,
if
we
assume
further
that
the
covering
G

→
G
is
cyclic,
then
G

→
G
is
cuspidally
totally
ramiﬁed
if
and
only
if
the
inequality
r(G

)
<
l
·
r(G)
—
where
we
write
G

→
G

→
G
for
the
unique
[up
to
isomorphism]
factorization
of
the
ﬁnite
étale
covering
G

→
G
as
a
composite
of
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
such
that
G

→
G
is
of
degree
l
—
is
satisﬁed.
Suppose

further
that
G


G
is
a

necessarily
cyclic!]

deg(G

/G)
·
n(G)].
Then
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
G

→
G
is
verticially
purely
totally
ramiﬁed
if
and
only
if
the
equality
i(G

)
=
deg(G

/G)
·
(i(G)
−
1)
+
1
is
satisﬁed.
Also,
we
observe
that
this
last
inequality
is
equivalent
to
the
following
equality
involving
the
expression
“i(.
.
.
)
−
n(.
.
.
)”
[cf.
Remark
1.1.3]:
i(G

−
n(G

=

(i(G)

The
text
of
Remark
1.4.3
should
be
replaced
by
the
following
text:
Suppose
that
G
is
of
pro-Σ
PSC-type,
Σ
=
{l}.
Then
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
the
cuspidal
edge-like
subgroups
of
ΠG
may
be
characterized
as
the
maximal
[cf.
Proposition
1.2,
(i)]
closed
subgroups
A
⊆
ΠG
isomorphic
to
Zl
which
satisfy
the
following
condition:
for
every
characteristic
open
subgroup
ΠG

⊆
ΠG
,
if
we
write
G

→
G

→
G
for
the
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
corresponding
to
def
ΠG

⊆
ΠG

=
A
·
ΠG

⊆
ΠG
,
then
the
cyclic
ﬁnite
étale
covering
G

→
G

is
cuspidally
totally
ramiﬁed.
[Indeed,
the
necessity
of
this
characterization
is
immediate
from
the
definitions;
the
suﬃciency
of
this
characterization
follows
by
observing
that
since
the
set
of
cusps
of
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
G
is
always
ﬁnite,
the
above
condition
implies
that
there
exists
a
compatible
system
of
cusps
of
the
various
G

that
arise,
each
of
which
is
stabilized
by
the
action
of
A.]
On
the
other
hand,
in
order
to
characterize
the
unramiﬁed
verticial
subgroups
of
Πunr
G
,
it
suﬃces
—
by
considering
stabilizers
of
vertices
of
underlying
semi-graphs
of
ﬁnite
étale
Πunr
G
-coverings
of
G
—
to
give
a
functorial
characterization
of
the
set
of
vertices
of
G
[i.e.,
which
may
also
be
applied
to
ﬁnite
étale
Πunr
G
-coverings
of
G].
This
may
be
done,
for
sturdy
G,
as
follows.
Write
MGunr
for
the
abelianization
of
Πunr
G
.
For
each
vertex
v
of
unr
the
underlying
semi-graph
G
of
G,
write
MG
[v]
⊆
MGunr
for
the
image
of
unr
associthe
Πunr
G
-conjugacy
class
of
unramiﬁed
verticial
subgroups
of
ΠG
ated
to
v.
Then
one
veriﬁes
immediately,
by
constructing
suitable
abelian
Πunr
G
-coverings
of
G
via
suitable
gluing
operations
[i.e.,
as
in
the
proof
of
Proposition
1.2],
that
the
inclusions
MGunr
[v]
⊆
MGunr
determine
a
split
injection

MGunr
[v]
→
MGunr
v
[where
v
ranges
over
the
vertices
of
G],
whose
image
we
denote
by
MGunr-vert
⊆
MGunr
.
Now
we
consider
elementary
abelian
quotients
φ
:
MGunr

Q
—
i.e.,
where
Q
is
an
elementary
abelian
group.
We
identify
such
quotients
whenever
their
kernels
coincide
and
order
such
quotients
by
means
of
the
COMMENTS

GROTHENDIECK”

relation
of
“domination”
[i.e.,
inclusion
of
kernels].
Then
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
such
a
quotient
φ
:
MGunr

Q
corresponds
to
a
verticially
purely
totally
ramiﬁed
covering
of
G
if
and
only
if
there
exists
a
vertex
v
of
G
such
that
φ(MGunr
[v])
=
Q,
φ(MGunr
[v

])
=
0
for
all
vertices
v

=
v
of
G.
In
particular,
one
concludes
immediately
that
the
elementary
abelian
quotients
φ
:
MGunr

Q
whose
restriction
to
MGunr-vert
surjects
onto
Q
and
has
the
same
kernel
as
the
quotient
MGunr-vert

MGunr
[v]

MGunr
[v]
⊗
Fl
—
where
the
ﬁrst
“”
is
the
natural
projection;
the
second
“”
is
given
by
reduction
modulo
l
—
may
be
characterized
as
the
maximal
quotients
[i.e.,
relative
to
the
relation
of
domination]
among
those
elementary
abelian
quotients
of
MGunr
that
correspond
to
verticially
purely
totally
ramiﬁed
coverings
of
G.
Thus,
since
G
is
sturdy,
the
set
of
vertices
of
G
may
be
characterized
as
the
set
of
[nontrivial!]
quotients
MGunr-vert

MGunr
[v]
⊗
Fl
.

The
text
of
Remark
1.4.4
should
be
replaced
by
the
following
text:
Suppose
that
G
is
of
pro-Σ
PSC-type,
where
Σ
=
{l},
and
that
G
is
noncuspidal.
Then,
in
the
spirit
of
the
cuspidal
portion
of
Remark
1.4.3,
we
observe
the
following:
One
veriﬁes
immediately
that
the
nodal
edge-like
subgroups
of
ΠG
may
be
characterized
as
the
maximal
[cf.
Proposition
1.2,
(i)]
closed
subgroups
A
⊆
ΠG
isomorphic
to
Zl
which
satisfy
the
following
condition:
for
every
characteristic
open
subgroup
ΠG

⊆
ΠG
,
if
we
write
G

→
G

→
G
for
the
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
corresponding
to
def
ΠG

⊆
ΠG

=
A
·
ΠG

⊆
ΠG
,
then
the
cyclic
ﬁnite
étale
covering
G

→
G

is
nodally
totally
ramiﬁed.
Here,
we
note
further
that
[one
veriﬁes
immediately
that]
the
ﬁnite
étale
covering
G

→
G

is
nodally
totally
ramiﬁed
if
and
only
if
it
is
module-wise
nodal.
(vi)
The
text
of
the
second
paragraph
of
the
proof
of
Theorem
1.6
should
be
replaced
by
the
following
text
[which
may
be
thought
as
being
appended
to
the
end
of
the
ﬁrst
paragraph
of
the
proof
of
Theorem
1.6]:
Then
the
fact
that
α
is
group-theoretically
cuspidal
follows
formally
from
the
characterization
of
cuspidal
edge-like
subgroups
given
in
Remark
1.4.3
and
the
characterization
of
cuspidally
totally
ramiﬁed
cyclic
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
given
in
Remark
1.4.2.
(vii)
The
text
of
the
ﬁnal
paragraph
of
the
proof
of
Theorem
1.6
should
be
replaced
by
the
following
text
[which
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“easy
version”
4
SHINICHI

of
the
argument
given
in
the
proof
of
the
implication
“(iii)
=⇒
(i)”
of
[CbTpII],
Proposition
1.5]:
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
Suﬃciency
is
immediate.
On
the
other
hand,
necessity
follows
formally
from
the
characterization
of
unramiﬁed
verticial
subgroups
given
in
Remark
1.4.3
and
the
characterization
of
verticially
purely
totally
ramiﬁed
cyclic
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
given
in
Remark
1.4.2.
(5.)
In
Remarks
2.8.1,
2.8.2,
one
works
“in
the
situation
of
Corollary
2.8”,
despite
the
fact
that
the
assumption
“p
∈
Σ”
in
the
statement
of
Corollary
2.8
is
not
satisﬁed
in
the
situations
considered
in
Remarks
2.8.1,
2.8.2.
At
ﬁrst
glance,
this
state
of
aﬀairs
may
strike
the
reader
as
self-contradictory.
The
point,
however,
is
that
one
thinks
of
Corollary
2.8
as
being
applied
to
the
various
maximal
pro-l
quotients
of
open
subgroups
of
the
geometric
fundamental
groups
that
appear
in
Remark
2.8.1,
2.8.2,
i.e.,
that
one
takes
the
“Σ”
of
Corollary
2.8
to
be
{l}
for
a
suitable
prime
number
l
such
that
the
assumptions
in
the
statement
of
Corollary
2.8
are
indeed
satisﬁed.
(6.)
In
the
ﬁrst
sentence
of
the
fourth
paragraph
of
the
discussion
entitled
“Curves”
in
§0,
the
notation
“Dg,r
⊆
Mg,r
”
should
read
“Dg,r
⊆
C
g,r
”.
