TOPICS IN ABSOLUTE ANABELIAN GEOMETRY II:
DECOMPOSITION GROUPS AND ENDOMORPHISMS

October 2013
Abstract. The present paper, which forms the second part of a three-part series
in which we study absolute anabelian geometry from an algorithmic point of
view, focuses on the study of the closely related notions of decomposition groups
and endomorphisms in this anabelian context. We begin by studying an abstract
combinatorial analogue of the algebro-geometric notion of a stable polycurve [i.e., a
“successive extension of families of stable curves”] and showing that the “geometry
of log divisors on stable polycurves” may be extended, in a purely group-theoretic
fashion, to this abstract combinatorial analogue; this leads to various anabelian
results concerning conﬁguration spaces. We then turn to the study of the absolute
pro-Σ anabelian geometry of hyperbolic curves over mixed-characteristic local ﬁelds,
for Σ a set of primes of cardinality ≥ 2 that contains the residue characteristic of the
base ﬁeld. In particular, we prove a certain “pro-p resolution of nonsingularities”
type result, which implies a “conditional” anabelian result to the eﬀect that the
condition, on an isomorphism of arithmetic fundamental groups, of preservation of
decomposition groups of “most” closed points implies that the isomorphism arises
from an isomorphism of schemes — i.e., in a word, “point-theoreticity implies
geometricity”; a “non-conditional” version of this result is then obtained for “procurves” obtained by removing from a proper curve some set of closed points which
is “p-adically dense in a Galois-compatible fashion”. Finally, we study, from an
algorithmic point of view, the theory of Belyi and elliptic cuspidalizations, i.e.,
group-theoretic reconstruction algorithms for the arithmetic fundamental group of
an open subscheme of a hyperbolic curve that arise from consideration of certain
endomorphisms determined by Belyi maps and endomorphisms of elliptic curves.

a “group-theoretic algorithmic” point of view, as discussed in the Introduction
to [Mzk15]. The topics presented in the present paper center around the following
two themes:
(A) [the subgroups of arithmetic fundamental groups constituted by] decomposition groups of subvarieties of a given variety [such as closed
points, divisors] as a crucial tool that leads to absolute anabelian results;
(B) “hidden endomorphisms” — which may be thought of as “hidden
symmetries” — of hyperbolic curves that give rise to various absolute
anabelian results.
In fact, “decomposition groups” and “endomorphisms” are, in a certain sense, related notions — that is to say, the monoid of “endomorphisms” of a variety may
be thought of as a sort of “decomposition group of the generic point”!
With regard to the theme (B), we recall that the endomorphisms of an abelian
variety play a fundamental role in the theory of abelian varieties [e.g., elliptic
curves!]. Unlike abelian varieties, hyperbolic curves [say, in characteristic zero]
do not have suﬃcient “endomorphisms” in the literal, scheme-theoretic sense to
form the basis for an interesting theory. This diﬀerence between abelian varieties
and hyperbolic curves may be thought of, at a certain level, as reﬂecting the difference between linear Euclidean geometries and non-linear hyperbolic geometries.
From this point of view, it is natural to search for “hidden endomorphisms” that
are, in some way, related to the intrinsic non-linear hyperbolic geometry of a hyperbolic curve. Examples [that appear in previous papers of the author] of such
“hidden endomorphisms” — which exhibit a remarkable tendency to be related [for
instance, via some induced action on the arithmetic fundamental group] to some
sort of “anabelian result” — are the following:
(i) the interpretation of the automorphism group P SL2 (R) of the universal covering of a hyperbolic Riemann surface as an object that gives
rise to a certain “Grothendieck Conjecture-type result” in the “geometry
of categories” [cf. [Mzk11], Theorem 1.12];
(ii) the interpretation of the theory of Teichmüller mappings [a sort of
endomorphism — cf. (iii) below] between hyperbolic Riemann surfaces as
a “Grothendieck Conjecture-type result” in the “geometry of categories”
[cf. [Mzk11], Theorem 2.3];
(iii) the use of the endomorphisms constituted by Frobenius liftings — in
the form of p-adic Teichmüller theory — to obtain the absolute anabelian
result constituted by [Mzk6], Corollary 3.8;
(iv) the use of the endomorphism rings of Lubin-Tate groups to obtain the
absolute anabelian result constituted by [Mzk15], Corollaries 3.8, 3.9.
The main results of the present paper — in which both themes (A) and (B)
play a central role — are the following:
(1) In §1, we develop a purely combinatorial approach to the algebro-geometric
notion of a stable polycurve [cf. [Mzk2], Deﬁnition 4.5]. This approach may

TOPICS IN ABSOLUTE ANABELIAN GEOMETRY II

be thought of as being motivated by the purely combinatorial approach to
the notion of a stable curve given in [Mzk13]. Moreover, in §1, we apply
the theory of [Mzk13] to give, in eﬀect, “group-theoretic algorithms”
for reconstructing the “abstract combinatorial analogue” of the geometry of the various divisors — in the form of inertia and decomposition
groups — associated to the canonical log structure of a stable polycurve
[cf. Theorem 1.7]. These techniques, together with the theory of [MT],
give rise to
various relative and absolute anabelian results concerning
conﬁguration spaces associated to hyperbolic curves
[cf. Corollaries 1.10, 1.11]. Relative to the discussion above of “hidden endomorphisms”, we observe that such conﬁguration spaces may be thought
of as representing a sort of “tautological endomorphism/correspondence”
of the hyperbolic curve in question.
(2) In §2, we study the absolute pro-Σ anabelian geometry of hyperbolic
curves over mixed-characteristic local ﬁelds, for Σ a set of primes of cardinality ≥ 2 that contains the residue characteristic of the base ﬁeld. In
particular, we show that the condition, on an isomorphism of arithmetic
fundamental groups, of preservation of decomposition groups of “most”
closed points implies that the isomorphism arises from an isomorphism of
schemes — i.e., in a word,
“point-theoreticity implies geometricity”
[cf. Corollary 2.9]. This condition may be removed if one works with “procurves” obtained by removing from a proper curve some set of closed points
which is “p-adically dense in a Galois-compatible fashion” [cf. Corollary
2.10]. The key technical result that underlies these anabelian results is a
certain “pro-p resolution of nonsingularities” type result [cf. Lemma
2.6; Remark 2.6.1; Corollary 2.11] — i.e., a result reminiscent of the main
[proﬁnite] results of [Tama2]. This technical result allows one to apply
the theory of uniformly toral neighborhoods developed in [Mzk15],
§3. Relative to the discussion above of “hidden endomorphisms”, this
technical result is interesting [cf., e.g., (iii) above] in that one central
step of the proof of the technical result is quite similar to the well-known
classical argument that implies the nonexistence of a Frobenius lifting
for stable curves over the ring of Witt vectors of a ﬁnite ﬁeld [cf. Remark
2.6.2].
(3) In §3, we re-examine the theory of [Mzk8], §2, for reconstructing the
decomposition groups of closed points from the point of view of the present
series of developing “group-theoretic algorithms”. In particular, we observe
that these group-theoretic algorithms allow one to use
Belyi maps and endomorphisms of elliptic curves to construct [not only decomposition groups of closed points, but also]
“cuspidalizations”

[i.e., the full arithmetic fundamental groups of the open subschemes obtained by removing various closed points — cf. the theory of [Mzk14]] associated to various types of closed points [cf. Corollaries 3.3, 3.4, 3.7, 3.8].
Relative to the discussion above of “hidden endomorphisms”, the theory
of Belyi and elliptic cuspidalizations given in §3 illustrates quite explicitly
how endomorphisms [arising from Belyi maps or endomorphisms of elliptic
curves] can give rise to group-theoretic reconstruction algorithms.
Finally, we remark that although the “algorithmic approach” to stating anabelian
results is not carried out very explicitly in §1, §2 [by comparison to §3 or [Mzk15]],
the translation into “algorithmic language” of the more traditional “Grothendieck
Conjecture-type” statements of the main results of §1, §2 is quite routine. [Here,
it should be noted that the results of §1 that depend on “Uchida’s theorem” —
i.e., Theorem 1.8, (ii); Corollary 1.11, (iv) — constitute a notatable exception to
this “remark”, an exception that will be discussed in more detail in [Mzk16] — cf.,
e.g., [Mzk16], Remark 1.9.5.] That is to say, this translation was not carried out
explicitly by the author solely because of the complexity of the algorithms implicit
in §1, §2, i.e., not as a result of any substantive mathematical obstacles.

Section 0: Notations and Conventions
We shall continue to use the “Notations and Conventions” of [Mzk15], §0. In
addition, we shall use the following notation and conventions:
Topological Groups:
Let G be a topologically ﬁnitely generated, slim proﬁnite group. Thus, G admits
a basis of characteristic open subgroups. Any such basis determines a proﬁnite
topology on the groups Aut(G), Out(G). If ρ : H → Out(G) is any continuous
homomorphism of proﬁnite groups, then we denote by
out

G  H
the proﬁnite group obtained by pulling back the natural exact sequence of proﬁnite
groups 1 → G → Aut(G) → Out(G) → 1 via ρ. Thus, we have a natural exact
out

sequence of proﬁnite groups 1 → G → G  H → H → 1.
Semi-graphs:
Let Γ be a connected semi-graph [cf., e.g., [Mzk9], §1, for a review of the theory
of semi-graphs]. We shall refer to the [possibly inﬁnite] dimension over Q of the
singular homology module H1 (Γ, Q) as the loop-rank lp-rk(Γ) of Γ. We shall say
that Γ is loop-ample if, for any edge e of Γ, the semi-graph obtained from Γ by
removing e remains connected. We shall say that Γ is untangled if every closed
edge of Γ abuts to two distinct vertices [cf. [Mzk9], §1]. We shall say that Γ is
edge-paired (respectively, edge-even) if Γ is untangled, and, moreover, for any two
[not necessarily distinct!] vertices v, v  of Γ, the set of edges e of Γ such that e
abuts to a vertex w of Γ if and only if w ∈ {v, v  } is either empty or of cardinality
≥ 2 (respectively, empty or of even cardinality). [Thus, one veriﬁes immediately
that if Γ is edge-paired (respectively, edge-even), then it is loop-ample (respectively,
edge-paired).] We shall refer to as a simple path in Γ any connected subgraph γ ⊆ Γ
such that the following conditions are satisﬁed: (a) γ is a ﬁnite tree that has at least
one edge; (b) given any vertex v of γ, there exist at most two branches of edges of
γ that abut to v. Thus, [one veriﬁes easily that] a simple path γ has precisely two
vertices v such that there exists precisely one branch of an edge of γ that abuts to
v; we shall refer to these two vertices as the terminal vertices of the simple path γ.
If γ, γ  are simple paths in Γ such that the terminal vertices of γ, γ  coincide, then
we shall say that γ, γ  are co-terminal.
Log Schemes:
We shall often regard a scheme as a log scheme equipped the trivial log structure. Any ﬁber product of fs [i.e., ﬁne, saturated] log schemes is to be taken in the
category of fs log schemes. In particular, the underlying scheme of such a product
is ﬁnite over, but not necessarily isomorphic to, the ﬁber product of the underlying
schemes.

Curves:
We shall refer to a hyperbolic orbicurve X as semi-elliptic [i.e., “of type (1, 1)± ”
in the terminology of [Mzk12], §0] if there exists a ﬁnite étale double covering
Y → X, where Y is a once-punctured elliptic curve, and the covering is given by
the stack-theoretic quotient of Y by the “action of ±1” [i.e., relative to the group
operation on the elliptic curve given by the canonical compactiﬁcation of Y ].
For i = 1, 2, let Xi be a hyperbolic orbicurve over a ﬁeld ki . Then we shall say
that X1 , X2 are isogenous [cf. [Mzk14], §0] if there exists a hyperbolic orbicurve
X over a ﬁeld k, together with ﬁnite étale morphisms X → Xi , for i = 1, 2. Note
that in this situation, the morphisms X → Xi induce ﬁnite separable inclusions of
ﬁelds ki → k. [Indeed, this follows immediately
 from the easily veriﬁed fact that
×
every subgroup G ⊆ Γ(X, OX ) such that G {0} determines a ﬁeld is necessarily
contained in k × .]
We shall use the term stable log curve as it was deﬁned in [Mzk9], §0. Let
X log → S log
be a stable log curve over an fs log scheme S log , where S = Spec(k) for some ﬁeld
k; k a separable closure of k. Then we shall refer to as the loop-rank lp-rk(X log ) [or
lp-rk(X)] of X log [or X] the loop-rank of the dual graph of X log ×k k [or X ×k k].
We shall say that X log [or X] is loop-ample (respectively, untangled; edge-paired;
edge-even) if the dual semi-graph with compact structure [cf. [Mzk5], Appendix]
of X log ×k k is loop-ample (respectively, untangled; edge-paired; edge-even) [as a
connected semi-graph]. We shall say that X log [or X] is sturdy if the normalization
of every irreducible component of X is of genus ≥ 2 [cf. [Mzk13], Remark 1.1.5].
Observe that for any prime number l invertible on S, there exist an fs log
scheme T log over S log , where T = Spec(k  ), for some ﬁnite separable extension k 
of k, and a connected Galois log admissible covering Y log → X log ×S log T log [cf.
[Mzk1], §3] of degree a power of l such that Y log is sturdy and edge-paired [hence,
in particular, untangled and loop-ample]; if, moreover, l = 2, then one may also
take Y log to be edge-even. [Indeed, to verify this observation, we may assume
that k = k. Then note that any hyperbolic curve U over k admits a connected
ﬁnite étale Galois covering V → U of degree a power of l such that V is of genus
≥ 2 and ramiﬁed with ramiﬁcation index l2 at each of the cusps of V — cf. the
discussion at the end of the present §0. Thus, by gluing together such coverings at
the nodes of X, one concludes that there exists a connected Galois log admissible
covering Z1log → X log ×S log T log of degree a power of l which is totally ramiﬁed over
every node of X with ramiﬁcation index l2 such that every irreducible component
of Z1 is of genus ≥ 2 — i.e., Z1log is sturdy. Next, observe that there exists a
connected Galois log admissible covering Z2log → Z1log of degree a power of l that
arises from a covering of the dual graph of Z1 such that Z2log is untangled [and
still sturdy]. Finally, observe that there exists a connected Galois log admissible
covering Z3log → Z2log of degree a positive power of l which restricts to a connected
ﬁnite étale covering over every irreducible component of Z2 [hence is unramiﬁed at
the nodes] such that Z3log is edge-paired [and still sturdy and untangled] for arbitrary
def

l and edge-even when l = 2. Thus, we may take Y log = Z3log .]

Observe that if X is loop-ample, then for every point x ∈ X(k) which is not
a unique cusp of X [i.e., either x is not a cusp or if x is a cusp, then it is not the
unique cusp of X], the evaluation map
H 0 (X, ωX log /S log ) → ωX log /S log |x
is surjective. Indeed, by considering the long exact sequence associated to the short
exact sequence 0 → ωX log /S log ⊗OX Ix → ωX log /S log → ωX log /S log |x → 0, where
Ix ⊆ OX is the sheaf of ideals corresponding to x, one veriﬁes immediately that it
suﬃces to show that the surjection
def

def

Hx = H 1 (X, ωX log /S log ⊗OX Ix )  H = H 1 (X, ωX log /S log )
is injective. If x is a node, then the fact that X is loop-ample implies [by computing
via Serre duality] that either dimk (Hx ) = dimk (H) = 1 [if X has no cusps] or
dimk (Hx ) = dimk (H) = 0 [if X has cusps]. Thus, we may assume that x is not a
node, so the surjection Hx  H is dual to the injection
def

def

M = H 0 (X, OX (−D)) → Mx = H 0 (X, OX (x − D))

def

(⊆ Nx = H 0 (X, OX (x)))

— where we write D ⊆ X for the divisor of cusps of X. If x is a cusp, then it follows
that D is of degree ≥ 2, and one computes easily that dimk (M) = dimk (Mx ) = 0.
Thus, we may assume that x is not a cusp. Write C for the irreducible component
of X containing x. Now suppose that the injection M → Mx is not surjective.
Then it follows that dimk (Nx ) = 2, and that Nx determines a basepoint-free linear
system on X. In particular, Nx determines a morphism φ : X → P1k that is of
∼
degree 1 on C — i.e., determines an isomorphism C → P1k — and constant on the
other irreducible components of X. Since X is loop-ample, it follows that the dual
graph Γ of X either has no edges or admits a loop containing the vertex determined
by C. On the other hand, the existence of such a loop contradicts the fact that φ
∼
determines an isomorphism C → P1k . Thus, we conclude that X = C ∼
= P1k , so D is
of degree ≥ 3. But this implies that Mx = 0, a contradiction.
Finally, let U be a hyperbolic curve over an algebraically closed ﬁeld k and l a
prime number invertible in k. Suppose that the cardinality r of the set of cusps of
U is ≥ 2, and, moreover, that, if l = 2, then r is even. Then observe that it follows
immediately from the well-known structure of the maximal pro-l quotient of the
abelianization of the étale fundamental group of U that
for every power ln of l, where n is a positive integer, there exists a cyclic
covering V → U of degree ln that is totally ramiﬁed over the cusps of U .
Indeed, this observation is an immediate consequence of the elementary fact that,
in light of our assumptions on r, there always exist r − 1 integers prime to l whose
sum is also prime to l. We shall often make use of the assumption that a stable
log curve is edge-paired — or, when l = 2, edge-even — by applying the above
observation to the various connected components of the complement of the cusps
and nodes of the stable log curve.

Section 1: A Combinatorial Analogue of Stable Polycurves
In the present §1, we apply the theory of [Mzk13] to study a sort of purely
group-theoretic, combinatorial analogue [cf. Deﬁnition 1.5 below] of the notion of a
stable polycurve introduced in [Mzk2], Deﬁnition 4.5. This allows one to reconstruct
the “abstract combinatorial analogue” of the “geometry of log divisors” [i.e., divisors
associated to the log structure of a stable polycurve] of such a combinatorial object
via group theory [cf. Theorem 1.7]. Finally, we apply the theory of [MT] to obtain
various consequences of the theory of the present §1 [cf. Corollaries 1.10, 1.11]
concerning the absolute anabelian geometry of conﬁguration spaces.
We begin by recalling the discussion of [Mzk13], Example 2.5.
Example 1.1.

Stable Log Curves over a Logarithmic Point (Revisited).

(i) Let k be a separably closed ﬁeld; Σ a nonempty set of prime numbers invertible in k; M ⊆ Q the monoid of positive rational numbers with denominators invertible in k; S log (respectively, T log ) the log scheme obtained by equipping
def

def

S = Spec(k) (respectively, T = Spec(k)) with the log structure determined by the
chart N  1 → 0 ∈ k (respectively, M  1 → 0 ∈ k); T log → S log the morphism
determined by the natural inclusion N → M;
X log → S log
def

a stable log curve over S log . Thus, the proﬁnite group IS log = Aut(T log /S log )
∼
admits a natural isomorphism IS log → Hom(Q/Z, k × ) and ﬁts into an natural exact
sequence
def

def

1 → ΔX log = π1 (X log ×S log T log ) → ΠX log = π1 (X log ) → IS log → 1
— where we write “π1 (−)” for the “log fundamental group” of the log scheme in
parentheses [which amounts, in this case, to the fundamental group arising from
the admissible coverings of X log ], relative to an appropriate choice of basepoint [cf.
[Ill] for a survey of the theory of log fundamental groups]. In particular, if we write
ISΣlog for the maximal pro-Σ quotient of IS log , then as abstract proﬁnite groups,
 Σ , where we write Z
 Σ for the maximal pro-Σ quotient of Z.

ISΣlog ∼
=Z
(ii) On the other hand, X log determines a semi-graph of anabelioids [cf. [Mzk9],
Deﬁnition 2.1] of pro-Σ PSC-type [cf. [Mzk13], Deﬁnition 1.1, (i)], whose underlying
semi-graph we denote by G. Thus, for each vertex v [corresponding to an irreducible
component of X log ] (respectively, edge e [corresponding to a node or cusp of X log ])
of G, we have a connected anabelioid [i.e., a Galois category] Gv (respectively, Ge ),
and for each branch b of an edge e abutting to a vertex v, we are given a morphism
of anabelioids Ge → Gv . Then the maximal pro-Σ completion of ΔX log may be
identiﬁed with the “PSC-fundamental group” ΠG associated to G. Also, we recall
that ΠG is slim [cf., e.g., [Mzk13], Remark 1.1.3], and that the groups Aut(G),
Out(ΠG ) may be equipped with proﬁnite topologies in such a way that the natural
morphism
Aut(G) → Out(ΠG )

TOPICS IN ABSOLUTE ANABELIAN GEOMETRY II

is a continuous injection [cf. the discussion at the beginning of [Mzk13], §2], which
we shall use to identify Aut(G) with its image in Out(ΠG ). In particular, we obtain
a natural continuous homomorphism IS log → Aut(G). Moreover, it follows immediately from the well-known structure of admissible coverings at nodes [cf., e.g.,
[Mzk1], §3.23] that this homomorphism factors through ISΣlog , hence determines a
natural continuous homomorphism ρI : ISΣlog → Aut(G). Also, we recall that each
vertex v (respectively, edge e) of G determines a(n) verticial subgroup Πv ⊆ ΠG
(respectively, edge-like subgroup Πe ⊆ ΠG ), which is well-deﬁned up to conjugation
— cf. [Mzk13], Deﬁnition 1.1, (ii). Here, the edge-like subgroups Πe may be either
nodal or cuspidal, depending on whether e corresponds to a node or to a cusp. If
an edge e corresponds to a node (respectively, cusp), then we shall simply say that
e “is” a node (respectively, cusp).
(iii) Let e be a node of X. Write Me for the stalk of the characteristic sheaf
of the log scheme X log at e; MS for the stalk of the characteristic sheaf of the
log scheme S log at the tautological S-valued point of S. Thus, MS ∼
= N; we have
a natural inclusion MS → Me , with respect to which we shall often [by abuse of
notation] identify MS with its image in Me . Write σ ∈ Me for the unique generator
of [the image of] MS . Then there exist elements ξ, η ∈ Me satisfying the relation
ξ + η = ie · σ
for some positive integer ie , which we shall refer to as the index of the node e, such
that Me is generated by ξ, η, σ. Also, we shall write iΣ
e for the largest positive
integer j such that ie /j is a product of primes ∈ Σ and refer to iΣ
e as the Σ-index
of the node e. One veriﬁes easily that the set of elements {ξ, η} of Me may be
characterized intrisically as the set of elements θ ∈ Me \MS such that any relation
θ = n · θ + θ for n a positive integer, θ ∈ Me \MS , θ ∈ MS implies that n = 1,
θ = 0. In particular, ie , iΣ
e are well-deﬁned and depend only on the isomorphism
class of the pair consisting of the monoid Me and the submonoid ⊆ Me given by
the image of MS .
Remark 1.1.1. Of course, in Example 1.1, it is not necessary to assume that k
is separably closed [cf. [Mzk13], Example 2.5]. If k is not separably closed, then
one must also contend with the action of the absolute Galois group of k. More
generally, for the theory of the present §1, it is not even necessary to assume that
an “additional proﬁnite group” acting on G arises “from scheme theory”. It is this
point of view that formed the motivation for Deﬁnition 1.2 below.
Deﬁnition 1.2.

In the notation of Example 1.1:

(i) Let ρH : H → Aut(G) (⊆ Out(ΠG )) be a continuous homomorphism of
proﬁnite groups; suppose that X log is nonsingular [i.e., has no nodes]. Then we
shall refer to as a [pro-Σ] PSC-extension [i.e., “pointed stable curve extension”]
any extension of proﬁnite groups that is isomorphic — via an isomorphism which
we shall refer to as the “structure of [pro-Σ] PSC-extension” — to an extension of

construction data that may be derived from the original construction data. On
the other hand, in the situation of Deﬁnition 1.2, (ii), given an open subgroup of
ΠI [equipped with the induced extension structure], in order to endow this open
subgroup with a structure of IPSC-extension, it may be necessary — even if, for
instance, this open subgroup of ΠI surjects onto I — to replace the inertia subgroup
I of H by some open subgroup of I [i.e., in eﬀect, to replace the given open subgroup
of ΠI with the intersection of this given open subgroup with the inverse image in
ΠI of some open subgroup of I]. Such replacements may be regarded as a sort of
abstract group-theoretic analogue of the operation of passing to a ﬁnite extension of
a discretely valued ﬁeld in order to achieve a situation in which a given hyperbolic
curve over the original ﬁeld has stable reduction.
Remark 1.2.2.
Note that in the situation of Deﬁnition 1.2, (ii), the inertia
subgroup I ⊆ H is not intrinsically determined in the sense that any open subgroup
of I may also serve as the inertia subgroup of H — cf. the replacement operation
discussed in Remark 1.2.1.
Remark 1.2.3. Recall that for l ∈ Σ, one may construct directly from G a pro-l
cyclotomic character χl : Aut(G) → Z×
l [cf. [Mzk13], Lemma 2.1]. In particular,
any ρH as in Deﬁnition 1.2, (i), (ii), determines a pro-l cyclotomic character χl |H :
H → Z×
l . The action ρH is called l-cyclotomically full [cf. [Mzk13], Deﬁnition
2.3, (ii)] if the image of χl |H is open. We shall also apply this terminology “lcyclotomically full” to the corresponding PSC-, DPSC-extensions. In fact, it follows
immediately from the ﬁrst portion of [Mzk13], Proposition 2.4, (iv), that the issue of
whether or not ρH is l-cyclotomically full depends only on the outer representation
H → Out(ΠG ) of H on ΠG determined by ρH .

we have inclusions Iv , Iv ⊆ Ie , and the natural morphism Iv × Iv → Ie is an open

(iv) Let v, v  be vertices of G. If Dv Dv ΠI = {1}, then one of the

(v) Let v be a vertex of G. Then Dv = CΠH (Iv ) = NΠH (Iv ) is commensurably terminal in ΠH ; Dv Π

two [mutually exclusive] properties holds: (1)
 e =

situation of (2), [for appropriate choices of conjugates

of the various inertia and
decomposition groups involved] we have Iv = De De ΠI .
(ix) Let e be an edge of G. Then the image of De in H is open, but De is
not open in ΠH .
(x) Let τI : I → ΠI be the [outer] homomorphism that arises [by functoriality!]
from a “log point” τS ∈ X log (S log ). Let us call τI non-verticial (respectively,
non-edge-like) if τI (I) is not contained in Iv (respectively, Ie ) for any vertex
v (respectively, edge e) of G. Then if τI is non-verticial and non-edge-like, then
the image of τS is the unique cusp eτ of X such that [for an appropriate choice
of conjugate of Deτ ] τI (I) ⊆ Deτ . Now suppose that the image of τS is not a
cusp. Then τI satisﬁes the condition τI (I) = Ivτ for some vertex vτ of G [and an
appropriate choice of conjugate of Ivτ ] if and only if the image of τS is a non-nodal
point of the irreducible component of X corresponding to vτ ; τI is non-verticial and
satisﬁes the condition τI (I) ⊆ Ieτ for some node eτ of G [and an appropriate choice
of conjugate of Ieτ ] if and only if the image of τS is the node of X corresponding
to eτ .
Proof. Assertion (i) follows immediately from the deﬁnitions. Next, we consider
assertion (ii). Write ν (∼
= S) for the closed subscheme of X determined by the node
of X corresponding to e; ν log for the result of equipping ν with the log structure
def
pulled back from X log . Thus, we obtain a natural [outer] homomorphism Πν =
π1 (ν log ) → π1 (X log ) = ΠX log  ΠI . Now [in the notation of Example 1.1, (iii)] one
computes easily [by considering the Galois groups of the various Kummer log étale

 Σ , and one veriﬁes immediately [from the deﬁnition
Hom(Megp /MS ⊗ Q/Z, k × ) ⊗ Z
of G] that this kernel maps isomorphically onto Πe ⊆ ΠI . In particular, it follows
that we obtain an injection ΠΣ
ν → ΠI whose image contains Πe and surjects onto I.
Σ
it follows that the image Im(ΠΣ
Since Πν is abelian,
ν ) of this injection is contained

in Ie ; since Ie ΠG = Πe [cf. [Mzk13], Proposition 1.2, (ii)], we thus conclude that
Im(ΠΣ
ν ) = Ie . Now it follows immediately from the deﬁnitions that Iv , Iv  ⊆ Ie ;
moreover, one computes immediately that [in the notation of Example 1.1, (iii)] the
Σ
subgroups Iv , Iv ⊆ Ie correspond to the subgroups of Hom(Megp ⊗ Q/Z, k × ) ⊗ Z
consisting of homomorphisms that vanish on ξ, η, respectively. Now the various
assertions contained in the statement of assertion (ii) follow immediately. This
completes the proof of assertion (ii).

Next, we consider assertion (iii). Since Πv is slim [cf., e.g., [Mzk13], Remark
1.1.3] and commensurably
terminal in ΠG [cf. [Mzk13], Proposition 1.2, (ii)], it

follows that Dv ΠG = Πv and Iv ΠG = {1}, so we obtain a natural injection
Iv → I. The fact that this injection is, in fact, surjective is immediate from the
deﬁnitions when X is smooth over k and follows from the computation of “Iv ”
performed in the proof of assertion (ii) when X is singular. Next, let us observe
[by deﬁnition!] with Πv , we 
obtain a natural morphism
that since Iv commutes

Iv × Πv → Dv ΠI , which is both injective [since Iv Πv = {1}] and surjective

∼
[cf. the isomorphism Iv → I; the fact that Dv ΠG = Πv ]. Now suppose that e
is a cusp that abuts to v. Then [for appropriate choices of conjugates]
it follows

Π


Ie commutes with Iv . Note, moreover, that De ΠG = Ie [cf. [Mzk13], Proposition
1.2, (ii)]. Thus, the fact that the natural projection Iv → I is an isomorphism
implies that we have a natural exact sequence
1 → Ie → De ΠI → I → 1, and

that the natural morphism Ie × Iv → De ΠI is an isomorphism. This completes
the proof of assertion (iii).

Next, we consider assertion (vii). Since De ΠG = Πe [cf. [Mzk13], Proposition 1.2, (ii)], it follows that De ⊆ CΠH (De ) ⊆ CΠH (Πe ); on the other hand, by
[Mzk13], Proposition 1.2, (i), it follows that CΠH (Πe ) = NΠH (Πe ) (= De ); thus,
De = CΠH (De ) = CΠH (Πe ) = NΠH (Πe ), as desired. Now it remains only to consider the case where e is a node. In this case, since
 Ie is abelian [cf. assertion (ii)],
it followsthat Ie ⊆ ZΠI (Ie ) ⊆ CΠI (Ie ) ⊆ CΠI (Ie ΠG ) = CΠI (Πe ); thus, the fact
that De ΠI = CΠI (Πe ) = CΠI (Ie ) = Ie follows from the fact that Ie surjects onto
I [cf. assertion (ii)], together with the commensurable terminality of Πe in ΠG [cf.
[Mzk13], Proposition 1.2, (ii)]. This completes the proof of assertion (vii).
Next, we consider assertion (iv). Suppose that (2) holds. Then it follows
from assertions (ii), (iii) [and the deﬁnitions] that Iv Iv = {1}, Ie = Πe · Iv =

Πe · Iv ⊆ Dv Dv ΠI ⊆ ZΠI (Iv × Iv ) ⊆ CΠI (Ie ). On theotherhand, by
assertion (vii), we have CΠI (Ie ) = Ie . But
 this implies that Dv Dv ΠI = Ie .
Next, suppose that (3) holds, and that Πv Πv = {1}. Then it follows immediately
from our discussion of the situation in which (2) holds [cf. also assertion (iii)] that

Iv Iv = {1}. Thus, to complete the proof of assertion (iv), it suﬃces to verify
— under
the

 assumption
 that (1) and (2) are false! — that we have an equality
(Dv Dv ΠI ⊇) Πv Πv = {1}, and that (3) holds.
Write Cv , Cv for the irreducible components of X corresponding to v, v  .
Suppose that both (1) and (2) are false. Recall that ΠG [cf. [MT], Remark 1.2.2]
 Σ ), hence also ΠI , are torsion-free. Thus, Iv × Πv = Dv  ΠI [cf.
and I (∼
= Z
assertion (iii)] is torsion-free, so by replacing ΠH by an open subgroup of ΠH [cf.
Remark 1.2.1], we may assume without loss of generality that G [i.e., X log ] is sturdy
[cf. §0], and that G is edge-paired [cf. §0]. Also, by projecting to the maximal
pro-l quotients, for some l ∈ Σ, of suitable open subgroups [cf. Remark 1.2.1] of
the various pro-Σ groups involved, one veriﬁes immediately that we may assume
without loss of generality [for the remainder of the proof of assertion (iv)] that
Σ = {l}. When l = 2, we may also assume without loss of generality [by replacing
ΠH by an open subgroup of ΠH ] that G is edge-even [cf. §0].



Now I claim that Dv Dv ΠG = Πv Πv = {1}. Indeed, suppose that
Πv Πv = {1}. Then one veriﬁes immediately that there exist log admissible
coverings [cf. [Mzk1], §3] Y log → X log ×S log T log , corresponding

to open subgroups


J ⊆ ΠG , which are split over Cv [so
 Πv ⊆ J, Πv Πv ⊆ Πv J], but determine
arbitrarily small neighborhoods Πv J of the identity element in Πv . [Here, we
note that the existence of such coverings follows immediately from the fact that
X log is edge-paired for arbitrary l and edge-even when l = 2. That is to say, one
starts by constructing the covering over Cv in such a way that the ramiﬁcation
indices at the nodes and cusps of Cv are all equal; one then extends the covering
over the irreducible components of X adjacent to v [by applying the fact that X log
is edge-paired for arbitrary l and edge-even when l = 2 — cf. the discussion of §0]
in such a way that the covering is unramiﬁed over the nodes of these irreducible
components that do not abut to Cv ; ﬁnally, one extends the covering to a split
covering over the remaining
 portion of X [which includes Cv !].] But the existence
of such J implies that Πv Πv = {1}, a contradiction.

 This completes the proof
of the claim. Thus, the natural projection Dv Dv ΠI → I has nontrivial open
image [since Σ = {l}], which we denote by Iv,v ⊆ I. Moreover, to complete the
proof of assertion (iv), it suﬃces to derive a contradiction under the assumption
that (1), (2), and (3) are false. Thus, for the remainder of the proof of assertion
(iv), we assume that (1), (2), and (3) are false.
Write Cv+ ⊆ X for the union of Cv and the irreducible components of X that
are adjacent to Cv . We shall refer to a vertex of G as a Cv+ -vertex if it corresponds
to an irreducible component of Cv+ . We shall say that a node e is a bridge node
if it abuts both to a Cv+ -vertex and to a non-Cv+ -vertex. Thus, no bridge node
abuts to v. Now let us write iv for the least common multiple of the indices ie
of the bridge nodes e; iΣ
v for the largest nonnegative power of l dividing iv . Let

To this end, let us ﬁrst observe that the characteristic sheaf of the log scheme
X log admits a section ζ over X satisfying the following properties:
(a) ζ vanishes on the open subscheme of X given by the complement of Cv+
[hence, in particular, on Cv ];
(b) ζ coincides with iv · σ ∈ MS [cf. the notation of Example 1.1, (iii)] at
the generic points of Cv+ ;
(c) ζ coincides with either (iv /ie )·ξ ∈ Me or (iv /ie )·η ∈ Me [cf. the notation
of Example 1.1, (iii)] at each bridge node e.
[Indeed, the existence of such a section ζ follows immediately from the discussion of
Example 1.1, (iii), together with our deﬁnition of iv .] Thus, by taking the inverse
image of ζ in the monoid that deﬁnes the log structure of X log , we obtain a line
bundle L on X. Let Y → X be a ﬁnite étale cyclic covering of order a positive
power of l such that L|Y has degree divisible by dΣ on every irreducible component
of Y , and Y → X restricts to a connected covering over every irreducible component

of X that is = Cv [e.g., Cv ], but splits over Cv ; Y log = X log ×X Y ; Cw = Cv ×X Y ;

= Cv+ ×X Y . [Note that the fact that such a covering exists follows immediately
Cw
from our assumption that G is sturdy.] Now let

Z log → Y log
be a log étale cyclic covering of degree dΣ satisfying the following properties:
(d) Z log → Y log restricts to an étale covering of schemes over the complement
+
and splits over the irreducible components of Y that lie over Cv
of Cw
[cf. (a); the fact that (1), (2), and (3) are assumed to be false!];
(e) Z log → Y log is ramiﬁed, with ramiﬁcation index dΣ /iΣ

[cf. (b)];
(f) for each node f of Y that lies over a bridge node e of X, the restriction
of Z log → Y log to the branch of f that does not abut to an irreducible

is ramiﬁed, with ramiﬁcation index dΣ · iΣ
component of Cw
e /iv [cf. (c)].
Indeed, to construct such a covering Z log → Y log , it suﬃces to construct a covering

[which is always possible, by the
satisfying (d), (f) over the complement of Cw
conditions imposed on Y , together with the fact that (1), (2), and (3) are assumed

[since dΣ = l · iΣ

completes the proof of assertion (iv).
Next, we consider assertion (v). First, let us observe that it follows from
assertion (iv) [i.e., by applying assertion (iv) to various
open subgroups of ΠH , ΠI

(γ · Iv · γ −1 ) = {1}, then Πv =

γ · Πv · γ −1 . Thus, we conclude that NΠH (Iv ) ⊆ CΠH (Iv ) ⊆ NΠH (Πv ) = Dv . On
the other hand, since [by deﬁnition] Iv = ZΠI (Πv ), and I is normal in H, it follows
(Πv ) ⊆ NΠH (Iv ), so NΠH (Iv ) = CΠH (Iv ) = Dv , as desired.
In
that Dv = NΠ
H

particular, Dv ΠI = NΠI (Iv ) = CΠI (Iv ). Next, let us observe that Dv ΠG = Πv
[cf. [Mzk13], Proposition 1.2, (ii)]. Thus, Dv ⊆ CΠH (Dv ) ⊆ CΠH (Πv ). Moreover,
by [Mzk13], Proposition 1.2, (i), it follows
thatCΠH (Πv ) = NΠH (Πv ) = Dv ; thus,

we conclude that Dv (respectively, Dv ΠI ; Dv ΠG ) is commensurably

assertion (iii), we have Dv ΠI = Iv × Πv ⊆
ΠH (respectively, ΠI ; ΠG ).Finally, by 
ZΠI (Iv ) ⊆ NΠI (Iv ) = Dv ΠI , so Dv ΠI = ZΠI (Iv ), as desired. This completes
the proof of assertion (v).
Next, we consider assertion (vi). The fact that the image of Dv in H is open
follows immediately from the fact that since the semi-graph G is ﬁnite, some open
subgroupof H necessarily ﬁxes v. On the other hand, if G admits a vertexv  = v,
then Πv Πv is not open in Πv [cf. [Mzk13], Proposition 1.2, (i)]; since Dv ΠG =
Πv [cf. [Mzk13], Proposition 1.2, (ii)], this implies that Dv is not open in ΠH . This
completes the proof of assertion (vi).
Next, we consider assertion (viii). First, we observe that if property (2) holds,

hence also De De ΠI , is torsion-free, by projecting to the maximal pro-l quotients, for some l ∈ Σ, of suitable open subgroups [cf. Remark 1.2.1] of the various pro-Σ groups involved, one veriﬁes immediately we may assume without loss

of assertion (viii),
it suﬃces to derive a contradiction under the further assump
tion that De De ΠG = {1}, and e and e do not abut to a common vertex.
Moreover, by replacing ΠH by an open subgroup of ΠH [cf. Remark 1.2.1], we may

assume without loss of generality that G [i.e., X log ] is sturdy [cf. §0], and that G is
edge-paired [cf. §0] for arbitrary l and edge-even [cf. §0] when l = 2.
Now if, say, e is a cusp that abuts to a vertex v, then one veriﬁes immediately
that there exist log étale cyclic coverings Y log → X log of degree an arbitrarily large
power of l which are totally ramiﬁed over e, but unramiﬁed over the nodes of X, as
well as over the cusps of X that abut to vertices = v. [Indeed, the existence of such
coverings follows immediately from the fact that X log is edge-paired for arbitrary l

(iv), this implies that

Write v1 , v2 for the two distinct vertices to which e abuts; C1 , C2 for the

C for the open subscheme obtained by removing the nodes that abut to vertices

X that were removed from C to obtain UC as bridge nodes, and to the nodes

To this end, let us ﬁrst observe that the characteristic sheaf of the log scheme
admits a section ζ over X satisfying the following properties:

(a) ζ vanishes on the open subscheme of X given by the complement of C;
(b) ζ coincides with iC · σ ∈ MS [cf. the notation of Example 1.1, (iii)] at

the generic points of C = C1 C2 ;
(c) ζ coincides with either (iC /if ) · ξ ∈ Mf or (iC /if ) · η ∈ Mf [cf. the
notation of Example 1.1, (iii), where we take “e” to be f ] at each bridge
node f .

18

[Indeed, the existence of such a section ζ follows immediately from the discussion
of Example 1.1, (iii), together with our deﬁnition of iC .] Thus, by taking the
inverse image of ζ in the monoid that deﬁnes the log structure of X log , we obtain
a line bundle L on X. Let Y → X be a ﬁnite étale Galois covering of order
a positive power of l such that L|Y has degree divisible by dΣ on every irreducible
component of Y , and Y → X restricts to a connected covering over every irreducible
def
component of X; Y log = X log ×X Y . [Note that the fact that such a covering exists
follows immediately from our assumption that G is sturdy.] Write C1Y , C2Y for the
irreducible components of Y lying over C1 , C2 , respectively; we shall apply the
terms “internal”, “external”, and “bridge” to nodes/cusps of Y that lie over such
nodes/cusps of X. Now let
Z log → Y log
be a log étale cyclic covering of degree dΣ satisfying the following properties:
(d) Z log → Y log restricts to an étale covering of schemes over the comple
def
ment of C Y = C1Y C2Y [cf. (a)], hence, in particular, over the external
nodes/cusps of Y ;
(e) Z log → Y log is ramiﬁed, with ramiﬁcation index dΣ /iΣ
C , over the generic
Y
Y
points of C1 , C2 , and, at each internal node of Y lying over e, determines
a covering corresponding to an open subgroup of Ie that contains Πe [cf.
(b)];
(f) for each bridge node f of Y , the restriction of Z log → Y log to the branch
Σ
of f that does not abut to C Y is ramiﬁed, with ramiﬁcation index dΣ ·iΣ
f /iC
[cf. (c)].
Indeed, to construct such a covering Z log → Y log , it suﬃces to construct a covering
satisfying (d), (f) over the complement of C Y [which is always possible, by the
conditions imposed on Y ], and then to glue this covering to a suitable [i.e., such
def

that (e) is satisﬁed!] Kummer log étale covering of (C Y )log = Y log ×Y C Y [by
an fs log scheme!] obtained by extracting a dΣ -th root of L|C Y [cf. the divisibility
condition on the degrees of L|C1Y , L|C2Y ]. [Here, we regard the Gm -torsor determined
by L|C Y as a subsheaf of the monoid deﬁning the log structure of (C Y )log .] Now if
the open subgroups deﬁned by the coverings Z log →
we write JZ ⊆ JY ⊆ ΠI for

Y log→ X log , then Ie , De ΠI ⊆ JY . On the other hand, Πe ⊆ JZ [cf. (e)] and
De ΠI ⊆ JZ [cf. (d)], while [cf. (e)]
[Ie : Ie



JZ ] = dΣ /iΣ
C > [I : IC ]
def

[since dΣ = l · iΣ
C · [I : IC ]]. Thus, it suﬃces to take J = JZ . This completes the
proof of assertion (viii).
Next, we consider assertion (ix). The fact that the image of De in H is open follows immediately from the fact that since the semi-graph G isﬁnite, some open subgroup of H necessarily ﬁxes e. On the other hand, since De ΠG = NΠG (Πe ) = Πe
[cf. [Mzk13], Proposition 1.2, (ii)] is abelian, hence not open in the slim, nontrivial

TOPICS IN ABSOLUTE ANABELIAN GEOMETRY II

19

proﬁnite group ΠG , it follows that De is not open in ΠH . This completes the proof
of assertion (ix).
Finally, we consider assertion (x). First, let us observe that an easy computation reveals that if the image of τS is a non-nodal, non-cuspidal point of the
irreducible component of X corresponding to a vertex vτ of G, then τI (I) = Ivτ .
Next, let us suppose that the image of τS is the node of X corresponding to some
node eτ of G. Then an easy computation [cf. the computations performed in the
proof of assertion (ii)] reveals that τI (I) ⊆ Ieτ , but that τI (I) is not contained in
Iv for any vertex v  to which eτ abuts. If, moreover, τI (I) ⊆ Iv for some vertex v
to which eτ does not abut, then [since the very existence of the node eτ implies that
X is singular] there exists a node e = eτ thatabuts to v, so τI (I) ⊆ Iv ⊆ Ie [cf. assertion (ii)]; but this implies that τI (I) ⊆ Ie Ieτ , so, by assertion (viii), it follows
that τI (I) ⊆ Iv for some vertex to which both e and eτ abut — a contradiction.
Thus, in summary, we conclude that in this case, τI is non-verticial.
Now suppose that τI is non-verticial and non-edge-like. Then the observations
of the preceding paragraph imply that the image of τS is a cusp of X. Write eτ
for the corresponding cusp of G. Thus, one veriﬁes immediately that τI (I) ⊆ Deτ .
The uniqueness of eτ then follows from assertion (viii) [and the fact that τI is nonverticial]. Thus, for the remainder of the proof of assertion (x), we may assume that
the image of τS is not a cusp. Now the remainder of assertion (x) follows formally,
in light of what of we have done so far, from assertions (iv), (viii). This completes
the proof of assertion (x).
Corollary 1.4.
(Graphicity of Isomorphisms of (D)PSC-Extensions)
Let l be a prime number. For i = 1, 2, let 1 → ΠGi → ΠHi → Hi → 1 be an
l-cyclotomically full [cf. Remark 1.2.3] DPSC-extension (respectively, PSCextension), associated to construction data (Xilog → Silog , Σi , Gi , ρHi , ιi ) (respectively, (Xilog → Silog , Σi , Gi , ρHi )) such that l ∈ Σi ; in the non-resp’d case, write
Ii ⊆ Hi for the inertia subgroup. Let
∼

φ H : H1 → H2 ;

∼

φΠ : ΠG1 → ΠG2

be compatible [i.e., with the respective outer actions of Hi on ΠGi ] isomorphisms
of proﬁnite groups; in the non-resp’d case, suppose further that φH (I1 ) = I2 .
Then Σ1 = Σ2 ; φΠ is graphic [cf. [Mzk13], Deﬁnition 1.4, (i)], i.e., arises from
∼
an isomorphism of semi-graphs of anabelioids G1 → G2 .
Proof. This follows immediately from [Mzk13], Corollary 2.7, (i), (iii). Here, as
in the proof of [Mzk13], Corollary 2.8, we ﬁrst apply [Mzk13], Corollary 2.7, (i)
[which suﬃces to complete the proof of Corollary 1.4 in the resp’d case and allows
one to reduce to the noncuspidal case in the non-resp’d case], then apply [Mzk13],
Corollary 2.7, (iii), to the compactiﬁcations of corresponding sturdy ﬁnite étale
coverings of the Gi .
We are now ready to deﬁne a purely group-theoretic, combinatorial analogue of
the notion of a stable polycurve given in [Mzk2], Deﬁnition 4.5.

Deﬁnition 1.5.
We shall refer to an extension of proﬁnite groups as a PPSCextension [i.e., “poly-PSC-extension”] if, for some positive integer n and some
nonempty set of primes Σ, it admits a “structure of pro-Σ PPSC-extension of
dimension n”. Here, for n a positive integer, Σ a nonempty set of primes, and
1→Δ→Π→H→1
an extension of proﬁnite groups, we deﬁne the notion of a structure of pro-Σ PPSCextension of dimension n as follows [inductively on n]:
(i) A structure of pro-Σ PPSC-extension of dimension 1 on the extension 1 →
Δ → Π → H → 1 is deﬁned to be a structure of pro-Σ PSC-extension. Suppose that
the extension 1 → Δ → Π → H → 1 is equipped with a structure of pro-Σ PPSCextension of dimension 1. Thus, we have an associated semi-graph of anabelioids
G, together with a continuous action of H on G, and a compatible isomorphism
∼
Δ → ΠG . We deﬁne the [horizontal] divisors of this PPSC-extension to be the
cusps of the PSC-extension 1 → Δ → Π → H → 1. Thus, each divisor c of the
PPSC-extension 1 → Δ → Π → H → 1 has associated inertia and decomposition
groups Ic ⊆ Dc ⊆ Π [cf. Deﬁnition 1.2, (i)]. Moreover, by [Mzk13], Proposition 1.2,
(i), a divisor is completely determined by [the conjugacy class of] its inertia group,
as well as by [the conjugacy class of] its decomposition group. Finally, we shall refer
to the extension 1 → Δ → Π → H → 1 [itself] as the ﬁber extension associated to
the PPSC-extension 1 → Δ → Π → H → 1 of dimension 1.
(ii) A structure of pro-Σ PPSC-extension of dimension n + 1 on the extension
1 → Δ → Π → H → 1 is deﬁned to be a collection of data as follows:
def

(a) a quotient Π  Π∗ such that Δ† = Ker(Π  Π∗ ) ⊆ Δ; thus, the image
Δ∗ ⊆ Π∗ of Δ in Π∗ determines an extension
1 → Δ∗ → Π∗ → H → 1
— which we shall refer to as the associated base extension; the subgroup
Δ† ⊆ Π determines an extension
1 → Δ† → Π → Π∗ → 1
— which we shall refer to as the associated ﬁber extension;
(b) a structure of pro-Σ PPSC-extension of dimension n on the base extension
1 → Δ∗ → Π∗ → H → 1;
(c) a structure of pro-Σ PPSC-extension of dimension 1 on the ﬁber extension
1 → Δ† → Π → Π∗ → 1;
(d) for each base divisor [i.e., divisor of the base extension] c∗ , a structure
of DPSC-extension on the extension
1 → Δ † → Π c ∗ = Π × Π∗ D c ∗ → D c ∗ → 1
def

— which we shall refer to as the extension at c∗ — which is compatible
with the PSC-extension structure on the ﬁber extension [cf. (c)], in the

TOPICS IN ABSOLUTE ANABELIAN GEOMETRY II

21

sense that both structures yield the same cuspidal inertia subgroups ⊆ Δ† ;
also, we require that the inertia subgroup of Dc∗ [i.e., that arises from this
structure of DPSC-extension] be equal to Ic∗ .
In this situation, we shall refer to Σ as the ﬁber prime set of the PPSC-extension
1 → Δ → Π → H → 1; we shall refer to as a divisor of the PPSC-extension
1 → Δ → Π → H → 1 any element of the union of the set of cusps — which we
shall refer to as horizontal divisors — of the PSC-extension 1 → Δ† → Π → Π∗ → 1
and, for each base divisor c∗ , the set of vertices of the DPSC-extension 1 → Δ† →
Πc∗ → Dc∗ → 1 — which we shall refer to as vertical divisors [lying over c∗ ]. Thus,
each divisor c of the PPSC-extension 1 → Δ → Π → H → 1 has associated inertia
and decomposition groups Ic ⊆ Dc ⊆ Π. In particular, whenever c is vertical and
lies over a base divisor c∗ , we have Ic ⊆ Dc ⊆ Πc∗ .
Remark 1.5.1. Thus, [the collection of ﬁber extensions arising from] any structure of PPSC-extension of dimension n on an extension 1 → Δ → Π → H → 1
determine two compatible sequences of surjections
def

def

def

def

Δn = Δ  Δn−1  . . .  Δ1  Δ0 = {1}
Πn = Π  Πn−1  . . .  Π1  Π0 = H
such that each [extension determined by a] surjection Πm  Πm−1 , for m =
1, . . . , n, is a ﬁber extension [hence equipped with a structure of PSC-extension];
Δm = Ker(Πm  H). If c = cn is a divisor of [the extension determined by]
Π = Πn , then [cf. Deﬁnition 1.5, (ii)] there exists a uniquely determined sequence
of divisors
cn → cn−1 → . . . → cnc −1 → cnc
— where nc ≤ n is a positive integer; for m = nc , . . . , n, cm is a divisor of Πm ;
cnc is a horizontal divisor; the notation “→” denotes the relation of “lying over”
[so cm+1 is a vertical divisor that lies over cm , for nc ≤ m < n] — together with
sequences of [conjugacies classes of ] inertia and decomposition groups
Icn → Icn−1 → . . . → Icnc −1 → Icnc
Dcn → Dcn−1 → . . . → Dcnc −1 → Dcnc
[i.e., for nc ≤ m < n, Icm+1 ⊆ Πm+1 maps into Icm ⊆ Πm , and Dcm+1 ⊆ Πm+1
maps into Dcm ⊆ Πm ].
Remark 1.5.2. Let 1 → Δ → Π → H → 1 be a PPSC-extension of dimension
n [where n is a positive integer]. Then one veriﬁes immediately that if Π• ⊆ Π
is any open subgroup of Π, then there exists an open subgroup Π•• of Π• that
[when equipped with the induced extension structure] admits a structure of PPSCextension of dimension n — cf. Remark 1.2.1. Here, we note that one must, in
general, pass to “some open subgroup” Π•• of Π• in order to achieve a situation in
which all of the ﬁber [PSC-]extensions have “stable reduction” [cf. Remark 1.2.1;
Deﬁnition 1.5, (ii), (d)].

Remark 1.5.3. For l a prime number, we shall say that a PPSC-extension 1 →
Δ → Π → H → 1 of dimension n is l-cyclotomically full if each of its n associated
ﬁber extensions [cf. Remark 1.5.1] is l-cyclotomically full as a PSC-extension [cf.
Remark 1.2.3]. Thus, it follows immediately from the ﬁnal portion of Remark 1.2.3
that the issue of whether or not the PPSC-extension 1 → Δ → Π → H → 1 is
l-cyclotomically full depends only on the sequence of surjections of proﬁnite groups
Πn  Πn−1  . . .  Π1  Π0 [cf. Remark 1.5.1].
Remark 1.5.4.

the exact sequence of étale fundamental groups [well-deﬁned up to inner automorphism] associated to the structure morphism UZ → S. Then by repeated application of the discussion of Example 1.1 to the ﬁbers of the successive ﬁbration
[mentioned above] of Z log by stable log curves, one veriﬁes immediately that:
(i) If k is of characteristic zero, then the structure of stable polycurve on
Z log determines a structure of proﬁnite PPSC-extension of dimension n
on the extension 1 → ΔZ → ΠZ → Gk → 1.
Moreover, one veriﬁes immediately that:
(ii) In the situation of (i), the divisors of ΠZ [in the sense of Deﬁnition 1.5]
are in natural bijective correspondence with the irreducible divisors of DZ
in a fashion that is compatible with the inertia and decomposition groups
of divisors of ΠZ [in the sense of Deﬁnition 1.5] and of irreducible divisors
of DZ [in the usual sense].
Finally, whether or not k is of characteristic zero, depending on the structure of
Z log [cf., e.g., Corollary 1.10 below], various quotients of the extension 1 → ΔZ →
ΠZ → Gk → 1 may be equipped with a structure of pro-Σ PPSC-extension [induced
by the structure of stable polycurve on Z], for various nonempty sets of prime
numbers Σ that are not equal to the set of all prime numbers; a similar observation
to (ii) concerning a natural bijective correspondence of “divisors” then applies to
such quotients. When considering such quotients 1 → Δ → Π → H → 1 of the
extension 1 → ΔZ → ΠZ → Gk → 1, it is useful to observe that the slimness of Δ
[cf. Proposition 1.6, (i), below] implies that such a quotient ΠZ  Π is completely
determined by the induced quotients ΔZ  Δ, Gk  H [cf. the discussion of the
out

Proposition 1.6.

(Basic Properties of PPSC-Extensions) Let
1→Δ→Π→H→1

be a pro-Σ PPSC-extension of dimension n [where n is a positive integer]; 1 →
Δ† → Π → Π∗ → 1 the associated ﬁber extension; c, c divisors of Π. Then:
(i) Δ is slim. In particular, if H is slim, then so is Π.
(ii) Dc is commensurably terminal in Π.
Σ.
(iii) We have: CΠ (Ic ) = Dc . As abstract proﬁnite groups, Ic ∼
=Z
(iv) Dc is not open in Π. The divisor c is horizontal if and only if Dc
projects to an open subgroup of Π∗ . If c is vertical and lies over a base divisor
c∗ , then Dc projects onto an open subgroup of Dc∗ .

(v) If Dc Dc is open in Dc , Dc , then c = c . In particular, a divisor of Π
is completely determined by its associated decomposition group.

(vi) If Ic Ic is open in Ic , Ic , then c = c . In particular, a divisor of Π is
completely determined by its associated inertia group.
Proof. Assertion (i) follows immediately from the “slimness of ΠG ” discussed in
Example 1.1, (ii) [cf. Deﬁnition 1.5, (i); Deﬁnition 1.5, (ii), (c)]. Next, we consider
assertion (ii). We apply induction on n. If c is horizontal, then assertion (ii)
follows from [the argument applied in] Proposition 1.3, (vii) [cf. also Deﬁnition 1.5,
(ii), (c)]. If c is vertical, then c lies over some base divisor c∗ , and we are in the
situation of Deﬁnition 1.5, (ii), (d). By Proposition 1.3, (vi), it follows that Dc
surjects onto some open subgroup of Dc∗ , hence that CΠ (Dc ) maps into CΠ∗ (Dc∗ );
by the induction hypothesis, CΠ∗ (Dc∗ ) = Dc∗ , so CΠ (Dc ) ⊆ Πc∗ . Thus, the fact
that CΠ (Dc ) = Dc follows from Proposition 1.3, (v). This completes the proof of
assertion (ii).
Next, we consider assertion (iii). Again we apply induction on n. If c is
horizontal, then assertion (iii) follows from [the argument applied in] Proposition
1.3, (i), (vii). If c is vertical, then c lies over some base divisor c∗ , and we are in
the situation of Deﬁnition 1.5, (ii), (d). By Proposition 1.3, (iii) [cf. Deﬁnition 1.5,
∼
 Σ . In particular, CΠ (Ic ) maps into
(ii), (d)], we have isomorphisms Ic → Ic∗ ∼
=Z
CΠ∗ (Ic∗ ); by the induction hypothesis, CΠ∗ (Ic∗ ) = Dc∗ . Thus, CΠ (Ic ) ⊆ Πc∗ , so
the fact that CΠ (Ic ) = Dc follows from Proposition 1.3, (v). This completes the
proof of assertion (iii).
Next, we consider assertion (iv). Again we apply induction on n. If c is
horizontal, then by [the argument applied in] Proposition 1.3, (ix), Dc is not open
in Π, but Dc projects to an open subgroup of Π∗ . If c is vertical, then c lies over some
base divisor c∗ , and we are in the situation of Deﬁnition 1.5, (ii), (d); Dc ⊆ Πc∗ . By
Proposition 1.3, (vi), Dc projects onto an open subgroup of Dc∗ . By the induction

24

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

hypothesis, Dc∗ is not open in Π∗ , so Πc∗ is not open in Π; thus, Dc is not open
in Π, and its image in Π∗ is not open in Π∗ . This completes the proof of assertion
(iv).
Next, we consider assertion (v). Again we apply induction on n. By assertion
(iv), c is horizontal if and only if c is. If c, c are horizontal, then the fact that
c = c follows from [Mzk13], Proposition 1.2, (i), (ii). Thus, we may suppose that
∗
 ∗
c, c are vertical and
 lie over respective base divisors c , (c ) . By assertion (iv), it
follows that Dc∗ D(c )∗ is open in Dc∗ , D(c )∗ ; by the induction hypothesis, this
implies that c∗ = (c )∗ . Thus, by intersecting with “ΠG ” [cf. Proposition 1.3, (v)]
and applying [Mzk13], Proposition 1.2, (i), we conclude that c = c . This completes
the proof of assertion (v). Finally, we observe that assertion (vi) is an immediate
consequence of assertions (iii), (v).
We are now ready to state and prove the main result of the present §1.

Remark 1.7.1.
In Theorem 1.7, instead of phrasing the result as an assertion concerning the preservation of structures via some isomorphism between two
PPSC-extensions, one may instead phrase the result as an assertion concerning the
existence of an explicit “group-theoretic algorithm” for reconstructing, from a single
given PPSC-extension, the various structures corresponding to graphicity, divisors,
and inertia and decomposition groups of divisors — i.e., in the fashion of [Mzk15],
Lemma 4.5, for cuspidal decomposition groups; a similar remark may be made
concerning Corollary 1.4. [We leave the routine details to the interested reader.]
Indeed, both Corollary 1.4 and Theorem 1.7 are, in essence, formal consequences
of the “graphicity theory” of [Mzk13], which [just as in the case of [Mzk15], Lemma
4.5] consists precisely of such explicit “group-theoretic algorithms” for reconstructing the various structures corresponding to graphicity in the case of semi-graphs of
anabelioids of PSC-type.
Before proceeding, we observe the following result, which is, in essence, independent of the theory of the present §1.

Theorem 4.12 [cf. also [Mzk2], Corollary 7.4], together with [in the case of assertion
(ii)] “Uchida’s theorem” [cf., e.g., [Mzk10], Theorem 3.1].
Finally, we study the consequences of the theory of the present §1 in the case
of conﬁguration spaces. We refer to [MT] for more details on the theory of conﬁguration spaces.
Deﬁnition 1.9.
Let l be a prime number; Σ a set of primes which is either of
cardinality one or equal to the set of all primes; X a hyperbolic curve of type (g, r)
over a ﬁeld k of characteristic ∈ Σ; k a separable closure of k; n ≥ 1 an integer; Xn
the n-th conﬁguration space associated to X [cf. [MT], Deﬁnition 2.1, (i)]; E the
index set [i.e., the set of factors — cf. [MT], Deﬁnition 2.1, (i)] of Xn ;
π1 (Xn ×k k)  Θ
the maximal pro-Σ quotient of π1 (Xn ×k k); Δ ⊆ Θ a product-theoretic open subgroup
[cf. [MT], Deﬁnition 2.3, (ii)]; 1 → Δ → Π → H → 1 an extension of proﬁnite
groups.

(i) We shall refer to as a labeling on E a bijection Λ : {1, 2, . . . , n} → E.
Thus, for each labeling Λ on E, we obtain a structure of hyperbolic polycurve [i.e., a
collection of data exhibiting Xn as a hyperbolic polycurve — cf. [Mzk2], Deﬁnition
4.6] on Xn , arising from the various natural projection morphisms associated to
Xn [cf. [MT], Deﬁnition 2.1, (ii)], by projecting in the order speciﬁed by Λ. In
particular, for each labeling Λ on E, we obtain a structure of PPSC-extension on
[the extension 1 → ΔΛ → ΔΛ → {1} → 1 associated to] some open subgroup
ΔΛ ⊆ Δ [which may be taken to be arbitrarily small — cf. Remark 1.5.2].
(ii) Let Λ be a labeling on E. Then we shall refer to a structure of PPSCextension on [the extension 1 → ΔΛ → ΠΛ → HΛ → 1 arising from 1 → Δ →
Π → H → 1 by intersecting with] an open subgroup ΠΛ ⊆ Π as Λ-admissible if it
induces the structure of PPSC-extension on ΔΛ discussed in (i).
(iii) We shall refer to as a structure of [pro-Σ] CPSC-extension [of type (g, r)
and dimension n, with index set E] [i.e., “conﬁguration (space) pointed stable curve
extension”] on the extension 1 → Δ → Π → H → 1 any collection of data as follows:
for each labeling Λ on E, a Λ-admissible structure of PPSC-extension on some
open subgroup ΠΛ ⊆ Π [which may be taken to be arbitrarily small — cf. Remark
1.5.2]. We shall refer to a structure of CPSC-extension on Π as l-cyclotomically
full if, for each labeling Λ on E, the Λ-admissible structure of PPSC-extension that

constitutes the given structure of CPSC-extension is l-cyclotomically full. We shall
refer to a structure of CPSC-extension on Π as strict if one may take Δ to be
Θ, and, for each labeling Λ on E, one may take ΠΛ to be Π. We shall refer to
1 → Δ → Π → H → 1 as a [pro-Σ] CPSC-extension [of type (g, r) and dimension
n, with index set E] if it admits a structure of CPSC-extension; if this structure of
CPSC-extension may be taken to be l-cyclotomically full (respectively, strict), then
we shall refer to the CPSC-extension itself as l-cyclotomically full (respectively,
strict). If 1 → Δ → Π → H → 1 is a CPSC-extension, then we shall refer to
(Σ, X, k, Θ) as construction data for this CPSC-extension.
(iv) Let 
k ⊆ k be a solvably closed [cf. [Mzk15], Deﬁnition 1.4] Galois extension
of k; suppose that
Z → Xn
is a ﬁnite étale covering such that Z ×k k → Xn ×k k is the [connected] covering
determined by the open subgroup Δ ⊆ Θ [so we have a natural surjection π1 (Z ×k
k)  Δ]. Then [cf. the discussion of Remark 1.5.4] we shall refer to a [structure of]
CPSC-extension [on] 1 → Δ → Π → H → 1 as arising from Z, 
k/k if there exist
∼

a surjection π1 (Z)  Π and an isomorphism Gal(k/k) → H that are compatible
with one another as well as with the natural surjections π1 (Z ×k k)  Δ, π1 (Z) 
Gal(k/k)  Gal(
k/k) and, moreover, satisfy the property that the structure of
CPSC-extension on 1 → Δ → Π → H → 1 is induced by the various structures of
hyperbolic polycurve on Z, Xn , associated to a suitable labeling of E [cf. (i)].
Corollary 1.10.
(Cominatorial Conﬁguration Spaces) Let l be a prime
number. For  = α, β, let
1 → Δ → Π  → H  → 1

full structure of CPSC-extension of type (g , r ) ∈

for either  = α or  = β, then we assume that both gα , gβ are ≥ 2. Let

a bijection Eα → Eβ between the respective index sets, together with compatible
isomorphisms between the various ﬁber subgroups of Δα , Δβ . [Note that even
though these results of [MT] are stated only in the case where the ﬁeld appearing
in the construction data is of characteristic zero, the results generalize immediately
to the case where this ﬁeld is of characteristic invertible in Σ , since any hyperbolic
curve in positive characteristic may be lifted to a hyperbolic curve in characteristic
zero in a fashion that is compatible with the maximal pro-Σ quotients of the

an extension of proﬁnite groups equipped with some [ﬁxed!] structure of

Σα = Σβ ; there exists a unique isomorphism of schemes Zα → Zβ that gives
rise to φ.
(ii) (Strict Semi-absoluteness) Suppose, for  = α, β, that k is either an
FF, an MLF, or an NF [cf. [Mzk15], §0]. Then φ(Δα ) = Δβ [i.e., φ is “strictly
semi-absolute”].
(iii) (Absolute Version of the Grothendieck Conjecture for Conﬁguration Spaces over MLF’s) Suppose, for  = α, β, that k is an MLF, that
n ≥ 2, that n ≥ 3 if X is proper, and that Σ is the set of all primes. Then
∼
there exists a unique isomorphism of schemes Zα → Zβ that gives rise to φ.
(iv) (Absolute Version of the Grothendieck Conjecture for Conﬁguration Spaces over NF’s) Suppose, for  = α, β, that k is an NF. Then
∼
Σα = Σβ ; there exists a unique isomorphism of schemes Zα → Zβ that gives
rise to φ.
Proof. Assertion (i) (respectively, (iv)) follows immediately from Corollary 1.10,
(ii), and Theorem 1.8, (i) (respectively, Theorem 1.8, (ii)) [applied to the coverings
of Zα , Zβ determined by the open subgroups of Corollary 1.10, (ii)]. Assertion (ii)
follows immediately from [Mzk15], Corollary 2.8, (ii). Note that in the situation of
assertion (ii), assertion (ii) implies that Σα = Σβ [since Σ may be characterized
as the unique minimal set of primes Σ such that Δ is a pro-Σ group]; moreover,

full for any l ∈ Σ
Finally, we consider assertion (iii). First, let us observe that by Corollary
1.10, (ii), and Theorem 1.8, (i) [applied to the coverings of Zα , Zβ determined by
the open subgroups of Corollary 1.10, (ii)], it suﬃces to verify that the isomorphism
∼
φH : H α → H β induced by φ [cf. assertion (ii)] arises from an isomorphism of ﬁelds
∼
kα → kβ . To this end, let us observe that by Corollary 1.10, (ii), we may apply
Theorem 1.7 to the present situation. Also, by Corollary 1.10, (i), n = nα = nβ
is always ≥ 2; moreover, if either of the X is proper, then n ≥ 3. Next, let
us observe that if X is proper (respectively, aﬃne), then the stable log curve
that appears in the logarithmic compactiﬁcation of the ﬁbration (X )3 → (X )2
(respectively, (X )2 → (X )1 ) over the generic point of the diagonal divisor of
(X )2 (respectively, over any cusp of X ) contains an irreducible component whose
interior is a tripod [i.e., a copy of the projective line minus three marked points]. In
particular, if we apply Theorem 1.7, (iii), to the vertical divisor determined by such
an irreducible component, then we may conclude that φ induces an isomorphism
between the decomposition groups of these vertical divisors. In particular, [after
possibly replacing the given kα , kβ by corresponding ﬁnite extensions of kα , kβ ] we
obtain, for  = α, β, a hyperbolic curve C over k , together with an isomorphism
of proﬁnite groups

φC : π1 (Cα ×kα 

k ) and the isomorphism φH ; moreover, here we may assume
H  on π1 (C ×k 
that, say, Cα is a ﬁnite étale covering of a tripod. [In particular, we observe that
k ) implies — cf. the
the existence of the natural outer action of H  on π1 (C ×k 
argument given in the proof of [Mzk10], Proposition 3.3 — that 
k is necessarily
an algebraic closure of k .] On the other hand, since the “absolute p-adic version
of the Grothendieck Conjecture” is known to hold in this situation [cf. [Mzk14],
Corollary 2.3], we thus conclude that φH does indeed arise from an isomorphism of
∼
ﬁelds kα → kβ , as desired. This completes the proof of assertion (iii).
Remark 1.11.1. At the time of writing Corollary 1.11, (iii), constitutes the only
absolute isomorphism version of the Grothendieck Conjecture over MLF’s [to the
knowledge of the author] that may be applied to arbitrary hyperbolic curves.

Section 2: Geometric Uniformly Toral Neighborhoods
In the present §2, we prove a certain “resolution of nonsingularities” type result [cf. Lemma 2.6; Remark 2.6.1; Corollary 2.11] — i.e., a result reminiscent of
the main results of [Tama2] [cf. also the techniques applied in the veriﬁcation of
“observation (iv)” given in the proof of [Mzk9], Corollary 3.11] — that allows us
to apply the theory of uniformly toral neighborhoods developed in [Mzk15], §3, to
prove a certain “conditional absolute p-adic version of the Grothendieck Conjecture” — namely, that “point-theoreticity implies geometricity” [cf. Corollary 2.9].
This condition of point-theoreticity may be removed if, instead of starting with a
hyperbolic curve, one starts with a “pro-curve” obtained by removing from a proper
curve some [necessarily inﬁnite] set of closed points which is “p-adically dense in a
Galois-compatible fashion” [cf. Corollary 2.10].
First, we recall the following “positive slope version of Hensel’s lemma” [cf.
[Serre], Chapter II, §2.2, Theorem 1, for a discussion of a similar result].
Lemma 2.1.
(Positive Slope Version of Hensel’s Lemma) Let k be a
complete discretely valued ﬁeld; Ok ⊆ k the ring of integers of k [equipped with
the topology determined by the valuation]; mk the maximal ideal of Ok ; π ∈ mk a
def

def

uniformizer of Ok ; A = Ok [[X1 , . . . , Xm ]]; B = Ok [[Y1 , . . . , Yn ]]. Let us suppose
that A (respectively, B) is equipped with the topology determined by its maximal
def

def

ideal; write X = Spf(A) (respectively, Y = Spf(B)), KA (respectively, KB ) for the
quotient ﬁeld of A (respectively, B), and ΩA (respectively, ΩB ) for the module of
continuous diﬀerentials of A (respectively, B) over Ok [so ΩA (respectively, ΩB ) is
a free A- (respectively, B-) module of rank m (respectively, n)]. Let φ : B → A be
the continuous Ok -algebra homomorphism induced by an assignment
B  Yj → fj (X1 , . . . , Xm ) ∈ A
[where j = 1, . . . , n]; let us suppose that the induced morphism dφ : ΩB ⊗B A → ΩA
satisﬁes the property that the image of dφ ⊗A KA is a KA -subspace of rank n in
ΩA ⊗A KA [so n ≤ m]. Then there exists a point β0 ∈ Y(Ok ) and a positive integer
r satisfying the following property: Let k  be a ﬁnite extension of k, with ring of
integers Ok ; write B(β0 , k  , r) for the “ball” of points β  ∈ Y(Ok ) such that β  , β0
map to the same point of Y(Ok /(π r )). Then the image of the map
X (Ok ) → Y(Ok )
induced by φ contains the “ball” B(β0 , k  , r).
Proof. First, let us observe that by Lemma 2.2 below, after possibly re-ordering
the Xi ’s, we may assume that the diﬀerentials dXi ∈ ΩA , where i = n + 1, . . . , m,
together with the diﬀerentials dfj ∈ ΩA , where j = 1, . . . , n, form a KA -basis of
ΩA ⊗A KA . Thus, by adding indeterminates Yn+1 , . . . , Ym to B and extending φ
by sending Yi → Xi for i = n + 1, . . . , m, we may assume without loss of generality
that n = m, A = B, X = Y, i.e., that the morphism Spf(φ) : X → Y = X is
“generically formally étale”.

Write M for the n by n matrix with coeﬃcients ∈ A given by {dfi /dXj }i,j=1,... ,n ;
g ∈ A for the determinant of M . Thus, by elementary linear algebra, it follows that
there exists an n by n matrix N with coeﬃcients ∈ A such that M ·N = N ·M = g·I
[where we write I for the n by n identity matrix]. By our assumption concerning
the image of dφ⊗A KA , it follows that g = 0, hence, by Lemma 2.3 below, that there
def
exist elements xi ∈ mk , where i = 1, . . . , n, such that g0 = g(x1 , . . . , xn ) ∈ mk is
nonzero. By applying appropriate “aﬃne translations” to the domain and codomain
of φ, we may assume without loss of generality that, for i = 1, . . . , n, we have
def
def
xi = fi (0, . . . , 0) = 0 ∈ Ok . Write M0 = M (0, . . . , 0), N0 = N (0, . . . , 0) [so M0 ,
N0 are n by n matrices with coeﬃcients ∈ Ok ].
Next, suppose that g0 ∈ msk \ms+1
k . In the remainder of the present proof, all
“vectors” are to be understood as column vectors with coeﬃcients ∈ Ok , where
k  is as in the statement of Lemma 2.1. Then I claim that for every vector y =
(y1 , . . . , yn ) ≡ 0 (mod π 3s ), there exists a vector x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) ≡ 0 (mod π 2s )
def
such that f(x) = (f1 (x), . . . , fn (x)) = y . Indeed, since Ok is complete and xi =
fi (0, . . . , 0) = 0, it suﬃces [by taking x{2} to be (0, . . . , 0)] to show, for each integer
l ≥ 2, that the existence of a vector x{l} ≡ 0 (mod π 2s ) such that f(x{l}) ≡ y
(mod π (l+1)s ) implies the existence of a vector x{l + 1} such that x{l + 1} ≡ x{l}
def
(mod π ls ), f(x{l + 1}) ≡ y (mod π (l+2)s ). To this end, we compute: Set  =
def
def
def
y − f(x{l}), η = g0−1 ·, δ = N0 ·η , x{l + 1} = x{l}+ δ. Thus,  ≡ 0 (mod π (l+1)s ),
η ≡ 0 (mod π ls ), δ ≡ 0 (mod π ls ), x{l + 1} ≡ x{l} (mod π ls ). In particular, the
squares of the elements of δ all belong to π (l+2)s · Ok [since l ≥ 2], so we obtain
that

f(x{l + 1}) ≡ f(x{l} + δ) ≡ f(x{l}) + M0 · δ

(mod π (l+2)s )

≡ y −  + M0 · N0 · η ≡ y −  + g0 · η ≡ y

(mod π (l+2)s )

— as desired. This completes the proof of the claim. On the other hand, one
veriﬁes immediately that the content of this claim is suﬃcient to complete the
proof of Lemma 2.1.
Remark 2.1.1. Thus, the usual “(slope zero version of ) Hensel’s lemma” corresponds, in the notation of Lemma 2.1, to the case where the image of the morphism
dφ is a direct summand of ΩA . In this case, we may take r = 1.
Remark 2.1.2.
In fact, according to oral communication to the author by
F. Oort, it appears that the sort of “positive slope version” of “Hensel’s lemma”
given in Lemma 2.1 [i.e., where the derivative is only generically invertible] preceded
the “slope zero version” that is typically referred to “Hensel’s lemma” in modern
treatments of the subject.
Lemma 2.2.
(Subspaces and Bases of a Vector Space) Let k be a ﬁeld; V
a ﬁnite-dimensional k-vector space with basis {ei }i∈I ; W ⊆ V a k-subspace. Then
there exists a subset J ⊆ I such that if we write VJ ⊆ V for the k-subspace generated
by the ej , for j ∈ J, then the natural inclusions VJ → V , W → V determine an
∼
isomorphism VJ ⊕ W → V of k-vector spaces.

Proof. This result is a matter of elementary linear algebra.
Lemma 2.3.
(Nonzero Values of Functions Deﬁned by Power Series)
Let k, Ok , A be as in Lemma 2.1; f = f (X1 , . . . , Xm ) ∈ A a nonzero element.
Then there exist elements xi ∈ mk , where i = 1, . . . , m, such that f (x1 , . . . , xm ) ∈
mk is nonzero.
Proof. First, I claim that by induction on m, it suﬃces to verify Lemma 2.3 when
m = 1. Indeed, for arbitrary m ≥ 2, one may write
f=

∞


i
c i Xm

i=0

— where ci = ci (X1 , . . . , Xm−1 ) ∈ Ok [[X1 , . . . , Xm−1 ]]. Since f = 0, it follows that
there exists at least one nonzero cj . Thus, by the induction hypothesis, it follows
that there exist xi ∈ mk , where i = 1, . . . , m−1, such that mk  cj (x1 , . . . , xm−1 ) =
0. Thus, f (x1 , . . . , xm−1 , Xm ) ∈ Ok [[Xm ]] is nonzero, so, again by the induction
hypothesis, there exists an xm ∈ mk such that mk  f (x1 , . . . , xm−1 , xm ) = 0. This
completes the proof of the claim.
def

Thus, for the remainder of the proof, we assume that m = 1 and write X = X1 ,
f=

∞


ci X i

i=0

— where ci ∈ Ok . Suppose that cj = 0, but that ci = 0 for i < j. Then there exists
a positive integer s such that cj ∈ msk . Let x ∈ msk be any nonzero element. Then
cj xj ∈ xj · msk , while ci xi ∈ xj · x · Ok ⊆ xj · msk for any i > j. But this implies that
mk  f (x) = 0, as desired.
In the following, we shall often work with [two-dimensional] log regular log
schemes. For various basic facts on log regular log schemes, we refer to [Kato];
[Mzk2], §1. If X log is a log regular log scheme, then for integers j ≥ 0, we shall
write
[j]
UX ⊆ X
for the j-interior of X log , i.e., the open subscheme of points at which the ﬁber
of the groupiﬁcation of the characteristic sheaf of X log is of rank ≤ j [cf. [MT],
[j]
Deﬁnition 5.1, (i); [MT], Proposition 5.2, (i)]. Thus, the complement of UX in X
def

[0]

is a closed subset of codimension > j [cf. [MT], Proposition 5.2, (ii)]; UX = UX is
the interior of X log [i.e., the maximal open subscheme over which the log structure
is trivial]. Also, we shall write
DX ⊆ X
for the closed subscheme X\UX with the reduced induced structure. Finally, we
remind the reader that in the following, all ﬁber products of fs log schemes are to
be taken in the category of fs log schemes [cf. §0].

a stable curve over S whose generic ﬁber Xη = X ×S η, where we write η = Spec(k),

X, respectively. We denote the resulting morphism of log schemes by X log → S log .
Deﬁnition 2.4.

factorization Vilog → X log ×S log Silog → X log as in (i); ψ log : V2log → V1log an X log morphism. Then let us observe that the log scheme Vilog is always log regular of
dimension 2 [cf. Proposition 2.5, (iv), below]. We shall refer to the log-modiﬁcation
φlog
as regular if the log structure of Vilog is deﬁned by a divisor with normal

Remark 2.4.1. Recall that there exists a base-ﬁeld isomorphic log-modiﬁcation
V log → X log
which is uniquely determined up to unique isomorphism [over X] by the following two properties: (a) V is regular; (b) V → S is a semi-stable curve. In fact,
it was this example that served as the primary motivating example for the author in developing the notion of a “log-modiﬁcation”. Note, moreover, that unlike
property (a), however, the principal condition that deﬁnes a [base-ﬁeld-isomorphic]
“log-modiﬁcation” — i.e., the condition that the morphism V → X be a proper, birational morphism that extends to a log étale morphism V log → X log of log schemes
— is a condition on the morphism V → X that has the virtue of being manifestly
stable under base-change [i.e., via morphisms that satisfy suitable, relatively mild
conditions]. This property of stability under base-change will be applied repeatedly
in the remainder of the present §2.
Proposition 2.5.

(First Properties of Log-modiﬁcations) For i = 1, 2, let
: Vilog → X log
φlog
i

be a log-modiﬁcation that admits a factorization Vilog → X log ×S log Silog → X log
as in Deﬁnition 2.4, (i); ψ log : V2log → V1log an X log -morphism. Write Si =
Spec(Oki ), where, for simplicity, we assume that the extension ki of k is a subﬁeld
of k; k i for the residue ﬁeld of ki ; Uψnoncr ⊆ V1 for the open subscheme given by the
complement of the critical points of ψ log . Let • ∈ {1, 2}. Then:

(i) (The Noncriticality of the 1-Interior) We have: UV1 ⊆ Uψnoncr .
(ii) (Isomorphism over the Noncritical Locus) The morphism V2log →
V1log ×S log S2log determined by ψ log is an isomorphism over Uψnoncr .

(iii) (Log Smoothness and Unramiﬁed Log-modiﬁcations) V•log is log
smooth over S•log . In particular, the sheaf of relative logarithmic diﬀerentials of
the morphism V•log → S•log is a line bundle, which we shall denote ωV log /S log ;

we have a natural isomorphism ψ ∗ ωV log /S log ∼

modiﬁcation.

(iv) (Regularity and Log Regularity) V•log is log regular; UV• is regular. Moreover, there exists a regular log-modiﬁcation V◦log → X log that admits

a base-ﬁeld-isomorphic X log -morphism V◦log → V•log such that every irreducible
component C of the special ﬁber V ◦ is smooth over the residue ﬁeld k ◦ of the
base-ﬁeld k◦ of V◦log . Finally, if the log-modiﬁcation V◦log → X log is unramiﬁed
at such an irreducible component C, and we write DC ⊆ C for the reduced divisor

modiﬁcation [so DV2 is a divisor with normal crossings]. Then, after possibly
replacing k2 by a ﬁnite unramiﬁed extension of the discretely valued ﬁeld k2 , every irreducible component C of DV2 that lies in the exceptional divisor of ψ log
is isomorphic to the projective line over the residue ﬁeld k(c) of the point c of
V1log ×S log S2log to which C maps. Moreover, C meets the other irreducible components of DV2 at precisely two k(c)-valued points of C. That is to say, every
connected component of the exceptional divisor of ψ log is a “chain of P1 ’s”.
(vi) (Dual Graphs of Special Fibers) The spectrum V x of the local ring
obtained by completing the geometric special ﬁber V • ×k• k at any point x which
does not (respectively, does) belong to the 1-interior has precisely two (respectively, precisely one) irreducible component(s). In particular, the special ﬁber
V • determines a dual graph ΓV • , whose vertices correspond bijectively to the
irreducible components of V • ×k• k, and whose edges correspond bijectively to the
[1]

points of (V• \UV• ) ×k• k [so each edge abuts to the vertices corresponding to the
irreducible components in which the point corresponding to the edge lies]. In discussions of ΓV • , we shall frequently identify the vertices and edges of ΓV • with the
corresponding irreducible components and points of V • ×k• k. If the natural Galois
action of Gal(k/k • ) on ΓV • is trivial, then we shall say that V•log is split. Finally,
def

the loop-rank lp-rk(V • ) = lp-rk(ΓV • ) [cf. §0] is equal to the loop-rank lp-rk(X).
(vii) (Filtered Projective Systems) Given any log-modiﬁcation V◦log →

X log , there exists a log-modiﬁcation V•◦

V•◦ → V• , V•◦ → V◦ . That is to say, the log-modiﬁcations over X log form a

we shall say that the morphisms Yη → Xη , Y log → X log , W•log → V•log are loopifying. Let C be an irreducible component of W • . Then we shall refer to C as
base-stable [relative to Yη → Xη ] (respectively, base-semi-stable [relative to
W•log → V•log ]) if it maps ﬁnitely to a(n) stable (respectively, arbitrary) irreducible
component of V • . If there exist log-modiﬁcations W◦log → Y log , V◦log → X log that

base-semi-stable [relative to Yη → Xη ].

K◦ a discretely valued ﬁeld containing k◦ which induces an inclusion Ok◦ ⊆ OK◦

morphism V◦ → S◦ = Spec(Ok◦ ) is a semi-stable curve, and x◦ extends to a

closed subset]; Ux• = V• \Fx• ⊆ V• [so the image of x• lies in Ux• ]. Write Jη → η
for the Jacobian of Xη ; J → S for the uniquely determined semi-abelian
scheme over S that extends Jη ; ιη : Xη → Jη for the morphism that sends a T valued point ξ [where T is a k-scheme] of Xη , regarded as a divisor on Xη ×k T , to
the point of Jη determined by the degree zero divisor ξ − (x• |T ). Then ιη extends
uniquely to a morphism Ux• → J. If, moreover, X is loop-ample [cf. §0], then
this morphism Ux• → J is unramiﬁed.
(xi) (Lifting Simple Paths) In the situation of (viii), suppose further that
the following conditions hold:
(a) the log-modiﬁcations W•log → Y log , V•log → X log are base-ﬁeld-isomorphic
and split [cf. (vi)];
(b) the morphism W•log → V•log is ﬁnite.
Let γV be a simple path [cf. §0] in the dual graph ΓV • of V • [cf. (vi)]. Then
there exists a simple path γW in the dual graph ΓW • of W • that lifts γV in the
∼
sense that the morphism W • → V • induces an isomorphism of graphs γW → γV .
Suppose further that the following condition holds:
(c) the morphism W•log → V•log is loop-preserving.


Then γW is unique in the sense that if γW
is any simple path in ΓW • that lifts γV

and is co-terminal [cf. §0] with γW , then γW = γW
.

(xii) (Loop-preservation and Wild Ramiﬁcation) In the situation of (xi),
suppose that, in addition to the conditions (a), (b), (c) of (xi), the following conditions hold:
(d) there exists a prime number p such that k is of characteristic p, and
the morphism Yη → Xη is ﬁnite étale Galois and of degree p;
(e) the morphism Yη → Xη is wildly ramiﬁed over the terminal vertices
[cf. §0] of the simple path γV .
Let wexc be a vertex of ΓW • that corresponds to an irreducible component of the
exceptional divisor of W•log → Y log [i.e., a non-stable irreducible component of
W • ] and, moreover, maps to a vertex vexc of ΓV • lying in γV . Then the morphism
Yη → Xη is wildly ramiﬁed at wexc .
Proof. First, we consider assertion (i). We may assume without loss of generality
that ψ is a base-ﬁeld-isomorphism. Then it follows from the simple structure of the
[1]
monoid N that any log étale birational morphism over UV1 is, in fact, étale. This
completes the proof of assertion (i). Next, we consider assertion (iii). Since the
morphism X log → S log is log smooth, and the morphism V•log → X log ×S log S•log is
log étale, we conclude that V•log is log smooth over S•log ; the portion of assertion (iii)
concerning ωV log /S log then follows immediately. To verify the portion of assertion
•
•
(iii) concerning unramiﬁed log-modiﬁcations, it suﬃces to observe that, in light of
the well-known local structure of the nodes of the stable log curve X log ×S log S•log →
def
S•log , there exists a ﬁnite extension k◦ of k• such that, if we write S◦ = Spec(Ok◦ ),
def

then the morphism V◦log = V•log ×S log S◦log → S◦log admits sections that intersect
•
 [1]
with every irreducible component of V ◦
UV◦ ; thus, the fact that V◦log → X log
is an unramiﬁed log-modiﬁcation follows immediately from the log smoothness of
[1]
UV• , in light of the simple structure of the monoid N. This completes the proof of
assertion (iii).
Next, we consider assertion (iv). The fact that V•log is log regular follows
immediately from the log smoothness of V•log over S•log [cf. assertion (iii)]; the fact
[1]
[1]
that UV• is regular then follows from the log regularity of UV• , in light of the simple
structure of the monoid N. To construct a regular log-modiﬁcation V◦log → X log that
admits a base-ﬁeld-isomorphic X log -morphism V◦log → V•log , it suﬃces to “resolve
[1]
the singularities” at the ﬁnitely many points of V• \UV• . To give a “resolution
of singularities” of the sort desired, it suﬃces to construct, for each such v, a
“fan” arising from a “locally ﬁnite nonsingular subdivision of the strongly convex
rational polyhedral cone associated to the stalk of the characteristic sheaf of V•log
at v that is equivariant with respect to the Galois action on the stalk” [cf., e.g.,
the discussion at the beginning of [Mzk2], §2]. Since this is always possible [cf.,
e.g., the references quoted in the discussion of loc. cit.], we thus obtain a regular
log-modiﬁcation V◦log → X log that admits a base-ﬁeld-isomorphic X log -morphism
V◦log → V•log ; moreover, by replacing V◦log with the result of blowing up once more at
[1]
various points of V◦ \UV◦ , we may assume that each irreducible component C of V ◦

TOPICS IN ABSOLUTE ANABELIAN GEOMETRY II

39

is smooth over k ◦ , as desired. Finally, the construction of the natural isomorphism
 [1]
∼
ωC/k◦ (DC ) → ωV log /S log |C is immediate over C UV◦ [cf. our assumption that the
◦

◦

log-modiﬁcation V◦log → X log is unramiﬁed at C!]; one may then extend this natural
isomorphism to C by means of an easy local calculation at the points of DC . This
completes the proof of assertion (iv). By assertions (iii) and (iv), the underlying
schemes of the domain and codomain of the morphism V2log → V1log ×S log S2log of
1
assertion (ii) are normal. Thus, assertion (ii) follows immediately from Zariski’s
main theorem.

Next, we consider assertion (v). We may assume without loss of generality
are base-ﬁeld-isomorphic [so ψ log is log étale]. Also, by blowing up
that the φlog
i
[1]
once more at various points of V2 \UV2 [cf. the proof of assertion (iv)], one veriﬁes
immediately that we may assume without loss of generality that C is smooth over k 2 .
Let us write C log for the log scheme obtained by equipping C with the log structure
determined by the points of C that meet the other irreducible components of DV2 .
Thus, after possibly replacing k2 by a suitable ﬁnite unramiﬁed extension of k2 , we
may assume that the interior UC ⊆ C of C log is the open subscheme of a smooth
proper curve of genus g over k(c) obtained by removing a divisor DC ⊆ C of degree
r > 0 over k(c). On the other hand, it follows immediately from the deﬁnition
of a log-modiﬁcation [cf. Deﬁnition 2.4, (i)] and the well-known general theory of
toric varieties [cf. the discussion of “fans” in the proof of assertion (iv)] that the
pair (C, DC ) determines a toric variety of dimension one, and hence that UC is
isomorphic to a copy of Gm over k(c), i.e., that g = 0, r = 2, as desired. Now the
remaining portions of assertion (v) follow immediately. This completes the proof
of assertion (v).
Next, we consider assertion (vi). First, we observe that if x belongs to the
1-interior, then it follows immediately from the simple structure of the monoid
N [and the deﬁnition of the 1-interior] that Vx is irreducible. Thus, it suﬃces to
consider the case where x does not belong to the 1-interior. Let V◦log → X log ,
V◦log → V•log be as in assertion (iv). We may assume without loss of generality
that the log-modiﬁcations V•log → X log , V◦log → X log are base-ﬁeld-isomorphisms.
Also, by replacing k be a ﬁnite unramiﬁed extension of k, we may assume that every
irreducible component of V • is geometrically irreducible over k, and that every point
[1]
of V• \UV• is deﬁned over k. Then, since V◦log → V•log is birational, and V•log is log
regular, hence, in particular, normal [cf. assertion (iv)], it follows from Zariski’s
[1]
main theorem that the points of V• \UV• correspond precisely [via V◦log → V•log ] to
[1]

the connected components of the inverse image of V• \UV• via V◦log → V•log . Thus,
the remainder of assertion (vi) follows immediately from assertion (v), applied to
V◦log → V•log , V◦log → X log . This completes the proof of assertion (vi).

Next, we consider assertion (vii). We may assume without loss of generality
that the log-modiﬁcations V•log → X log , V◦log → X log are base-ﬁeld-isomorphic.
log def
Then to verify assertion (vii), it suﬃces to observe that one may take V•◦
=
log
log
V• ×X log V◦ . This completes the proof of assertion (vii). In a similar vein,
assertion (viii) follows by observing that the fact that Yη → Xη extends to a
morphism Y log → X log follows, for instance, from [Mzk2], Theorem A, (1); thus,
def

one may take W•log = V•log ×X log Y log . This completes the proof of assertion (viii).

Next, we consider assertion (ix). We may assume without loss of generality that
k = k◦ . Let V◦log → X log be the base-ﬁeld-isomorphic unramiﬁed log-modiﬁcation
determined by the regular semi-stable model of X over S [cf. Remark 2.4.1]. Since
V◦ is proper over S, it follows that x◦ extends to a point ∈ V◦ (OK◦ ); if this point
[1]
fails to lie in UV◦ , then it follows that it meets one of the nodes of V◦ . On the
other hand, since [after possibly replacing k◦ by a ﬁnite unramiﬁed extension of the
discretely valued ﬁeld k◦ ] the completion of the regular scheme V◦ at such a node
is necessarily isomorphic over Ok◦ to a complete local ring of the form
Ok◦ [[s, t]]/(s · t − π◦ )
[where s, t are indeterminates; π◦ is a uniformizer of Ok◦ ], this contradicts our
∼
×
assumption that Ok◦ ⊆ OK◦ induces a bijection k◦ /Ok×◦ → K◦ /OK
[i.e., by con◦
sidering the images via pull-back by x◦ of s, t in these value groups, in light of the
relation “s · t − π◦ ”]. This completes the proof of assertion (ix).
Next, we consider assertion (x). Write N → S for the Néron model of Jη over
S. Thus, J may be regarded as an open subscheme of N . Note that the existence
of the rational point x• implies that Ux• is smooth over S [cf. the proof of assertion
(iii)]. Thus, it follows from the universal property of the Néron model [which is
typicallyused to deﬁne the Néron model] that ιη extends to a morphism Ux• → N .
Since C Ux• is connected [cf. the deﬁnition of Ux• ], the fact that the image of this
morphism lies in J ⊆ N follows immediately from the fact that [by deﬁnition] it
maps x• to the identity element of J(Ok ). Thus, we obtain a morphism Ux• → J.
To verify that this morphism is unramiﬁed, it suﬃces [by considering appropriate
translation automorphisms of J] to show that it induces a surjection on Zariski
cotangent spaces at x• ; but the induced map on Zariski cotangent spaces at x• is
easily computed [by considering the long exact sequence on cohomology associated
to the short exact sequence 0 → OV• → OV• (x• ) → OV• (x• )|x• → 0 on V• , then
taking duals] to be the map

[where we recall the natural isomorphism ωX log /S log |V log → ωV log /S log , arising from

→ X log is log étale — cf. assertion (iii)] given by evaluating
the fact that φlog
• : V•
at x• , hence is surjective so long as X is loop-ample [cf. §0]. This completes the
proof of assertion (x).

Next, we consider assertion (xi). First, let us observe that it follows immediately from the surjectivity of W • → V • that every vertex of ΓV • may be lifted to
a vertex of ΓW • . Next, I claim that every edge of ΓV • may be lifted to an edge of
ΓW • . Indeed, let y ∈ W• (k), x ∈ V• (k) be such that y → x; write Wy , Vx for the
respective spectra of the local rings obtained by completing W• , V• at y, x. Then
the morphism W log → V log induces a ﬁnite, dominant, hence surjective, morphism
Wy → Vx . In particular, this morphism Wy → Vx induces a surjection from the set
Iy of irreducible components of W • that pass through y to the set Ix of irreducible
components of V • that pass through x. Thus, if x corresponds to an edge of the
dual graph ΓV • , then this set Ix is of cardinality 2 [cf. assertion (vi)]; since Iy is
of cardinality ≤ 2 [cf. assertion (vi)], the existence of the surjection Iy  Ix thus

TOPICS IN ABSOLUTE ANABELIAN GEOMETRY II

41

∼

implies that this surjection is, in fact, a bijection Iy → Ix , hence that y corresponds
to an edge of ΓW • [cf. assertion (vi)]. This completes the proof of the claim. Thus,
by starting at one of the terminal vertices of γV , and proceeding along γV from
vertex to edge to vertex, etc., one concludes immediately the existence of a simple
path γW lifting γV . To verify uniqueness when condition (c) holds, write v1 , v2 for
the terminal vertices of γV ; e for the edge of γV that is nearest to v1 among those

; v1 (respectively, v2 ) for the vertex
edges of γV that lift to diﬀerent edges in γW , γW

to which e abuts that lies in the same connected component of the complement of
e in γV as v1 (respectively, v2 ); v1+ for the vertex of γV that is nearest to v1 among
those vertices of γV lying between v2 and v2 which lift to the same vertex in γW ,

. Then by traveling along γW from the vertex w1 of γW lifting v1 to the vertex
γW
+

w1 of γW lifting v1+ , then traveling back along γW
from w1+ [which, by deﬁnition,


] to w1 [which, by deﬁnition, also belongs to γW
], one obtains
also belongs to γW
a “nontrivial loop” in ΓW • [i.e., a nonzero element of H1 (ΓW • , Q)] that maps to
a “trivial loop” in ΓV • [i.e., the zero element of H1 (ΓV • , Q)]. But this contradicts
the assumption that the morphism W•log → V•log is loop-preserving [cf. condition
(c)]. This completes the proof of assertion (xi).
Finally, we consider assertion (xii). First, we observe that the hypotheses of
assertion (xii) are stable with respect to base-change in S. In particular, we may
always replace S = Spec(Ok ) by the normalization of S in some ﬁnite separable
extension of k. Next, by assertion (iv), we may assume that there exists a baseﬁeld-isomorphic, regular, split log-modiﬁcation V◦log → X log , together with an X log def
morphism V◦log → V•log . Moreover, if we take W◦log = V◦log ×V log W•log , then
•

the composite morphism W◦log → W•log → Y log forms a base-ﬁeld-isomorphic logmodiﬁcation such that the projection W◦log → V◦log is ﬁnite [by condition (b); cf.
also the ﬁniteness mentioned in the discussion entitled “Log Schemes” given in
§0]. In particular, by replacing W•log → V•log by W◦log → V◦log [cf. also assertion
(v), concerning the eﬀect on the simple path γV ; assertion (vi), concerning the
eﬀect on the loop-rank], we may assume that the log-modiﬁcation V•log → X log is
regular. Here, let us note that since W•log → V•log is ﬁnite, and W•log is log regular
[cf. assertion (iv)], which implies, in particular, that W• is normal [so W• is the
def
log
normalization of V• in Yη ], it follows that G = Gal(Yη /Xη ) (∼
= Z/pZ) acts on W• .
Also, by assertion (iv), we may assume that there exists a base-ﬁeld-isomorphic,
log
log
regular, split log-modiﬁcation W
→ Y log , together with a Y log -morphism W
→

W•log ; moreover, it follows immediately from the proof of assertion (iv) that we
log
log
may choose W
so that the action of G extends to W
. Finally, we observe that
it follows from assertion (v) that every irreducible component of the exceptional
log
divisors of W  , V • [relative to the morphisms W
→ Y log , V•log → X log ] is
isomorphic to P1k .

Let EW be the irreducible component of W • corresponding to wexc . Thus,
there exists a unique irreducible component FW of W  that maps ﬁnitely to EW ;
moreover, EW maps ﬁnitely to an irreducible component EV of V • [corresponding
to vexc ] that lies in the exceptional divisor of V•log → X log . Thus, we have ﬁnite
morphisms
FW → EW → EV

42

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

— where FW , EV are isomorphic to P1k ; the ﬁrst morphism FW → EW is a morphism between irreducible schemes that induces an isomorphism between the respective function ﬁelds. Now to complete the proof of assertion (xii), it suﬃces to
assume that
the composite morphism FW → EV is generically étale
and derive a contradiction. Let us refer to the two k-valued points of FW (respec[1]
[1]
tively, EV ) [cf. assertion (v)] that lie outside UW (respectively, UV• ) as the critical
points of FW (respectively, EV ). Then since the divisor on W•log (respectively, V•log )
at which the morphism W•log → V•log is [necessarily wildly] ramiﬁed does not, by our
assumption, contain EW (respectively, EV ), it follows that the divisor on FW (respectively, EV ) at which FW → EV is ramiﬁed is supported in the divisor deﬁned
by the two critical points of FW (respectively, EV ).
Next, let us write v1 , v2 for the terminal vertices of γV . Note that by conditions
(d), (e), it follows that v1 , v2 lift, respectively, to unique vertices w1 , w2 of ΓW • . In
particular, it follows that any two simple paths in ΓW • lifting γV are co-terminal.
Now I claim that the morphism FW → EV is of degree p. Indeed, if this morphism

of wexc such that
is of degree 1, then it follows that there exists a G-conjugate wexc

wexc = wexc . Thus, considering the G-conjugates of any simple path in ΓW • lifting
γV , it follows that we obtain two distinct [necessarily co-terminal!] simple paths
in ΓW • lifting γV . But this contradicts the uniqueness portion of assertion (xi).
This completes the proof of the claim. Note that this claim implies that we have
G-equivariant morphisms FW → EW → EV , where G acts trivially on EV .
Next, I claim that G ﬁxes each of the critical points of FW . Indeed, it follows
immediately from the deﬁnitions that G preserves the divisor of critical points of
FW . Thus, if G fails to ﬁx each of the critical points of FW , then it follows that G
permutes the two critical points of FW , hence that p = 2. But since FW → EV is
of degree p and unramiﬁed outside the divisor of critical points of FW , this implies
that P1k ∼
= FW → EV ∼
= P1k is ﬁnite étale, hence [since, as is well-known, the
étale fundamental group of P1k is trivial!] that FW → EV is an isomorphism — in
contradiction to the fact that FW → EV is of degree p > 1. This completes the
proof of the claim. Note that this claim implies that the morphism FW → EV is
ramiﬁed at the critical points of FW , and that the set of two critical points of FW
maps bijectively to the set of two critical points of EV . In particular, it follows that
FW → EV determines a ﬁnite étale covering (Gm )k → (Gm )k of degree p. On the
other hand, any morphism (Gm )k → (Gm )k is determined by a unit on (Gm )k , i.e.,
by a k × -multiple of U n , where U is the standard coordinate on (Gm )k , and n is the
degree of the morphism. Since the morphism determined by a k × -multiple of U p
clearly fails to be generically étale, we thus obtain a contradiction. This completes
the proof of assertion (xii).
In the following, we shall write
“π1 (−)”
for the “log fundamental group” of the log scheme in parentheses, relative to an
appropriate choice of basepoint [cf. [Ill] for a survey of the theory of log fundamental
groups]. Also, from now on, we shall assume, until further notice, that:

polynomial h(T ) of degree n with coeﬃcients in k that are suﬃciently close [in the
topology of k] to the coeﬃcients of f (T ) also splits in k  . Thus, it follows from our
assumption that k is of countable cardinality that k admits a countable collection F
of subﬁelds which are ﬁnite and Galois over k such that every ﬁnite Galois extension
of k contained in k is contained in a subﬁeld that belongs to the collection F.
In some sense, the main technical result of the present §2 is the following lemma.
Lemma 2.6.
(Prime-power Cyclic Coverings and Log-modiﬁcations)
Suppose that X is loop-ample [cf. §0]. Then:
(i) (Existence of Wild Ramiﬁcation) Let
Xη+ → Xη
be a ﬁnite étale Galois covering of hyperbolic curves over η with stable reduction
over S such that Gal(Xη+ /Xη ) is isomorphic to a product of 2gX copies of Z/pZ [so
such a covering always exists after possibly replacing k by a ﬁnite extension of k];
V log → X log a split, base-ﬁeld-isomorphic log-modiﬁcation. Then Xη+ → Xη
is wildly ramiﬁed over every irreducible component C of V .
(ii) (Loopiﬁcation vs. Component Crushing) After possibly replacing k
by a ﬁnite extension of k, there exist data as follows: a stable curve Y → S with
def
smooth generic ﬁber Yη = Y ×S η and associated log scheme Y log ; a cyclic ﬁnite
étale covering Yη → Xη of degree a positive power of p — which determines
a morphism
Y log → X log
— such that at least one of the following two conditions is satisﬁed:
(a) Yη → Xη is loopifying and wildly ramiﬁed at some [necessarily]
stable irreducible component C of Y which is potentially base-semistable relative to Yη → Xη ;
(b) there exists a [necessarily] stable irreducible component C of Y which
is not potentially base-semi-stable relative to Yη → Xη .
(iii) (Components Crushed to the 1-Interior) In the situation of (ii),
there exists a commutative diagram

natural action of Gal(Yη /Xη ) on Y log extends to W log — such that the following
property is satisﬁed: If condition (a) (respectively, (b)) of (ii) is satisﬁed, then the
unique irreducible component CW of W that maps ﬁnitely to the irreducible component C of condition (a) (respectively, (b)) maps ﬁnitely to Q (respectively, maps
[1]
to a closed point of UQ ).
(iv) (Group-theoretic Characterization of Crushing) In the situation
of (ii), let C be a [necessarily] stable irreducible component of Y ; l a prime
= p. Write Gal(k/k)  Gklog for the maximal tamely ramiﬁed quotient;
ΔY log (respectively, ΔX log ) for the maximal pro-l quotient of the kernel of
the natural [outer] surjection π1 (Y log )  Gklog (respectively, π1 (X log )  Gklog );
ΔC ⊆ ΔY log for the decomposition group of C [well-deﬁned up to conjugation by an element of π1 (Y log )]. [Thus, ΔY log (respectively, ΔX log ) may be identiﬁed with the maximal pro-l quotient of Ker(π1 (Yη )  Gal(k/k)) (respectively,
Ker(π1 (Xη )  Gal(k/k))) — cf., e.g., [MT], Proposition 2.2, (v).] Then the following two conditions are equivalent:
(a) the image of ΔC in ΔX log is trivial;
(b) there exists a commutative diagram

already referred to — such that the unique irreducible component CW of
[1]
W that maps ﬁnitely to C maps to a closed point of UQ .
(v) (Group-theoretic Characterization of Wild Ramiﬁcation) In the
situation of (iv), the morphism Yη → Xη is wildly ramiﬁed at C if and only if
Gal(Yη /Xη ) stabilizes [the conjugacy class of ] and induces the identity [outer
automorphism] on the [normally terminal — cf. [Mzk13], Proposition 1.2, (ii);
[Mzk17], Lemma 2.12] subgroup ΔC of ΔY log .
Proof. Let us write
def

TX = π1 (Xη ×k k)ab ⊗ Zp
for the maximal pro-p abelian quotient of the geometric fundamental group of Xη .
Thus, TX is a free Zp -module of rank 2gX .
Next, we consider assertion (i). Upon base-change to k, the covering Xη+ → Xη
corresponds to the open subgroup p · TX ⊆ TX . Let us write J → S for the
uniquely determined semi-abelian scheme that extends the Jacobian Jη → η of
Xη . After possibly replacing k by a ﬁnite extension of k, there exists a rational
[1]
point x ∈ UV (Ok ) that meets C. Thus, for some Zariski open neighborhood Ux
of the image of x in V , we obtain a morphism ι : Ux → J, as in Proposition 2.5,
(x). Moreover, since we have assumed that X is loop-ample, it follows that this
morphism ι is unramiﬁed. Now if the morphism Xη+ → Xη is tamely ramiﬁed over

C, then it follows from our assumptions on the covering Xη+ → Xη , together with
the interpretation of J in terms of Néron models [cf. the proof of Proposition 2.5,
(x)], that [after possibly replacing k by a ﬁnite extension of k] there exists some
ﬁnite separable extension L of the function ﬁeld k(C) of C such that there exists a
commutative diagram

— where  is the [étale] morphism determined by the given inclusion k(C) → L;
[p] is the morphism given by multiplication by p on the group scheme J; ιC is the
restriction of ι to Spec(k(C)). On the other hand, since the restriction of [p] to
the special ﬁber J of J factors through the Frobenius morphism on J, it follows
that [p] ◦ ιL fails to be unramiﬁed. Thus, since ιC ◦  is unramiﬁed, we obtain a
contradiction to the commutativity of the diagram. This completes the proof of
assertion (i).
Next, we consider assertion (ii). If V log → X log is a split, base-ﬁeld-isomorphic
log-modiﬁcation, and C is an irreducible component of V , then let us write
D C ⊆ TX
for the decomposition group associated to C and
IC ⊆ D C
for the wild inertia group associated to C. Note that since TX is abelian, and
V log is split, it follows that the subgroups DC , IC are well-deﬁned [and completely
determined by C]. Moreover, by assertion (i), it follows that IC has nontrivial
image in TX ⊗ Z/pZ.
Next, I claim that if V◦log → X log is a split, base-ﬁeld-isomorphic log-modiﬁcation,
then V◦log → X log is completely determined, as a log scheme over X log , up to countably many possibilities, by X log . Indeed, the morphism V◦log → X log is an isomorphism over the 1-interior of X log [cf. Proposition 2.5, (i), (ii)]. Moreover, at
each of the ﬁnitely many points x of X log lying in the complement of the 1-interior,
V◦log → X log is determined by countably many choices of certain combinatorial data
involving the groupiﬁcation of the stalk of the characteristic sheaf of X log at x [cf.
the proof of Proposition 2.5, (iv)]. This completes the proof of the claim. In particular, since k is assumed to be of countable cardinality [cf. the discussion preceding
the present Lemma 2.6], it follows that:
There exists a countable coﬁnal collection M of split log-modiﬁcations of
X log .
In particular, it follows that if we write C for the set of all irreducible components of
the special ﬁbers of log-modiﬁcations belonging to M, then the collection of [nontrivial] subgroups of TX of the form “IC ”, where C ∈ C, is of countable cardinality.
Thus, we may, for instance, enumerate the elements of C via the natural numbers

46

so as to obtain a sequence C1 , C2 , . . . [i.e., which includes all elements of C]. Since
Zp , on the other hand, is of uncountable cardinality, we thus conclude that there
exists a surjection
Λ : TX  Λ X
— where ΛX ∼
= Zp — such that the following properties are satisﬁed:
def

(1) For every subgroup IC , where C ∈ C, we have ΛC = Λ(IC ) = {0}.
(2) There exists a stable component C0 of X such that ΛC0 = ΛX .
[For instance, by applying the fact that each ICn has nontrivial image in TX ⊗
Z/pZ, one may construct Λ by constructing inductively on n [a natural number]
an increasing sequence of natural numbers m1 < m2 < . . . such that ICn maps to
a nonzero subgroup of ΛX ⊗ Z/pmn Z.]
Let us refer to a connected ﬁnite étale Galois covering Xη → Xη [which may
only be deﬁned after possibly replacing k by a ﬁnite extension of k] of hyperbolic
curves over η with stable reduction over S as a Λ-covering if the covering Xη ×k k →
Xη ×k k arises from an open subgroup of ΛX ; thus, Gal(Xη /Xη ) may be thought of
as a ﬁnite quotient of ΛX by an open subgroup ΛX  ⊆ ΛX . Note that since every
ΛC , where C ∈ C, is isomorphic to Zp , it follows that the following property also
holds:
(3) For any pair Xη → Xη → Xη of Λ-coverings of Xη such that
 ΛC

∼
has nontrivial image in Gal(Xη /Xη ) = ΛX /ΛX  , it follows that ΛC ΛX 
surjects onto ΛX  /ΛX  — i.e., that the covering Xη → Xη is totally wildly
ramiﬁed over any valuation of the function ﬁeld of Xη whose center on X
is equal to the generic point of C.
Now to complete the proof of assertion (ii), it suﬃces to derive a contradiction upon
making the following two further assumptions:
(4) Every Λ-covering is loop-preserving.
(5) For every Λ-covering Xη → Xη [which extends to a morphism (X  )log →
X log of log stable curves], there exists [after possibly replacing k by a ﬁnite
extension of k] a split, base-ﬁeld-isomorphic log-modiﬁcation V log → X log
such that the morphism Xη → Xη ∼
= Vη ⊆ V extends to a quasi-ﬁnite
morphism from some Zariski neighborhood in X  of the generic points of
X  to V .
[Indeed, if assumption (4) is false, then it follows immediately that condition (a) of
assertion (ii) holds [cf. property (2)]; if assumption (5) is false, then it follows immediately that condition (b) of assertion (ii) holds.] Note, moreover, that assumption
(5) implies the following property:
(6) For every Λ-covering Xη → Xη [which extends to a morphism (X  )log →
X log of log stable curves], there exist [after possibly replacing k by a ﬁnite
extension of k], split, base-ﬁeld-isomorphic log-modiﬁcations (V  )log →

(X  )log , V log → X log , together with a ﬁnite morphism (V  )log → V log
lying over (X  )log → X log .
def

[Indeed, if, in the notation of property (5), one takes (V  )log = V log ×X log (X  )log ,
then the natural projection morphism (V  )log → (X  )log is a split, base-ﬁeldisomorphic log-modiﬁcation. Moreover, every irreducible component of V  maps
ﬁnitely either to some irreducible component of V or to some irreducible component of X  . Thus, by property (5), we conclude that every irreducible component
of V  maps ﬁnitely to some irreducible component of V , hence [by Zariski’s main
theorem] that the natural projection morphism (V  )log → V log is ﬁnite, as desired.]
Next, let us observe that properties (4), (6) imply the following properties:
(7) There exists a Λ-covering Xη → Xη [after possibly replacing k by a ﬁnite
extension of k] such that every ΛC , where C ∈ C, has nontrivial image in
ΛX /ΛX  .
(8) There exist Λ-coverings Xη → Xη → Xη [after possibly replacing k by
a ﬁnite extension of k] such that ΛX  /ΛX ∼
= Z/pZ, and, moreover, for
every ΛC , where C ∈ C, the intersection ΛC ΛX  surjects onto ΛX  /ΛX  .
Indeed, by property (3), it follows that property (8) follows immediately from property (7). To verify property (7), we reason as follows: First, let
Xη† → Xη∗ → Xη
be Λ-coverings [which exist after possibly replacing k by a ﬁnite extension of k]
such that ΛX ∗ /ΛX † is of order p, and ΛC has nontrivial image in ΛX /ΛX ∗ [which
implies that ΛC ΛX ∗ surjects onto ΛX ∗ /ΛX † — cf. property (3)] for every stable
irreducible component C of X; write X †,log → X ∗,log → X log for the resulting
morphisms of log stable curves. [Note that such Λ-coverings exist, precisely because
there are only ﬁnitely many such stable C.] Let V †,log → X †,log , V ∗,log → X ∗,log ,
V log → X log be split, base-ﬁeld-isomorphic log-modiﬁcations such that there exist
ﬁnite, loop-preserving morphisms
V †,log → V ∗,log → V log
lying over X †,log → X ∗,log → X log [cf. properties (4), (6)]. [Thus, V †,log , V ∗,log are
completely determined by V log — i.e., by taking the normalization of V in Xη† , Xη∗ .]
Next, let us observe that every node ν of X determines a simple path γVν in the
dual graph ΓV [i.e., by taking the inverse image of ν in V — cf. Proposition 2.5,
(v)], whose terminal vertices are stable irreducible components of V [but whose nonterminal vertices are non-stable irreducible components of V ]. Thus, by Proposition
2.5, (xi) [which is applicable, in light of properties (4), (6)], it follows that γVν lifts
[uniquely — i.e., once one ﬁxes liftings of the terminal vertices] to simple paths γVν ∗
in ΓV ∗ , γVν † in ΓV † . Since, moreover, Xη† → Xη∗ is totally wildly ramiﬁed over the
terminal vertices of γVν ∗ , it thus follows that we may apply Proposition 2.5, (xii), to
conclude that Xη† → Xη∗ is wildly ramiﬁed at every non-stable vertex of γVν † . Write
B for the set of irreducible components of V [which we think of as valuations of the
function ﬁeld of Xη ×k k] that are the images of stable vertices of γVν † , for nodes ν

48

of X. Observe that if we keep the coverings Xη† → Xη∗ → Xη ﬁxed, but vary the
log-modiﬁcation V log → X log [among, say, elements of M], then the set B remains
unchanged [if we think of B as a set of valuations of the function ﬁeld of Xη ×k k]
and of ﬁnite cardinality [bounded by the cardinality of the set of stable irreducible
components of X † ]. Thus, in summary, if we think of B as a subset of C, then we
may conclude the following:

ΛC
ΛX ∗ surjects onto ΛX ∗ /ΛX † , for all C ∈ C\B.
Since B isﬁnite, it thus follows that there exists a Λ-covering Xη → Xη† → Xη such
that ΛC ΛX † has nontrivial image in ΛX † /ΛX  , for all C ∈ C [cf. property (3)].
This completes the proof of property (7).
Next, let us consider Λ-coverings
Xη → Xη → X
[which exist after possibly replacing k by a ﬁnite extension of k] such that ΛX 
/ΛX 

is of order p, and ΛC has nontrivial image in ΛX /ΛX [which implies that ΛC ΛX 
surjects onto ΛX  /ΛX  — cf. property (3)] for all C ∈ C [cf. property (7)]; write
(X  )log → (X  )log → X log for the resulting morphisms of log stable curves. Let
(V  )log → (X  )log , (V  )log → (X  )log be split, base-ﬁeld-isomorphic, unramiﬁed
log-modiﬁcations such that there exists a ﬁnite, loop-preserving morphism
(V  )log → (V  )log
lying over (X  )log → (X  )log [which exist after possibly replacing k by a ﬁnite
extension of k — cf. properties (4), (6); Proposition 2.5, (iii)].
Next, let us consider the logarithmic derivative
δ : ω(V  )log /S log |V  → ω(V  )log /S log
of the morphism (V  )log → (V  )log . Since this morphism is ﬁnite étale over η,
it follows that δ is an isomorphism over η. On the other hand, since Xη → Xη
is totally wildly ramiﬁed over every irreducible component C of V  [i.e., induces a
purely inseparable extension of degree p of the function ﬁeld of C], it follows that
δ vanishes on the special ﬁber V  . Write δ ∗ = π −n · δ, for the maximal integer n
such that π −n · δ remains integral. Thus, we obtain a morphism
def

δ ∗ : ω(V  )log /S log |V  → ω(V  )log /S log
of line bundles on V  which is not identically zero on V  . Let C  be an irreducible
component of V  such that δ ∗ |C  ≡ 0. Note that since V  has at least one stable
irreducible component, it follows that we may choose C  such that either C  is
stable or C  meets an irreducible component C ∗ of V  such that δ ∗ |C ∗ ≡ 0. Thus,
if C  is not stable, then it follows that δ ∗ |C  has at least one zero [i.e., is not an
isomorphism of line bundles]. Write C  for the irreducible component of V  which
is the image of C  ; E  → C  , E  → C  for the respective normalizations; gE  , gE 
for the respective genera of E  , E  . Also, let us refer to the points of C  , E  , C  ,

TOPICS IN ABSOLUTE ANABELIAN GEOMETRY II

E  that do not map to the respective 1-interiors of (V  )log , (V  )log as critical points.
Write DE  ⊆ E  , DE  ⊆ E  for the respective divisors of critical points; rE  , rE 
for the respective degrees of DE  , DE  .
Next, let us consider the morphism C  → C  . Since this morphism C  → C 
induces a purely inseparable extension of degree p on the respective function ﬁelds,
∼
it follows that we have an isomorphism of k-schemes E  ×k k  → E  [so gE  = gE  ],
where we write k → k  ∼
= k for the [degree one!] ﬁeld extension determined by
the Frobenius morphism on k. Next, I claim that the critical points of C  map to
critical points of C  . Indeed, if a critical point of C  maps to a non-critical point c
of C  , then let us write Cc , Cc for the spectra of the respective completions of the
local rings of C  , C  at [the ﬁber over] c. Then observe that since V  is regular [of
dimension two] at c [cf. Proposition 2.5, (iv)], while V  is the normalization of V 
in Xη , it follows from elementary commutative algebra that V  is ﬁnite and ﬂat
over V  of degree p at c. Thus, if we write ηc for the spectrum of the residue ﬁeld of
the unique generic point of the irreducible scheme Cc , then Cc ×Cc ηc → ηc is ﬁnite,
ﬂat of degree ≤ p; [since Xη → Xη is totally wildly ramiﬁed over every irreducible
component of V  , it follows that] the degree of each of the ≥ 2 [cf. Proposition 2.5,
(vi)] connected components of Cc ×Cc ηc over ηc is equal to p — in contradiction
to the fact that the degree of Cc ×Cc ηc over ηc is ≤ p. This completes the proof of
the claim. In particular, it follows that rE  ≤ rE  .
Now recall that we have natural isomorphisms
∼

ωE  /k (DE  ) → ω(V  )log /S log |E  ;

∼

ωE  /k (DE  ) → ω(V  )log /S log |E 

[cf. Proposition 2.5, (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi); the fact that the log-modiﬁcations
(V  )log → (X  )log , (V  )log → (X  )log are unramiﬁed]. Moreover, it follows immediately from the deﬁnitions that deg(ωE  /k (DE  )) = 2gE  + rE  , deg(ωE  /k (DE  )) =
2gE  +rE  . We thus conclude that deg(ω(V  )log /S log |C  ) ≤ deg(ω(V  )log /S log |C  ). On
the other hand, the existence of the generically nonzero morphism of line bundles
δ ∗ |C  implies that
deg(ω(V  )log /S log |C  ) ≥ deg(ω(V  )log /S log |C  )
= p · deg(ω(V  )log /S log |C  ) ≥ p · deg(ω(V  )log /S log |C  )
— which implies that deg(ω(V  )log /S log |C  ) ≤ 0. Now if C  is stable, then we
have deg(ω(V  )log /S log |C  ) = 2gE  + rE  > 0. We thus conclude that C  is nonstable. But this implies that δ ∗ |C  has at least one zero, so [cf. the above display
of inequalities] we obtain that deg(ω(V  )log /S log |C  ) < 0, in contradiction to the
equality deg(ω(V  )log /S log |C  ) = 0 if C  is non-stable [cf. the proof of Proposition
2.5, (v)]. This completes the proof of assertion (ii). In light of assertion (ii),
assertion (iii) follows immediately from Proposition 2.5, (viii). This completes the
proof of assertion (iii).
Next, we consider assertion (iv). First, let us observe that by Proposition 2.5,
(ix), it follows that we may assume that split, base-ﬁeld-isomorphic log-modiﬁcations
W log → Y log , Qlog → X log , together with a morphism W log → Qlog over Y log →
X log , have been chosen so that the generic point of the unique irreducible compo[1]
nent CW of W that maps ﬁnitely to C maps into UQ . Then observe that there are
precisely two mutually exclusive possibilities:

50

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
[1]

(c) some nonempty open subscheme of C maps quasi-ﬁnitely to UQ ;
[1]

(d) C maps to a closed point c of UQ .
Moreover, by Proposition 2.5, (i), (ii), (vii), it follows immediately that (b) [as
in the statement of assertion (iv)] ⇐⇒ (d). Thus, it suﬃces to show that (a) [as
in the statement of assertion (iv)] ⇐⇒ (d). Note that it is immediate that (d)
implies (a): Indeed, if we write clog for the log scheme obtained by equipping c with
the restriction to c of the log structure of Qlog , then we obtain an open injection
π1 (clog ) → Gklog ; but this implies that the natural homomorphism ΔC → ΔX log
factors through {1} = Ker(π1 (clog ) → Gklog ), hence that condition (a) is satisﬁed.
Thus, it remains to show that (a) implies (d), or, equivalently, that condition
(c) implies that condition (a) fails to hold. But this follows immediately from the
observation that condition (c) implies that ΔC surjects onto an open subgroup of the
decomposition group ΔE in ΔX log of some irreducible component E of Q. Here, we
recall that the following well-known facts: if E is stable, then ΔE may be identiﬁed
 [1]
def
with the maximal pro-l quotient of π1 (UE ×k k), where we write UE = E UQ ,
which is inﬁnite; if E is not stable, then ΔE ∼
= Zl (1) [cf. Proposition 2.5, (v)], hence
inﬁnite. This completes the proof of assertion (iv).
Finally, we consider assertion (v). First, we observe that ΔC may be identiﬁed
 [1]
def
with the maximal pro-l quotient of π1 (UC ×k k), where we write UC = C UY
[and assume, for simplicity, that Y log is split]. In particular, an automorphism of
UC is equal to the identity if and only if it induces the identity outer automorphism
of ΔC [cf., e.g., [MT], Proposition 1.4, and its proof]. Note, moreover, that an
automorphism of Y log stabilizes C if and only if it stabilizes the conjugacy class
of ΔC [cf., e.g., [Mzk13], Proposition 1.2, (i)]. Thus, assertion (v) reduces to the
[easily veriﬁed] assertion that the morphism Yη → Xη is wildly ramiﬁed at C if and
only if Gal(Yη /Xη ) stabilizes and induces the identity on C. This completes the
proof of assertion (v).
Remark 2.6.1. Note that the content of Lemma 2.6, (ii), (iii), is reminiscent
of the main results of [Tama2] [cf. also Corollary 2.11 below]. By comparison to
Tamagawa’s “resolution of nonsingularities”, however, Lemma 2.6, (ii), (iii), assert
a somewhat weaker conclusion, albeit for pro-p geometric fundamental groups, as
opposed to proﬁnite geometric fundamental groups.
Remark 2.6.2. The argument applied in the ﬁnal portion of the proof of Lemma
2.6, (ii), is reminiscent of the well-known classical argument that implies the nonexistence of a Frobenius lifting for stable curves over the ring of Witt vectors of a ﬁnite
ﬁeld. That is to say, if k is absolutely unramiﬁed, and
Φ:X→X
is an S-morphism that induces the Frobenius morphism between the respective special ﬁbers, then one obtains a contradiction as follows: Since Φ induces a morphism
Xη → Xη , it follows immediately that Φ extends to a morphism of log stable curves
Φlog : X log → X log . Although the derivative
dΦlog : Φ∗ (ωX log /S log ) → ωX log /S log

TOPICS IN ABSOLUTE ANABELIAN GEOMETRY II

51

is ≡ 0 (mod p), one veriﬁes immediately [by an easy local calculation] that p1 dΦlog
is necessarily ≡ 0 (mod p) generically on each irreducible component of X. Since
ωX log /S log is a line bundle of degree 2gX − 2, and Φ reduces to the Frobenius morphism between the special ﬁbers, the existence of dΦlog thus implies [by taking
degrees] that p · (2gX − 2) ≤ 2gX − 2, i.e., that (p − 1)(2gX − 2) ≤ 0, in contradiction to the fact that gX ≥ 2.
Remark 2.6.3. Note that it follows immediately from either of the conditions
(a), (b) of Lemma 2.6, (ii), that Y is not k-smooth [i.e., “singular”].
Corollary 2.7. (Uniformly Toral Neighborhoods via Cyclic Coverings)
Suppose that we are either in the situation of Lemma 2.6, (ii), (a) — which we
shall refer to in the following as case (a) — or in the situation of Lemma 2.6,
(ii), (b) — which we shall refer to in the following as case (b); suppose further, in
case (b), that X is not smooth over k. Also, we suppose that we have been given
a commutative diagram as in Lemma 2.6, (iii). Thus, in either case, we have an
irreducible component CW of W [lying over an irreducible component C of Y ]
[1]
satisfying certain special properties, as in Lemma 2.6, (iii). Let y ∈ UW (Ok ) (⊆
Wη (k) = Yη (k)) be a point such that the image of y meets CW , and, moreover, y

exists a positive integer M — which, in fact, may be taken to be 1 in case (b) —
such that the following condition holds: Let k• ⊆ k be a ﬁnite extension of k with
ring of integers Ok• , maximal ideal mk• ⊆ Ok• . Write Ik• for the image in J(Ok• )
via β [cf. (ii)] of the product of gY copies of Uy (Ok• ). Then M · Ik• lies in the

Proof. First, we consider assertion (i). Recall from the well-known theory of Néron
models of Jacobians [cf., e.g., [BLR], §9.2, Example 8] that the torus portion of the
special ﬁber of J Y (respectively, J X ) is [in the notation of Proposition 2.5, (vi)]
of rank lp-rk(Y ) (respectively, lp-rk(X)). In particular, the torus portion of the
special ﬁber of J is of rank lp-rk(Y ) − lp-rk(X) in case (a), and of rank lp-rk(X)
in case (b). Thus, in case (a), the fact that the morphism Yη → Xη is loopifying
implies that the torus portion of the special ﬁber of J is of positive rank; in case (b),
since X is not k-smooth, it follows from the loop-ampleness assumption of Lemma
2.6 that lp-rk(X) > 0, hence that the torus portion of the special ﬁber of J is of
positive rank. Now the existence of an exact sequence as in assertion (i) follows from
the well-known theory of degeneration of abelian varieties [cf., e.g., [FC], Chapter
III, Corollary 7.3]. This completes the proof of assertion (i).

TOPICS IN ABSOLUTE ANABELIAN GEOMETRY II

Next, we consider assertion (ii). The existence of the unique extension of ιYη
follows immediately from Proposition 2.5, (x); the existence of the unique extension
of βη follows immediately from the existence of this unique extension of ιYη [together
with the existence of the homomorphism of semi-abelian schemes κ : J Y → J]. In
case (b), the existence of the morphism Uy → Ux follows immediately from the
deﬁnitions. In case (a), if the morphism Uy → Ux fails to exist, then there exists a
[1]
closed point w ∈ W that maps to a closed point q ∈ Q such that w ∈ Uy ⊆ UW , but
[1]
q ∈ UQ . On the other hand, since there exists an irreducible Zariski neighborhood
of w in W [cf. the simple structure of the monoid N], it follows from the fact
that CW maps ﬁnitely to CQ [in case (a)], that W → Q is quasi-ﬁnite in a Zariski
neighborhood of w. Thus, if we write Rw , Rq for the respective strict henselizations
of W , Q at [some choice of k-valued points lifting] w, q, then Rw , Rq are normal, and
theorem]. In particular,
the natural inclusion Rq → Rw is ﬁnite [cf. Zariski’s main 
×
Kq = Rq× [where “×”
if we write Kq for the quotient ﬁeld of Rq , then we have Rw
denotes the subgroup of units], so the morphism W log → Qlog induces an injection
on the groupiﬁcations of the stalks of the characteristic sheaves at [some choice
[1]
of k-valued points lifting] w, q — in contradiction to the fact that w ∈ UW , but
[1]
q ∈ UQ . This completes the proof of assertion (ii).
Finally, we consider assertion (iii). First, we deﬁne the number M as follows:
In case (a), the endomorphism (1−σ) : J Y → J Y admits a factorization θ◦κ, where
θ : J → J Y is a “closed immersion up to isogeny” [cf., e.g., the situation discussed
in [BLR], §7.5, Proposition 3, (b)] — i.e., there exists a morphism θ : J Y → J
such that θ ◦ θ : J → J is multiplication by some positive integer Mθ on J; then
def
def
we take M = Mθ . In case (b), we take M = 1. In the following, if G is a group
scheme or formal group over Ok , and r ≥ 1 is an integer, then let us write
Gmr (Ok• ) ⊆ G(Ok• )
for the subgroup of elements that are congruent to the identity modulo mrk · Ok• .
Next, let us make the following observation:
(1) We have M · Ik• ⊆ Jm (Ok• ) ⊆ J(Ok• ).
Indeed, in case (a), we reason as follows: It suﬃces to show that M ·κ(ιY (Uy (Ok• ))) ⊆
Jm (Ok• ). Since, moreover, the endomorphism (1 − σ) : J Y → J Y admits a factorization θ ◦ κ, where, for some morphism θ : J Y → J, θ ◦ θ is equal to multiplication
by M , it suﬃces to show that
Y
(Ok• )
(1 − σ)(ιY (Uy (Ok• ))) ⊆ Jm

[since applying θ to this inclusion yields the desired inclusion M ·κ(ιY (Uy (Ok• ))) ⊆
Jm (Ok• )]. On the other hand, since Yη → Xη is wildly ramiﬁed at CW , it follows
that σ acts as the identity on CW , hence that the composite morphism (1 − σ) ◦ ιY :
Uy → J Y induces a morphism on special ﬁbers Uy ×Ok k → J Y ×Ok k that is constant
[with image lying in the image of the identity section of J Y ×Ok k]. But this implies
Y
(Ok• ). This completes the proof of observation (1)
that (1 − σ)(ιY (Uy (Ok• ))) ⊆ Jm
in case (a). In a similar [but slightly simpler] vein, in case (b), it suﬃces to observe

54

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

that the morphism κ ◦ ιY : Uy → J admits a factorization Uy → Ux → J X , where
Uy → Ux is the morphism of assertion (ii), and Ux → J X is the “analogue of ιY ”
for the point x of Xη (k) [cf. Proposition 2.5, (x)]. That is to say, the fact that CW
[1]
maps to x ∈ UQ (Ok ) implies [by applying this factorization] that the morphism
κ ◦ ιY : Uy → J induces a morphism on special ﬁbers Uy ×Ok k → J ×Ok k that is
constant [with image lying in the image of the identity section of J ×Ok k]. This
completes the proof of observation (1) in case (b).
Next, let us make the following observation:
(2) There exists a positive integer r which is independent of k• such that
M · Ik• ⊇ Jmr (Ok• ).
Indeed, since κ is clearly dominant, it follows immediately that the composite of
the morphism β : Uy ×k . . . ×k Uy → J with the morphism J → J given by
multiplication by M is dominant, hence, in particular, generically smooth [since k
is of characteristic zero]. Thus, [since M · Ik• is a group!] observation (2) follows
immediately from the “positive slope version of Hensel’s lemma” given in Lemma


(Ok• ) = Jm (Ok• ) J (Ok• ) [cf. assertion (i)], we conclude that
2.1. Now since Jm

(Ok• )

[cf. the inclusions of observations (1), (2)], so assertion (iii) follows essentially
formally [cf. [Mzk15], Deﬁnition 3.6, (i), (ii)]. This completes the proof of assertion
(iii).
Remark 2.7.1. Note that in the situation of case (b), if f is a rational function
on X whose value at x lies in Ok× , then the values ∈ Ok×• of f at points of Uy (Ok• )
[cf. the notation of Corollary 2.7, (iii)] determine a uniformly toral neighborhood.
It was precisely this observation that motivated the author to develop the theory
of the present §2.
Deﬁnition 2.8.
k.

Let k be a ﬁeld of characteristic zero, k an algebraic closure of

(i) Suppose that k is equipped with a topology. Let X be a smooth, geometrically connected curve over k. Then we shall say that a subset
Ξ ⊆ X(k) is



Galois-dense if, for every ﬁnite extension ﬁeld k ⊆ k of k, Ξ X(k ) is dense in
X(k  ) [i.e., relative to the topology induced on X(k  ) by k].
(ii) We shall refer to as a pro-curve U over k [cf. the terminology of [Mzk3]]
any k-scheme U that may be written as a projective limit of smooth, geometrically
connected curves over k in which the transition morphisms are birational. Let U be
a pro-curve over k. Then it makes sense to speak of the function ﬁeld k(U ) of U .
Write X for the smooth, proper, geometrically connected curve over k determined
by the function ﬁeld k(U ). Then one veriﬁes immediately that U is completely
determined up to unique isomorphism by k(U ), together with some Gal(k/k)-stable
subset Ξ ⊆ X(k) — i.e., roughly speaking, “U is obtained by removing Ξ from X”.

TOPICS IN ABSOLUTE ANABELIAN GEOMETRY II

55

If k is equipped with a topology, then we shall say that U is co-Galois-dense if the
corresponding Gal(k/k)-stable subset Ξ ⊆ X(k) is Galois-dense.
Remark 2.8.1. Suppose, in the notation of Deﬁnition 2.8, that k is an MLF
[and that k is equipped with the p-adic topology]. Let X be a smooth, proper,
geometrically connected curve over k, with function ﬁeld k(X). Then Spec(k(X))
is a co-Galois-dense pro-curve over k. Suppose that X = X0 ×k0 k, where k0 ⊆ k is
a number ﬁeld, and X0 is a smooth, proper, geometrically connected curve over k0 ,
with function ﬁeld k(X0 ). Then Spec(k(X0 ) ⊗k0 k) [where we note that the ring
k(X0 ) ⊗k0 k is not a ﬁeld!] also forms an example of a co-Galois-dense pro-curve
over k.
Remark 2.8.2. Let k be a ﬁeld of characteristic zero.
(i) Let us say that a pro-curve U over k is of unit type if there exists a connected
ﬁnite étale covering of U that admits a nonconstant unit. Thus, any hyperbolic
curve U over k for which there exists a connected ﬁnite étale covering V → U such
that V admits a dominant k-morphism V → P , where P is the projective line minus
three points over k, is of unit type. That is to say, the hyperbolic curves considered
in [Mzk15], Remark 3.8.1 — i.e., the sort of hyperbolic curves that motivated the
author to prove [Mzk15], Corollary 3.8, (g) — are necessarily of unit type.
(ii) Suppose that k is an MLF of residue characteristic p, whose ring of integers
we denote by Ok . Let n ≥ 1 be an integer; η ∈ Ok /(pn ). Then observe that the
set E of elements of Ok that are ≡ η (mod pn ) is of uncountable cardinality. In
particular, it follows that the subﬁeld of k generated over Q by E is of uncountable
— hence, in particular, inﬁnite — transcendence degree over Q.
(iii) Let k be as in (ii); X0 a proper hyperbolic curve over k0 , where k0 ⊆ k is a
ﬁnitely generated extension of Q; k1 ⊆ k a ﬁnitely generated extension of k0 ; r ≥ 1
an integer. Then recall from [MT], Corollary 5.7, that any curve U1 obtained by
def

removing from X1 = X0 ×k0 k1 a set of r “generic points” ∈ X1 (k1 ) = X0 (k1 ) —
i.e., r points which determine a dominant morphism from Spec(k1 ) to the product
of r copies of X0 over k0 — is not of unit-type. In particular, it follows immediately
from (ii) that:
There exist co-Galois-dense pro-curves U over k which are not of unit type.
For more on the signiﬁcance of this fact, we refer to Remark 2.10.1 below.
Remark 2.8.3.
Suppose that we are in the situation of Deﬁnition 2.8, (i).
Let Y → X be a connected ﬁnite étale covering. Then one veriﬁes immediately,
by applying “Krasner’s Lemma” [cf. [Kobl], pp. 69-70], that the inverse image
Ξ|Y ⊆ Y (k) of a Galois-dense subset Ξ ⊆ X(k) is itself Galois-dense.

Corollary 2.9.
(Point-theoreticity Implies Geometricity) For i = 1, 2,
let ki be an MLF of residue characteristic pi ; k i an algebraic closure of ki ; Σi a
set of primes of cardinality ≥ 2 such that pi ∈ Σi ; Xi a hyperbolic curve over
ki ; X i the smooth, proper, geometrically connected curve over ki determined by the
function ﬁeld of Xi ; Ξi ⊆ X i (k i ) a Galois-dense subset. Write “π1 (−)” for the
étale fundamental group of a connected scheme, relative to an appropriate choice of
basepoint; ΔXi for the maximal pro-Σi quotient of π1 (Xi ×ki k i ); ΠXi for the
quotient of π1 (Xi ) by the kernel of the natural surjection π1 (Xi ×ki k i )  ΔXi . Let
∼

α : ΠX1 → ΠX2
be an isomorphism of proﬁnite groups such that a closed subgroup of ΠX1 is a
decomposition group of a point ∈ Ξ1 if and only if it corresponds, relative to α, to
a decomposition group in ΠX2 of a point ∈ Ξ2 . Then p1 = p2 , Σ1 = Σ2 , and α is
∼
geometric, i.e., arises from a unique isomorphism of schemes X1 → X2 .
Proof. First, we observe that by [Mzk15], Theorem 2.14, (i), α induces iso∼
∼
morphisms αΔ : ΔX1 → ΔX2 , αG : G1 → G2 [where, for i = 1, 2, we write
def

def

Gi = Gal(k i /ki )]; p1 = p2 [so we shall write p = p1 = p2 ]; Σ1 = Σ2 [so we shall
def

write Σ = Σ1 = Σ2 ]. Also, by [the portion concerning semi-graphs of] [Mzk15],
Theorem 2.14, (i), it follows that α preserves the decomposition groups of cusps.
Thus, by passing to corresponding open subgroups of ΠXi [cf. Remark 2.8.3] and
forming the quotient by the decomposition groups of cusps in ΔXi , we may assume,
without loss of generality, that the Xi are proper. Next, let l ∈ Σ be a prime = p.
Then let us recall that by the well-known stable reduction criterion [cf., e.g., [BLR],
§7.4, Theorem 6], Xi has stable reduction over Oki if and only if, for some Zl ab
submodule M ⊆ Δab
Xi ⊗ Zl of the maximal pro-l abelian quotient ΔXi ⊗ Zl of ΔXi ,
the inertia subgroup of Gi acts trivially on M , Δab
Xi ⊗ Zl /M . Thus, we may assume,
without loss of generality, that, for i = 1, 2, Xi admits a log stable model Xilog over
Spec(Oki )log [where the last log structure is the log structure determined by the
closed point]. Since, by [the portion concerning semi-graphs of] [Mzk15], Theorem
2.14, (i), it follows that α induces an isomorphism between the dual graphs of the
special ﬁbers X i of the Xi , hence that X 1 is loop-ample (respectively, singular) if
and only if X 2 is. Thus, by replacing Xi by a ﬁnite étale covering of Xi arising
from an open subgroup of ΠXi , we may assume that X i is loop-ample [cf. §0] and
singular [cf. Remark 2.6.3]. Now, to complete the proof of Corollary 2.9, it follows
from [Mzk15], Corollary 3.8, (e), that it suﬃces to show that αG is uniformly toral.
Next, let us suppose that, for i = 1, 2, we are given a ﬁnite étale covering
Yi → Xi of hyperbolic curves over ki with stable reduction over Oki arising from
open subgroups of ΠXi that correspond via α and are such that Gal(Yi /Xi ) is cyclic
of order a positive power of p [cf. Lemma 2.6, (ii)]. Let us write Yilog for the log
stable model of Yi over (Oki )log , Y i for the special ﬁber of Yi . By possibly replacing
the ki by corresponding [relative to α] ﬁnite extensions of ki , we may assume that
the Yi are split [cf. Proposition 2.5, (vi)]. Note that by [the portion concerning
semi-graphs of] [Mzk15], Theorem 2.14, (i), it follows that Y1 → X1 is loopifying if
and only if Y2 → X2 is. Thus, by Lemma 2.6, (iv), (v) [cf. also Proposition 2.5, (i),
(ii)] (respectively, Lemma 2.6, (iv)), it follows that Y1 → X1 satisﬁes condition (a)

TOPICS IN ABSOLUTE ANABELIAN GEOMETRY II

57

(respectively, (b)) of Lemma 2.6, (ii), if and if Y2 → X2 does. For i = 1, 2, let Ci
be an irreducible component of Y i as in Corollary 2.7 [i.e., “C”]. By Lemma 2.6,
(iv) [cf. also the portion concerning semi-graphs of [Mzk15], Theorem 2.14, (i)],
we may assume that the Ci are compatible with α. Thus, to complete the proof of
Corollary 2.9, it suﬃces to construct uniformly toral neighborhoods [cf. Corollary
2.7, (iii)] that are compatible with α.
Write ΠYi ⊆ ΠXi , ΔYi ⊆ ΔXi for the open subgroups determined by Yi ; TiY ,
TiX for the maximal pro-p abelian quotients of ΔYi , ΔXi . If we are in case (a)
[cf. Corollary 2.7], then we choose generators σi ∈ Gal(Yi /Xi ) ∼
= ΔXi /ΔYi that
correspond via α and write Ti for the intersection with TiY of the image of the
endomorphism (1 − σi ) of TiY ⊗ Qp , and
κTi : TiY → Ti
for the morphism induced by (1 − σi ). If we are in case (b) [cf. Corollary 2.7], then
def

we set Ti = TiX ; write κTi : TiY → Ti for the morphism induced by Yi → Xi [i.e.,
by the inclusion ΔYi → ΔXi ]. Thus, the formal group “J  ” of Corollary 2.7, (i),
corresponds to a Gi -submodule Ti ⊆ Ti such that Ti ∼
= Zp (1); by [Tate], Theorem
4 [cf. also [Mzk5], Proposition 1.2.1, (vi)], we may assume that these submodules
Ti are compatible with α.
(l)

(l)

(l)

Next, let us write ΔYi  ΔYi for the maximal pro-l quotient of ΔYi ; ΔCi ⊆ ΔYi
(l)

for the decomposition group of Ci in ΔYi [well-deﬁned up to conjugation]. Thus,
(l)

ΔCi may be identiﬁed with the maximal pro-l quotient of π1 (UCi ×ki k i ), where
 [1]
def
UCi = Ci UYi [cf. the proof of Lemma 2.6, (iv)], k i is the residue ﬁeld of ki ,
(l)

and k i is the algebraic closure of k i induced by k i . Since ΔCi is slim [cf., e.g.,
(l)

[MT], Proposition 1.4], and the outer action of Gi on ΔCi clearly factors through
(l)

the quotient Gi  Gal(k i /k i ), the resulting outer action of Gal(k i /k i ) on ΔCi
determines, in a fashion that is compatible with α, an extension of proﬁnite groups
(l)
(l)
1 → ΔCi → ΠCi → Gal(k i /k i ) → 1. In a similar vein, the outer action of Gi

on ΔYi factors through the maximal tamely ramiﬁed quotient Gi  Gklog , hence

[since ΔYi is slim — cf., e.g., [MT], Proposition 1.4] determines, in a fashion that

— in which the vertical morphisms are inclusions, and the vertical morphism on

morphisms are equal to the respective decomposition groups of Ci [well-deﬁned up
to conjugation].
Next, let us observe that, by our assumption concerning decomposition groups
of points ∈ Ξi in the statement of Corollary 2.9, it follows that α determines
∼
a bijection Y1 (k1 , Ξ1 ) → Y2 (k2 , Ξ2 ), where we write Yi (ki , Ξi ) ⊆ Yi (ki ) for the

58

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

subset of points lying over points ∈ Ξi . [Here, we recall that a point ∈ Yi (ki )
is uniquely determined by the conjugacy class of its decomposition group in ΠYi
— cf., e.g., [Mzk3], Theorem C.] Now let us choose corresponding [i.e., via this
bijection] points yi ∈ Yi (ki , Ξi ) as our points “y” in the construction of the uniformly
toral neighborhoods of Corollary 2.7, (iii). Here, we observe that [by our Galoisdensity assumption] we may assume that yi is compatible with Ci , in the sense
(l)
that the image in the quotient ΠYi  ΠYi of the decomposition group of yi in
(l)

ΠYi determines a subgroup of ΠCi ×Gal(k /k ) Gklog which contains the kernel of
i

(l)

(l)

i

i

the surjection ΠCi ×Gal(k /k ) Gklog  ΠCi . Note that this condition that yi be

i
“compatible with Ci ” is manifestly “group-theoretic”, i.e., compatible with α [cf. the
portion concerning semi-graphs of [Mzk15], Theorem 2.14, (i); [Mzk5], Proposition
1.2.1, (ii)]. Moreover, let us recall from the theory of §1 that this condition that yi
be “compatible with Ci ” is equivalent to the condition that the closure in Yi of yi
intersect UCi [cf. Proposition 1.3, (x)].
Thus, by choosing any corresponding [i.e., via the bijection induced by α]
points yi ∈ Yi (ki , Ξi ) that are compatible with the Ci , we may compute [directly
from the decomposition groups of the yi , yi in ΠYi ] the “diﬀerence” of yi , yi in
H 1 (Gki , TiY ), as well as the image
δyi ,yi ∈ H 1 (Gki , Ti )
of this diﬀerence via κTi . On the other hand, let us recall the Kummer isomorphisms
H 1 (Gki , Ti ) ∼
= Ok×i ⊗ Zp ;

H 1 (Gki , Ti ) ∼
= Ji (ki ) ⊗ Zp

[where Ji is the “J” of Corollary 2.7, (iii) — cf., e.g., the “well-known general
nonsense” reviewed in the proof of [Mzk14], Proposition 2.2, (i), for more details].
By applying these isomorphisms, we conclude that the subset of
H 1 (Gki , Ti ⊗ Qp ) ∼
= Ok×i ⊗ Qp
obtained by taking the image of the intersection in H 1 (Gki , Ti ) with the image of
H 1 (Gki , Ti ) of the closure [cf. our Galois-density assumption, together with the
evident p-adic continuity of the assignment yi → δyi ,yi ] of the set obtained by
adding gYi [where gYi is the genus of Yi ] elements of the form Mi · δyi ,yi [where Mi
is the “M ” of Corollary 2.7, (iii)] yields — from the point of view of Corollary 2.7,
(iii) — a subset that coincides with the subset “Nk• ” [when “k• ” is taken to be ki ]
constructed in Corollary 2.7, (iii). Thus, by allowing the “ki ” to vary over arbitrary
corresponding ﬁnite extensions ⊆ k i of ki , we obtain uniform toral neighborhoods
of the Gi that are compatible with α. But this implies that αG is uniformly toral,
hence completes the proof of Corollary 2.9.
Remark 2.9.1. Corollary 2.9 may be regarded as a generalization of the [MLF
portion of] [Mzk14], Corollary 2.2, to the case of pro-Σ [where Σ is of cardinality
≥ 2 and contains the residue characteristic — that is to say, Σ is not necessarily the
set of all primes] geometric fundamental groups of not necessarily aﬃne hyperbolic
curves. From this point of view, it is interesting to note that in the theory of the

TOPICS IN ABSOLUTE ANABELIAN GEOMETRY II

59

present §2, Lemma 2.6, which, as is discussed in Remark 2.6.2, is reminiscent of a
classical argument on the “nonexistence of Frobenius liftings”, takes the place of
Lemma 4.7 of [Tama1], which is applied in [Mzk14], Corollary 2.1, to reconstruct
the additive structure of the ﬁelds involved. In this context, we observe that the
appearance of “Frobenius endomorphisms” in Remark 2.6.2 is interesting in light of
the discussion of “hidden endomorphisms” in the Introduction, in which “Frobenius
endomorphisms” also appear.
Remark 2.9.2. One way to think of Corollary 2.9 is as the statement that:
The “Section Conjecture” over MLF’s implies the “absolute isomorphism
version of the Grothendieck Conjecture” over MLF’s.
Here, we recall that in the notation of Corollary 2.9, the “Section Conjecture”
over MLF’s amounts to the assertion that every closed subgroup of ΠXi that maps
isomorphically to an open subgroup of Gal(k i /ki ) is the decomposition group associated to a closed point of Xi . In fact, in order to apply Corollary 2.9, a “relatively
weak version of the Section Conjecture” is suﬃcient — cf. the point of view of
[Mzk8].
Remark 2.9.3. The issue of verifying the “point-theoreticity hypothesis” of Corollary 2.9 [i.e., the hypothesis concerning the preservation of decomposition groups
of closed points] may be thought of as consisting of two steps, as follows:
(a) First, one must show the J-geometricity [cf. [Mzk3], Deﬁnition 4.3] of
the image via α of a decomposition group Dξ ⊆ ΠX1 of a closed point ξ ∈
X1 (k1 ). Once one shows this J-geometricity for all ﬁnite étale coverings of
X2 arising from open subgroups of ΠX2 , one concludes [cf. the arguments
of [Mzk3], §7, §8] that there exist rational points of a certain tower of
coverings of X2 determined by α(Dξ ) ⊆ ΠX2 over tame extensions of k2 .
(b) Finally, one must show that these rational points over tame extensions
of k2 necessarily converge — an issue that the author typically refers to
by the term “tame convergence”.
At the time of writing, it is not clear to the author how to complete either of
these two steps. On the other hand, in the “birational” — or, more generally, the
“co-Galois-dense” — case, one has Corollary 2.10 [given below].
Remark 2.9.4.
(i) By contrast to the quite substantial diﬃculty [discussed in Remark 2.9.3]
of verifying “point-theoreticity” for hyperbolic curves over MLF’s, in the case of
hyperbolic curves over ﬁnite ﬁelds, there is a [relatively simple] “group-theoretic”
algorithm for reconstructing the decomposition groups of closed points, which follows
essentially from the theory of [Tama1] [cf. [Tama1], Corollary 2.10, Proposition 3.8].
Such an algorithm is discussed in [Mzk14], Remark 10, although the argument given
there is somewhat sketchy and a bit misleading. A more detailed presentation may
be found in [SdTm], Corollary 1.25.

(ii) A more concise version of this argument, along the lines of [Mzk14], Remark
10, may be given as follows: Let X be a proper [for simplicity] hyperbolic curve over
a ﬁnite ﬁeld k, with algebraic closure k; Σ a set of prime numbers that contains a
prime that is invertible in k; π1 (X ×k k)  ΔX the maximal pro-Σ quotient of the
étale fundamental group π1 (X ×k k) of X ×k k; π1 (X)  ΠX the corresponding
def

quotient of the étale fundamental group π1 (X) of X; ΠX  Gk = Gal(k/k) the
natural quotient. Then it suﬃces to give a “group-theoretic” characterization of
the quasi-sections D ⊆ ΠX [i.e., closed subgroups that map isomorphically onto an
open subgroup of Gk ] which are decomposition groups of closed points of X. Write
 →X
X
for the pro-ﬁnite étale covering corresponding to ΠX . If E ⊆ ΠX is a closed
subgroup whose image in Gk is open, then let us write kE for the ﬁnite extension
ﬁeld of k determined by this image. If J ⊆ ΠX is an open subgroup, then let us write

def
XJ → X for the covering determined by J and JΔ = J ΔX . If J ⊆ ΠX is an open
subgroup such that JΔ is a characteristic subgroup of ΔX , then we shall say that
J is geometrically characteristic. Now let J ⊆ ΠX be a geometrically characteristic
open subgroup. Let us refer to as a descent-group for J any open subgroup H ⊆ ΠX
such that J ⊆ H, JΔ = HΔ . Thus, a descent-group H for J may be thought of as
an intermediate covering XJ → XH → X such that XH ×kH kJ ∼
= XJ . Write
XJ (kJ )ﬂd-def ⊆ XJ (kJ )
for the subset of kJ -valued points of XJ that do not arise from points ∈ XH (kH ) for
any descent-group H = J for J — i.e., the kJ -valued points whose ﬁeld of deﬁnition
is kJ with respect to all possible “descended forms” of XJ . [That is to say, this
deﬁnition of “ﬂd-def” diﬀers slightly from the deﬁnition of “ﬂd-def” in [Mzk14],
 that maps to x ∈ XJ (kJ ), and we
Remark 10.] Thus, if x
 is a closed point of X
⊆ ΠX for the stabilizer in ΠX [i.e., “decomposition group”] of x
, then it
write D
x
def

· JΔ (⊇ J) [so Hx
is a tautology that x maps to a point ∈ XHx (kHx ) for Hx = D
x
forms a descent-group for J]; in particular, it follows immediately that:
x ∈ XJ (kJ )ﬂd-def

⇐⇒ D
⊆J
x

⇐⇒

Hx = J.

Now it follows immediately from this characterization of “ﬂd-def” that if J1 ⊆ J2 ⊆
ΠX are geometrically characteristic open subgroups such that kJ1 = kJ2 , then the
natural map XJ1 (kJ1 ) → XJ2 (kJ2 ) induces a map XJ1 (kJ1 )ﬂd-def → XJ2 (kJ2 )ﬂd-def .
Moreover, these considerations allow one to conclude [cf. the theory of [Tama1]]
that:
A quasi-section D ⊆ ΠX is a decomposition group of a closed point of X
if and and only if, for every geometrically characteristic open subgroup
J ⊆ ΠX such that D · JΔ = J, it holds that XJ (kJ )ﬂd-def = ∅.
Thus, to render this characterization of decomposition groups “group-theoretic”, it
suﬃces to give a “group-theoretic” criterion for the condition that XJ (kJ )ﬂd-def = ∅.
In [Tama1], the Lefschetz trace formula is applied to compute the cardinality of

TOPICS IN ABSOLUTE ANABELIAN GEOMETRY II

61

XJ (kJ ). On the other hand, if we use the notation “| − |” to denote the cardinality
of a ﬁnite set, then one veriﬁes immediately that

|XH (kH )ﬂd-def |
|XJ (kJ )| =
H

— where H ⊇ J ranges over the descent-groups for J. In particular, by applying
induction on [ΠX : J], one concludes immediately from the above formula that
|XJ (kJ )ﬂd-def | may be computed from the |XH (kH )|, as H ranges over the descentgroups for J [while |XH (kH )| may be computed, as in [Tama1], from the Lefschetz
trace formula]. This yields the desired “group-theoretic” characterization of the
decomposition groups of ΠX .
Corollary 2.10.
(Geometricity of Absolute Isomorphisms for CoGalois-dense Pro-curves) For i = 1, 2, let ki be an MLF of residue characteristic pi ; k i an algebraic closure of ki ; Σi a set of primes of cardinality ≥ 2
such that pi ∈ Σi ; Ui a co-Galois-dense pro-curve over ki . Write “π1 (−)” for
the étale fundamental group of a connected scheme, relative to an appropriate choice
of basepoint; ΔUi for the maximal pro-Σi quotient of π1 (Ui ×ki k i ); ΠUi for the
quotient of π1 (Ui ) by the kernel of the natural surjection π1 (Ui ×ki k i )  ΔUi . Let
∼

α : ΠU1 → ΠU2
be an isomorphism of proﬁnite groups. Then ΔUi , ΠUi are slim; p1 = p2 ;
Σ1 = Σ2 ; α is geometric, i.e., arises from a unique isomorphism of schemes
∼
U1 → U 2 .
Proof. First, we observe that Σi may be characterized as the set of primes l
such that ΠUi has l-cohomological dimension > 2. Thus, Σ1 = Σ2 . Let us write
def

Σ = Σ1 = Σ2 ; Xi for the smooth, proper, geometrically connected curve over ki
determined by Ui ; ΔXi for the maximal pro-Σ quotient of π1 (Xi ×ki k i ); ΠXi for
the quotient of π1 (Xi ) by Ker(π1 (Xi ×ki k i )  ΔXi ). Thus, Ui determines some
Galois-dense subset Ξi ⊆ Xi (k i ). Since ΔUi , ΠUi may be written as inverse limits
of surjections of slim proﬁnite groups [cf., e.g., [Mzk15], Proposition 2.3], it follows
that ΔUi , ΠUi are slim. Since the kernel of the natural surjection ΠUi  ΠXi
is topologically generated by the inertia groups of points ∈ Ξi , and these inertia

groups are isomorphic to Z
 Σ for the maximal pro-Σ quotient of Z]
 in a fashion that is compatible with the

conjugation action of some open subgroup of Gi = Gal(k i /ki ), it follows that we

on torsion-free abelianizations. In particular, it follows [in light of our assumptions
on Σi ] that, in the notation of [Mzk15], Theorem 2.6,

{δp1 (ΠUi ) − δp1 (ΠUi )} = sup

— cf. [Mzk15], Theorem 2.6, (ii). In particular, by applying this chain of equalities
to arbitrary open subgroups of ΠUi , we conclude that α induces an isomorphism
∼
αG : G1 → G2 . Moreover, by [Mzk5], Proposition 1.2.1, (i), (vi), the existence of
def

αG implies that p1 = p2 [so we set p = p1 = p2 ], and αG is compatible with the
respective cyclotomic characters.
Let M be a proﬁnite abelian group equipped with a continuous H-action, for
H ⊆ Gi [where i ∈ {1, 2}] an open subgroup. Then let us write M  Q (M ) for the
quotient of M by the closed subgroup generated by the quasi-toral subgroups of M
[i.e., closed subgroups isomorphic as J-modules, for J ⊆ H an open subgroup, to
Zl (1) for some prime l]; M  Q (M )  Q(M ) for the maximal torsion-free quotient
of Q (M ). Also, if M is topologically ﬁnitely generated, then let us write M 
T (M ) for the maximal torsion-free quasi-trivial quotient [i.e., maximal torsion-free
quotient on which H acts through a ﬁnite quotient]. Then one veriﬁes immediately
that the assignments M → Q(M ), M → T (M ) are functorial. Moreover, it follows
from the observations of the preceding paragraph that the natural surjection ΔUi 
 Δab-t
ΔXi determines a surjection on torsion-free abelianizations Δab-t
Ui
Xi that
∼
ab-t
ab-t
induces an isomorphism Q(ΔUi ) → Q(ΔXi ). Thus, it follows from “Poincaré

duality” [i.e., the isomorphism Δab-t
Xi → Hom(ΔXi , Z(1)) determined by the cupproduct on the étale cohomology of X] that
ab-t
2gXi = dimQl (Q(Δab-t
Xi ) ⊗ Ql ) + dimQl (T (ΔXi ) ⊗ Ql )
ab-t
= dimQl (Q(Δab-t
Xi ) ⊗ Ql ) + dimQl (T (Q(ΔXi )) ⊗ Ql )
ab-t
= dimQl (Q(Δab-t
Ui ) ⊗ Ql ) + dimQl (T (Q(ΔUi )) ⊗ Ql )

— where gXi is the genus of Xi , and l ∈ Σ. Thus, we conclude that gX1 = gX2 . In
particular, by passing to corresponding [i.e., via α] open subgroups of the ΠUi , we
may assume that gX1 = gX2 ≥ 2.
Next, by applying this equality “gX1 = gX2 ” to corresponding [i.e., via α] open
subgroups of the ΠUi , it follows from the Hurwitz formula that the condition on
a pair of open subgroups Ji ⊆ Hi ⊆ ΔUi that “the covering between Ji and Hi
be cyclic of order a power of a prime number and totally ramiﬁed at precisely one
closed point but unramiﬁed elsewhere” is preserved by α. Thus, it follows formally
[cf., e.g., the latter portion of the proof of [Mzk5], Lemma 1.3.9] that α preserves the
inertia groups of points ∈ Ξi . Moreover, by considering the conjugation action of
ΠUi on these inertia groups, we conclude that α preserves the decomposition groups
∼
⊆ ΠUi of points ∈ Ξi . Thus, in summary, α induces an isomorphism ΠX1 → ΠX2
that preserves the decomposition groups ⊆ ΠXi of points ∈ Ξi ; in particular, by
∼
applying Corollary 2.9 to this isomorphism ΠX1 → ΠX2 , we obtain an isomorphism
∼
of schemes U1 → U2 , as desired. This completes the proof of Corollary 2.10.
Remark 2.10.1. Thus, by contrast to the results of [Mzk14], Corollary 2.3, or
[Mzk15], Corollary 3.8, (g) [cf. [Mzk15], Remark 3.8.1] — or, indeed, Corollary
1.11, (iii) of the present paper — Corollary 2.10 constitutes the ﬁrst “absolute
isomorphism version of the Grothendieck Conjecture over MLF’s” known to the
author that does not rely on the use of Belyi maps. One aspect of this independence
of the theory of Belyi maps may be seen in the fact that Corollary 2.10 may be

TOPICS IN ABSOLUTE ANABELIAN GEOMETRY II

63

applied to pro-curves which are not of unit type [cf. Remark 2.8.2, (i), (iii)]. Another
aspect of this independence of the theory of Belyi maps may be seen in the fact
that Corollary 2.10 involves geometrically pro-Σ arithmetic fundamental groups for
Σ which are not necessarily equal to the set of all prime numbers.
Finally, we observe that the techniques developed in the present §2 allow one
to give a more pedestrian treatment of the [somewhat sketchy] treatment given
in [Mzk9] [cf. the veriﬁcation of “observation (iv)” given in the proof of [Mzk9],
Corollary 3.11, as well as Remark 2.11.1 below] of the fact that “cusps always appear
as images of nodes”.
Corollary 2.11.
(Cusps as Images of Nodes) Let k be a complete discretely valued ﬁeld of characteristic zero, with perfect residue ﬁeld k of chardef
acteristic p > 0 and ring of integers OK ; η = Spec(k); S log the log scheme obtained
def

by equipping S = Spec(OK ) with the log structure determined by the closed point
def

S = Spec(k) of S; X log → S log a stable log curve over S log such that the underlying scheme of the generic ﬁber X log ×S η is smooth; ξ ∈ X(S) a cusp of the
stable log curve X log ; ξ ∈ X(S) the restriction of ξ to the special ﬁber X of X. In
the following, we shall denote restrictions to η by means of a subscript η; also we
shall often identify ξ with its image in X. Then, after possibly replacing k by a
ﬁnite extension of k, there exists a morphism of stable log curves over S log
φlog : Y log → X log
such that the following properties are satisﬁed:
log
(a) the restriction φlog
→ Xηlog is a ﬁnite log étale Galois covering;
η : Yη

(b) ξ is the image of a node of the special ﬁber Y of Y ;
(c) ξ is the image of an irreducible component of Y .
If, moreover, X is sturdy, loop-ample, and singular, then φη : Yη → Xη may
be taken to be ﬁnite étale of degree p.
Proof. By replacing k by an appropriate subﬁeld of k, one veriﬁes immediately
that we may assume that k is of countable cardinality, hence that k satisﬁes the
hypotheses of the discussion preceding Lemma 2.6. After possibly replacing k by a
ﬁnite extension of k and Xηlog by a ﬁnite log étale Galois covering of Xηlog [which,
in fact, may be taken to be of degree a power of p · l, where l is a prime = p], we
may assume that X is sturdy [cf. §0], loop-ample [cf. §0], singular [cf. Remark
2.6.3], and split. Next, let us recall from the well-known theory of pointed stable
curves [cf. [Knud]] that if we write V log → S log for the stable log curve obtained by
forgetting the cusps of X log [so Vη = Xη ], then it follows immediately from the fact
that X is sturdy that V = X. Thus, by Lemma 2.6, (i) [cf. also the way in which
Lemma 2.6, (i), is applied in the proof of Lemma 2.6, (ii)], it follows that, after

64

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

possibly replacing k by a ﬁnite extension of k, there exists a morphism of stable log
curves over S log
φlog : Y log → X log
such that if we write φ for the morphism of schemes underlying φlog , then φη :
Yη → Xη is a ﬁnite étale Galois covering of degree p that is wildly ramiﬁed over the
irreducible component C of X containing ξ.
Next, let us suppose that the property (c) is satisﬁed. Thus, there exists an
irreducible component E of Y that maps to ξ. Next, let us observe that there exists
an irreducible component D of Y that maps ﬁnitely to C and meets the connected
component F of the ﬁber φ−1 (ξ) that contains E [so D is not contained in F ]. In
particular, it follows that there exists a chain of irreducible components
E1 = E, E2 , . . . , En
[where n ≥ 1 is an integer] of Y joining E to D such that each Ej ⊆ F [for
j = 1, . . . , n]. Thus, En meets D at some node of Y that maps to ξ. That is to say,
property (b) is satisﬁed. Thus, to complete the proof of Corollary 2.11, it suﬃces
to verify property (c).
Now suppose that property (c) fails to hold. Then φ is ﬁnite over some neighborhood of ξ. Since φη is wildly ramiﬁed over C, it follows that there exists a
nontrivial element σ ∈ Gal(Yηlog /Xηlog ) that ﬁxes and acts as the identity on some
irreducible component D of Y that maps ﬁnitely to C. After possibly replacing k
by a ﬁnite extension of k, it follows from the ﬁniteness of φ over some neighborhood
of ξ that we may assume that there exists a cusp ζ ∈ Y (S) of Y log lying over ξ
such that the restriction ζ of ζ to Y lies in D. But then the distinct [since σ is
nontrivial, and φη is étale] cusps ζ, ζ σ of Y log have identical restrictions ζ, ζ σ to Y
— in contradiction to the deﬁnition of a “stable log curve” [i.e., of a “pointed stable
curve”]. This completes the proof of property (c) and hence of Corollary 2.11.
Remark 2.11.1.
(i) The statement of [Mzk9], Corollary 3.11, concerns smooth log curves over an
MLF, but in fact, the same proof as the proof given in [Mzk9] for [Mzk9], Corollary
3.11, may be applied to smooth log curves over an arbitrary mixed characteristic
complete discretely valued ﬁeld. Here, we note that by passing to an appropriate
extension, this discretely valued ﬁeld may be assumed to have a perfect residue ﬁeld,
as in Corollary 2.11. In particular, Corollary 2.11 may be applied to [the portion
corresponding to “observation (iv)” in loc. cit. of] the proof of such a generalization
of [Mzk9], Corollary 3.11, for more general ﬁelds.
(ii) In the discussion of the “pro-Σ version” of [Mzk9], Corollary 3.11, in
[Mzk9], Remark 3.11.1,
one should assume that pα , pβ ∈ Σ.
In fact, this assumption is, in some sense, implicit in the phraseology that appears
in the ﬁrst two lines of [Mzk9], Remark 3.11.1, but it should have been stated
explicitly.

Section 3: Elliptic and Belyi Cuspidalizations
The sort of preservation of decomposition groups of closed points that is required in the hypothesis of Corollary 2.9 is shown [for certain types of hyperbolic
curves] in the case of proﬁnite geometric fundamental groups in [Mzk8], Corollary
3.2. On the other hand, at the time of writing, the author does not know of any
such results in the case of pro-Σ geometric fundamental groups, when Σ is not equal
to the set of all primes. Nevertheless, in the present §3, we observe that the techniques of [Mzk8], §2, concerning the preservation of decomposition groups of torsion
points of elliptic curves do indeed hold for fairly general pro-Σ geometric fundamental groups [cf. Corollaries 3.3, 3.4]. Moreover, we observe that these techniques —
which may be applied not only to [hyperbolic orbicurves related to] elliptic curves,
but also, in the proﬁnite case, to [hyperbolic orbicurves related to] tripods [i.e.,
hyperbolic curves of type (0, 3) — cf. [Mzk15], §0], via the use of Belyi maps —
allow one to recover not only the decomposition groups of [certain] closed points,
but also the resulting “cuspidalizations” [i.e., the arithmetic fundamental groups of
open subschemes obtained by removing such closed points] — cf. Corollaries 3.7,
3.8.
Let X be a hyperbolic orbicurve over a ﬁeld k of characteristic zero; k an
algebraic closure of k. We shall denote the base-change operation “×k k” by means
of a subscript k. Thus, we have an exact sequence of fundamental groups 1 →
π1 (Xk ) → π1 (X) → Gal(k/k) → 1.
Deﬁnition 3.1. Let π1 (X)  Π be a quotient of proﬁnite groups. Write Δ ⊆ Π
for the image of π1 (Xk ) in Π. Then we shall say that X is Π-elliptically admissible
if the following conditions hold:
(a) X admits a k-core [in the sense of [Mzk6], Remark 2.1.1] X → C;
(b) C is semi-elliptic [cf. §0], hence admits a double covering D → C by a
once-punctured elliptic curve D;
(c) X admits a ﬁnite étale covering Y → X by a hyperbolic curve Y over a
ﬁnite extension kY of k that arises from a normal open subgroup ΠY ⊆ Π
such that the resulting ﬁnite étale covering Y → C factors as the composite
of a covering Y → D with the covering D → C and, moreover, is such
that, for every set of primes Σ such that some open subgroup of Δ is
pro-Σ, it holds that Δ is pro-Σ, and, moreover, the degree of the covering
Y → C ×k kY is a product of primes [perhaps with multiplicities] ∈ Σ.
When Π = π1 (X), we shall simply say that X is elliptically admissible.
Remark 3.1.1. In the notation of Deﬁnition 3.1, one veriﬁes immediately that
Dk → Ck may be characterized as the unique [up to isomorphism over Ck ] ﬁnite
étale double covering of Ck by a hyperbolic curve [i.e., as opposed to an arbitrary
hyperbolic orbicurve].

Example 3.2.

Scheme-theoretic Elliptic Cuspidalizations.

(i) Let N be a positive integer; D a once-punctured elliptic curve over a ﬁnite
Galois extension k  of k such that all of the N -torsion points of the underlying
elliptic curve E of D are deﬁned over k  ; D → C a semi-elliptic k  -core of D [such
that D → C is the double covering appearing in the deﬁnition of “semi-elliptic”].
Then the morphism [N ]E : E → E given by multiplication by N determines a ﬁnite
étale covering [N ]D : U → D [of degree N 2 ], together with an open embedding
U → D [which we use to identify U with its image in D], i.e., we have a diagram
as follows:
U → D

Suppose that the Galois group Gal(k/k) is slim. Then, in the language of [Mzk15],
§4, this situation may be described as follows [cf. [Mzk15], Deﬁnition 4.2, (i),
where we take the extension “1 → Δ → Π → G → 1” to be the extension 1 →
π1 (D ×k k) → π1 (D) → Gal(k/k  ) → 1]: The above diagram yields a chain

U1 → D
[which, in our notation, amounts to the identity morphism] from the U1 at the end
of the above chain to the unique D of the trivial chain [of length 0]. In particular:
The above chain may thought of as a construction of a “cuspidalization”
[i.e., result of passing to an open subscheme by removing various closed
points] U → D of D.
The remainder of the portion of the theory of the present §3 concerning elliptic
cuspidalizations consists, in essence, of the unraveling of various consequences of
this “chain-theoretic formulation” of the diagram that appears at the beginning of
the present item (i).
(ii) A variant of the discussion of (i) may be obtained as follows. In the notation
of (i), suppose further that X is an elliptically admissible hyperbolic orbicurve over
k, and that we have been given ﬁnite étale coverings V → X, V → D, where V is a
hyperbolic curve over k  . Also, [for simplicity] we suppose that V → X is a Galois
def

covering such that Gal(V /X) preserves the open subscheme UV = V ×D U ⊆ V
[i.e., the inverse image of U ⊆ D via V → D]. Thus, UV ⊆ V descends to an
open subscheme UX ⊆ X. Then by appending to the chain of (i) the “ﬁnite étale

the “ﬁnite étale covering” V → D, followed by the “ﬁnite étale quotient” V → X
on the right, we obtain a chain

[where the “. . . ” are all “•’s”], together with a terminal isomorphism X∗ → X
[i.e., the identity morphism]. In particular, the above chain may thought of as a
construction of a “cuspidalization” UX → X of X via the construction of a “cuspidalization” UV → V of V , equipped with descent data [i.e., a suitable collection of
automorphisms] with respect to the ﬁnite étale Galois covering V → X.
Now by translating the scheme-theoretic discussion of Example 3.2 into the
language of proﬁnite groups via the theory of [Mzk15], §4, we obtain the following
result.
Corollary 3.3. (Pro-Σ Elliptic Cuspidalization I: Algorithms) Let D be a
chain-full set of collections of partial construction data [cf. [Mzk15], Deﬁnition
4.6, (i)] such that the rel-isom-DGC holds [i.e., the “relative isomorphism version

k the resulting ﬁeld extension of k [so G → Gal(

×
some l ∈ Σ, the cyclotomic character G → Zl has open image. Thus, by the
theory of [Mzk15], §4, we have associated categories
Chain(Π);

Chainiso-trm (Π);

ÉtLoc(Π)

which may be constructed via purely “group-theoretic” operations from the
extension of proﬁnite groups 1 → Δ → Π → G → 1 [cf. [Mzk15], Deﬁnition 4.2,
(iii), (iv), (v); [Mzk15], Lemma 4.5, (v); the proof of [Mzk15], Theorem 4.7, (ii)].
Then:

(iii) Write ΔD = Ker(ΠD  G ). Let N be a positive integer which is a
product of primes [perhaps with multipliticites] of Σ; U ⊆ D the open subscheme

inverse image of U ⊆ D via V → D], while V → D arises from an open immersion
ΠV → ΠD . Thus, UV ⊆ V descends to an open subscheme UX ⊆ X, and U ⊆ D,
UV ⊆ V , UX ⊆ X determine extensions of GSAFG-type
1 → ΔU → ΠU → G → 1;

1 → ΔUV → ΠUV → G → 1

1 → ΔUX → ΠUX → G → 1
[i.e., by considering the ﬁnite étale Galois coverings of degree a product of primes
[perhaps with multipliticites] ∈ Σ over coverings of U , UV , UX arising from Π],
together with natural surjections ΠU  ΠD , ΠUV  ΠV , ΠUX  Π and open immersions ΠUV → ΠU , ΠUV → ΠUX . [In particular, ΔU , ΔUV , and ΔUX are pro-Σ
groups.] Then, for any G ⊆ G that is suﬃciently small, where “suﬃciently”
depends only on N , the natural surjection
ΠUX  Π
— i.e., “cuspidalization” of Π — may be constructed via “group-theoretic”
operations as follows:
(a) There exists a [not necessarily unique] Π-chain, which admits an entirely “group-theoretic” description, with associated type-chain

group of the above-mentioned Π-chain; the natural surjection ΠUV 
ΠV may then be recovered from ΠU  ΠD by forming the ﬁber product

respect to the unique lifting [relative to ΠUV  ΠV ] of the outer action of
the ﬁnite group Π/ΠV on ΠV to a group of outer automorphisms of ΠUV .
(c) The decomposition groups of the closed points of X lying in the
complement of UX may be obtained as the images via ΠUX  Π of the
cuspidal decomposition groups of ΠUX [cf. [Mzk15], Lemma 4.5, (v)].

Proof. The assertions of Corollary 3.3 follow immediately from the deﬁnitions,
together with the various references quoted in the course of the “group-theoretic”
reconstruction algorithm described in the statement of Corollary 3.3, and the equivalences of [Mzk15], Theorem 4.7, (i).
Remark 3.3.1. Let p be a prime number. Then if one takes F to be set of isomorphism classes of generalized sub-p-adic ﬁelds, S the set of sets of prime numbers
containing p, and V to be the set of isomorphism classes of hyperbolic orbicurves
def
over ﬁelds whose isomorphism class ∈ F, then D = V×F×S satisﬁes the hypothesis
of Corollary 3.3 concerning “D” [cf. [Mzk15], Example 4.8, (i)].
Remark 3.3.2. Recall that when k is an MLF or an NF, the subgroup Δ ⊆ Π
admits a purely “group-theoretic” characterization [cf. [Mzk15], Theorem 2.6, (v),
(vi)]. Thus, when k is an MLF or an NF, the various “group-theoretic” reconstruction algorithms described in the statement of Corollary 3.3 may be thought of as
being applied not to the extension 1 → Δ → Π → G → 1, but rather to the single
proﬁnite group Π.
Remark 3.3.3. One veriﬁes immediately that Corollary 3.3 admits a “tempered
version”, when the base ﬁeld k is an MLF [cf. [Mzk15], Theorem 4.12, (i)]. We
leave the routine details to the reader.
Remark 3.3.4. By applying the tempered version of Corollary 3.3 discussed in
Remark 3.3.3, one may obtain “explicit reconstruction algorithm versions” of certain
results of [Mzk12] [cf. [Mzk12], Theorem 1.6; [Mzk12], Remark 1.6.1] concerning
the étale theta function. We leave the routine details to the reader.
The “group-theoretic” algorithm of Corollary 3.3 has the following immediate
“Grothendieck Conjecture-style” consequence.
Corollary 3.4.

φU : ΠUX1 → ΠUX2
that is compatible with φ, relative to the natural surjections ΠUXi  Πi . Moreover, such an isomorphism is unique up to composition with an inner automorphism arising from an element of the kernel of ΠUXi  Πi .
Proof. The construction of φU follows immediately from Corollary 3.3; the asserted
uniqueness then follows immediately from our assumption that the rel-isom-DGC
holds.
Remark 3.4.1. Just as in the case of Corollary 3.3 [cf. Remark 3.3.3], Corollary
3.4 admits a “tempered version”, when the base ﬁelds ki invoved are MLF’s. We
leave the routine details to the reader.

may obtain “pro-Σ tempered” versions of certain results of [Mzk12] [cf. [Mzk12],
Theorem 1.6; [Mzk12], Remark 1.6.1] concerning the étale theta function. We leave

Now we return to the notation introduced at the beginning of the present
§3: Let X be a hyperbolic orbicurve over a ﬁeld k of characteristic zero; k an
algebraic closure of k. Thus, we have an exact sequence of fundamental groups
1 → π1 (X ×k k) → π1 (X) → Gal(k/k) → 1.
Deﬁnition 3.5. We shall say that X is of strictly Belyi type if it is deﬁned over
a number ﬁeld and isogenous [cf. §0] to a hyperbolic curve of genus zero. [Thus,
this deﬁnition generalizes the deﬁnition of [Mzk14], Deﬁnition 2.3, (i).]
Example 3.6.

Scheme-theoretic Belyi Cuspidalizations.

(i) Let P be a copy of the projective line minus three points over a ﬁnite Galois
extension k  of k; V an arbitrary hyperbolic curve over k  ; U ⊆ V a nonempty open
subscheme [hence, in particular, a hyperbolic curve over k  ]. Suppose that U [hence
also V ] is deﬁned over a number ﬁeld. Then it follows from the existence of Belyi
maps [cf. [Belyi]; [Mzk7]] that, for some nonempty open subscheme W ⊆ U , there
exists a diagram as follows:
W →
⏐
⏐β

U

→ V

P
[where the “→’s” are the natural open immersions; the “Belyi map” β is ﬁnite
étale]. By replacing k  by some ﬁnite extension of k  , let us suppose further [for
simplicity] that the cusps of W are all deﬁned over k  . Also, let us suppose that the
Galois group Gal(k/k) is slim. Then, in the language of [Mzk15], §4, this situation
may be described as follows [cf. [Mzk15], Deﬁnition 4.2, (i), where we take the
extension “1 → Δ → Π → G → 1” to be the extension 1 → π1 (P ×k k) →
π1 (P ) → Gal(k/k  ) → 1]: For some nonnegative integers n, m, the above diagram
yields a chain
P  W (→ P )  (W →) Wn  (Wn →) Wn−1  . . .
def

 (W2 →) W1 = U  (U →) Um  (Um →) Um−1  . . .
def

 (U2 →) U1 = V
whose associated type-chain is
, •, . . . , •
[i.e., a ﬁnite étale covering, followed by n + m de-cuspidalizations]. In particular:
The above chain may thought of as a construction of a “cuspidalization”
[i.e., result of passing to an open subscheme by removing various closed
points] U → V of V .
The remainder of the portion of the theory of the present §3 concerning Belyi
cuspidalizations consists, in essence, of the unraveling of various consequences of

72

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

this “chain-theoretic formulation” of the diagram that appears at the beginning of
the present item (i).
(ii) A variant of the discussion of (i) may be obtained as follows. In the notation
of (i), suppose further that X is a hyperbolic orbicurve of strictly Belyi type over k,
and that we have been given ﬁnite étale coverings V → X, V → Q, together with
an open immersion Q → P [so Q is a hyperbolic curve of genus zero over k  ]. Also,
[for simplicity] we suppose that V → X is Galois, that U ⊆ V descends to an open
subscheme UX ⊆ X, and [by possibly replacing k  by a ﬁnite extension of k  ] that
the cusps of Q are deﬁned over k  . Then by appending to the chain of (i) the “ﬁnite
étale covering” V → X, followed by the “ﬁnite étale quotient” V → Q, followed by
def
the de-cuspidalizations Q → Ql → . . . → Q1 = P [for some nonnegative integer l],
on the left, and the “ﬁnite étale quotient” V → X on the right, we obtain a chain
def

X  V (→ X)  (V →) Q  (Q →) Ql  . . .  (Q2 →) Q1 = P
def

 W (→ P )  (W →) Wn  . . .  (W2 →) W1 = U  (U →) Um  . . .
def

def

 (U2 →) U1 = V  (V →) X∗ = X
whose associated type-chain is
, , •, . . . , •, , •, . . . , •, 
∼

[where the “. . . ” are all “•’s”], together with a terminal isomorphism X∗ → X
[i.e., the identity morphism]. In particular, the above chain may thought of as
a construction of a “cuspidalization” UX → X of X via the construction of a
“cuspidalization” U → V of V , equipped with descent data [i.e., a suitable collection
of automorphisms] with respect to the ﬁnite étale Galois covering V → X.
Now by translating the scheme-theoretic discussion of Example 3.6 into the
language of proﬁnite groups via the theory of [Mzk15], §4, we obtain the following
result.
Corollary 3.7. (Proﬁnite Belyi Cuspidalization I: Algorithms) Let D be a
chain-full set of collections of partial construction data [cf. [Mzk15], Deﬁnition
4.6, (i)] such that the rel-isom-DGC holds [i.e., the “relative isomorphism version
of the Grothendieck Conjecture for D holds” — cf. [Mzk15], Deﬁnition 4.6, (ii)];
G a slim proﬁnite group;
1→Δ→Π→G→1
an extension of GSAFG-type that admits partial construction data (k, X, Σ),
where k is of characteristic zero, X is a hyperbolic orbicurve of strictly
Belyi type [cf. Deﬁnition 3.5], and Σ is the set of all primes, such that
∼
([X], [k], Σ) ∈ D; α : π1 (X) → Π the corresponding scheme-theoretic envelope
[cf. [Mzk15], Deﬁnition 2.1, (iii)], which is an isomorphism of proﬁnite groups;
∼

 → X the pro-ﬁnite étale covering of X determined by α [so Π →
Gal(X/X)];
X
∼

k the resulting algebraic closure of k [so G → Gal(
k/k)]. Suppose further that, for
×
some l ∈ Σ, the cyclotomic character G → Zl has open image. Thus, by the
theory of [Mzk15], §4, we have associated categories

which may be constructed via purely “group-theoretic” operations from the
extension of proﬁnite groups 1 → Δ → Π → G → 1 [cf. [Mzk15], Deﬁnition 4.2,
(iii), (iv), (v); [Mzk15], Lemma 4.5, (v); the proof of [Mzk15], Theorem 4.7, (ii)].
Then for every nonempty open subscheme

Π — may be constructed via “group-theoretic” operations as follows:
(a) For some normal open subgroup ΠV ⊆ Π, which corresponds to a ﬁnite covering V → X of hyperbolic orbicurves, there exists a [not necessarily unique] Π-chain, which admits an entirely “group-theoretic”
description, with associated type-chain
, , •, . . . , •, , •, . . . , •, 
— cf. Example 3.6, (ii) — that admits a terminal isomorphism with
def

the trivial Π-chain [of length 0] such that if we write U = V ×X UX ,
def

ΠU = ΠV ×Π ΠUX , then the natural surjection ΠU  ΠV may be
recovered from the chain of “•’s” terminating at the second to last group
of the above-mentioned Π-chain.
(b) The natural surjection ΠUX  Π may be recovered from ΠU  ΠV
out

by forming the “  ” [cf. §0] with respect to the unique lifting [relative
to ΠU  ΠV ] of the outer action of the ﬁnite group Π/ΠV on ΠV to a
group of outer automorphisms of ΠU .
(c) The decomposition groups of the closed points of X lying in the
complement of UX may be obtained as the images via ΠUX  Π of the
cuspidal decomposition groups of ΠUX [cf. [Mzk15], Lemma 4.5, (v)].

Proof. The assertions of Corollary 3.7 follow immediately from the deﬁnitions,
together with the various references quoted in the course of the “group-theoretic”
reconstruction algorithm described in the statement of Corollary 3.7, and the equivalences of [Mzk15], Theorem 4.7, (i).
Remark 3.7.1. Similar remarks to Remarks 3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3 may be made for
Corollary 3.7.
Remark 3.7.2. In the situation of Corollary 3.7, when the ﬁeld k is an MLF, one
then obtains an algorithm for constructing the decomposition groups of arbitrary
closed points of X, by combining the algorithms of Corollary 3.7 — cf., especially,

Corollary 3.7, (c), which allows one to construct the decomposition groups of those
closed points of X which [like UX !] are deﬁned over a number ﬁeld — with the “padic approximation lemma” of [Mzk8] [i.e., [Mzk8], Lemma 3.1]. A “Grothendieck
Conjecture-style” version of this sort of reconstruction of decomposition groups of
arbitrary closed points of X may be found in [Mzk8], Corollary 3.2.
The “group-theoretic” algorithm of Corollary 3.7 has the following immediate
“Grothendieck Conjecture-style” consequence.
Corollary 3.8.
(Proﬁnite Belyi Cuspidalization II: Comparison) Let
D be a chain-full set of collections of partial construction data [cf. [Mzk15],
Deﬁnition 4.6, (i)] such that the rel-isom-DGC holds [cf. [Mzk15], Deﬁnition 4.6,
(ii)]. For i = 1, 2, let Gi be a slim proﬁnite group;
1 → Δi → Πi → Gi → 1
an extension of GSAFG-type that admits partial construction data (ki , Xi , Σi ),
where ki is of characteristic zero, Xi is a hyperbolic orbicurve of strictly
Belyi type [cf. Deﬁnition 3.5], and Σi is the set of all primes, such that
∼
([Xi ], [ki ], Σi ) ∈ D; αi : π1 (Xi ) → Πi the corresponding scheme-theoretic envelope [cf. [Mzk15], Deﬁnition 2.1, (iii)], which is an isomorphism of proﬁnite

If, for i = 1, 2, UXi ⊆ Xi is a nonempty open subscheme which is deﬁned

for the extension of GSAFG-type determined by [αi and] the natural surjection
π1 (UXi )  Gal(

Gi → Z×
l have open image for i = 1, 2. Let
∼

φ : Π1 → Π2
be an isomorphism of proﬁnite groups such that φ(Δ1 ) = Δ2 . Then, for each
nonempty open subscheme UX1 ⊆ X1 deﬁned over a number ﬁeld, there exist a
nonempty open subscheme UX2 ⊆ X2 deﬁned over a number ﬁeld and an isomorphism of proﬁnite groups
∼

φU : ΠUX1 → ΠUX2
that is compatible with φ, relative to the natural surjections ΠUXi  Πi . Moreover, such an isomorphism φU is unique up to composition with an inner automorphism arising from an element of the kernel of ΠUXi  Πi .
