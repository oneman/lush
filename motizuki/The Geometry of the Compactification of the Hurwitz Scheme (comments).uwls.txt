COMMENTS
ON
“THE
GEOMETRY
OF
THE
COMPACTIFICATION
OF
THE
HURWITZ
SCHEME”

(1.)
In
the
statement
of
the
Theorem
of
§3.22,
the
deﬁnition
of
the
morphisms
of
the
stack
under
consideration
is
only
given
explicitly
in
the
case
where
the
domain
and
codomain
of
the
morphism
are
identical;
in
fact,
however,
the
deﬁnition
should
[and,
indeed,
can
easily]
be
given
for
morphisms
for
which
the
domain
and
codomain
of
the
morphism
are
not
necessarily
identical.
(2.)
In
§4.6,
(2),
(B),
β),
the
phrase
“ramiﬁcation)going”
should
read
“ramiﬁcation)
going”.
(3.)
In
the
illustration
given
in
the
Pictorial
Appendix
for
Species
3B∗
,
the
lowermost
irreducible
component
on
the
right-hand
side
of
the
domain
curve
of
the
covering
[i.e.,
the
irreducible
component
marked
by
the
phrase
“one
copy
of
P1
”]
should
be
deleted.
