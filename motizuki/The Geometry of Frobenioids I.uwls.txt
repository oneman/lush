We
develop
the
theory
of
Frobenioids,
which
may
be
regarded
as
a
category-theoretic
abstraction
of
the
theory
of
divisors
and
line
bundles
on
models
of
ﬁnite
separable
extensions
of
a
given
function
ﬁeld
or
number
ﬁeld.
This
sort
of
abstraction
is
analogous
to
the
role
of
Galois
categories
in
Galois
theory
or
monoids
in
the
geometry
of
log
schemes.
This
abstract
category-theoretic
framework
preserves
many
of
the
important
features
of
the
classical
theory
of
divisors
and
line
bundles
on
models
of
ﬁnite
separable
extensions
of
a
function
ﬁeld
or
number
ﬁeld
such
as
the
global
degree
of
an
arithmetic
line
bundle
over
a
number
ﬁeld,
but
also
exhibits
interesting
new
phenomena,
such
as
a
“Frobenius
endomorphism”
of
the
Frobenioid
associated
to
a
number
ﬁeld.

§I1.
Technical
Summary
In
the
present
paper,
we
introduce
the
notion
of
a
Frobenioid.
The
simplest
kind
of
Frobenioid
“FM
”
is
the
non-commutative
monoid
given
by
forming
the
“semi-direct
product
monoid”
of
a
given
commutative
monoid
M
with
the
multiplicative
monoid
of
positive
integers
N≥1
[cf.
§0],
where
n
∈
N≥1
acts
on
M
by
multiplication
by
n;
that
is
to
say,
the
underlying
set
of
FM
is
the
product
M
×
N≥1
equipped
with
the
monoid
structure
is
given
as
follows:
if
a1
,
a2
∈
M
,
n1
,
n2
∈
N≥1
,
then
(a1
,
n1
)
·
(a2
,
n2
)
=
(a1
+
n1
·
a2
,
n1
·
n2
)
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(iii)].
For
instance,
when
M
is
taken
to
be
the
additive
monoid
of
nonnegative
integers
Z≥0
[cf.
§0],
def
we
shall
write
F
=
FZ≥0
and
refer
to
F
as
the
standard
Frobenioid.
Note
that
in
general,
any
monoid
[such
as
FM
,
for
instance]
may
be
thought
of
as
a
category,
i.e.,
the
category
with
precisely
one
object
whose
monoid
of
endomorphisms
is
the
given
monoid.
More
generally,
one
may
start
with
a
“family
of
commutative
monoids”
Φ
on
a
“base
category”
D
[where
Φ,
D
satisfy
certain
properties]
and
form
the
associated
elementary
Frobenioid
FΦ
by
taking
the
“semi-direct
product”
of
N≥1
with
Φ
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(iii),
for
more
details].
Here,
FΦ
is
a
category.
In
general,
a
Frobenioid
C
is
a
category
equipped
with
a
functor
C
→
FΦ
to
an
elementary
Frobenioid
FΦ
satisfying
certain
properties
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3
for
more
details]
to
the
eﬀect
that
the
structure
of
C
is
“substantially
reﬂected”
in
this
functor
C
→
FΦ
.
From
the
point
of
view
of
conventional
arithmetic
geometry,
a
Frobenioid
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
a
category-theoretic
abstraction
of
the
theory
of
divisors
and
line
bundles
on
models
of
ﬁnite
separable
extensions
of
a
given
function
ﬁeld
or
number
ﬁeld.
That
is
to
say,
the
base
category
D
corresponds
to
the
category
of
models
of
ﬁnite
separable
extensions
of
a
given
function
ﬁeld
or
number
ﬁeld;
the
functor
Φ
corresponds
to
the
divisors
on
such
models;
the
“N≥1
portion”
of
FΦ
corresponds
to
the
operation
of
multiplying
a
divisor
by
an
element
n
∈
N≥1
[or,
if
one
considers
the
line
bundle
associated
to
such
a
divisor,
to
the
operation
of
forming
the
n-th
tensor
power
of
the
line
bundle].
In
some
sense,
the
main
result
of
the
theory
of
present
paper
is
the
following:
Under
various
technical
conditions,
the
functor
C
→
FΦ
that
determines
the
structure
of
C
as
a
Frobenioid
may
be
reconstructed
purely
categorytheoretically,
i.e.,
from
the
structure
of
C
as
a
category
[cf.
Corollary
4.11].
These
technical
conditions
are
typically
satisﬁed
by
Frobenioids
that
arise
naturally
from
arithmetic
geometry
[cf.
Theorems
6.2,
6.4].
Also,
we
observe
that
these
technical
conditions
appear
unlikely
to
be
superﬂuous.
Indeed,
we
also
give
various
examples,
involving
Frobenioids
which
do
not
satisfy
various
of
these
technical
conditions,
of
equivalences
of
categories
with
respect
to
which
various
portions
of
THE
GEOMETRY
OF
FROBENIOIDS
I
3
the
functor
C
→
FΦ
are
not
preserved
[cf.
Examples
3.5,
3.6,
3.7,
3.8,
3.9,
3.10,
4.3].
Perhaps
the
most
fundamental
example
of
this
phenomenon
of
“the
intrinsic
category-theoretic
reconstruction
of
C
→
FΦ
from
C”
is
the
following.
The
prototype
of
a
base
category
D
is
given
by
[the
subcategory
of
connected
objects
of]
a
Galois
category,
i.e.,
a
category
in
which
the
monoids
of
endomorphisms
of
objects
have
the
structure
of
ﬁnite
groups.
On
the
other
hand,
the
prototype
of
the
“nonbase
category
portion”
of
a
Frobenioid,
i.e.,
the
“relative
structure
of
C
over
D”,
is
given
by
the
monoid
“F”
[or,
more
generally,
the
monoids
“FM
”]
discussed
above.
Then
one
central
aspect
of
the
phenomenon
that
“the
relative
structure
of
C
over
D
is
never
confused
with
the
structure
of
D”
is
illustrated
by
the
following
easily
veriﬁed
observation:
If
G
is
a
ﬁnite
group,
then
any
homomorphism
of
monoids
F
→
G
factors
through
the
natural
surjection
F

N≥1
.
[We
refer
to
Remark
3.1.2
for
more
details.]
Note
that
this
property
fails
to
hold
if,
for
instance,
one
replaces
F
=
FZ≥0
by
Z≥0
[and
the
surjection
F

N≥1
by
the
surjection
Z≥0

{0}].
Put
another
way,
this
property
may
be
thought
of
as
a
consequence
of
the
non-abelian
nature
of
F.
In
particular,
if
one
thinks
of
the
category-theoretic
reconstructibility
of
the
functor
“C
→
FΦ
”
as
a
sort
of
rigidity,
then
this
property
is
vaguely
reminiscent
of
the
“extraordinary
rigidity”
asserted
by
Grothendieck
in
descriptions
of
his
anabelian
philosophy.
After
deﬁning
and
examining
the
ﬁrst
properties
of
Frobenioids
in
§1,
we
proceed
to
discuss,
in
§2,
various
versions
of
“Frobenius
functors”
on
Frobenioids,
which
are
intended
as
category-theoretic
abstractions
of
the
Frobenius
morphism
in
positive
characteristic
algebraic
geometry
[cf.
Remark
6.2.1].
In
§3,
we
begin
the
category-theoretic
reconstruction
of
the
functor
“C
→
FΦ
”
by
showing
that,
under
certain
conditions,
the
base
category
and
“Frobenius
degree”
[i.e.,
in
eﬀect,
the
“N≥1
portion
of
FΦ
”]
may
be
reconstructed
category-theoretically
[cf.
Theorem
3.4].
In
the
theory
of
§3,
we
apply
a
certain
purely
category-theoretic
technique,
which
we
shall
refer
to
as
“slim
exponentiation”;
this
technique
is
entirely
independent
of
the
theory
of
Frobenioids
and
is
discussed
in
detail
in
the
Appendix.
In
§4,
we
then
complete
the
category-theoretic
reconstruction
of
the
functor
“C
→
FΦ
”
by
showing
that,
under
certain
conditions,
the
divisor
monoid
Φ
may
also
be
reconstructed
category-theoretically
[cf.
Theorem
4.9].
In
§5,
we
study
the
extent
to
which,
under
certain
conditions,
one
may
write
down
“explicit
models”
of
fairly
general
Frobenioids,
in
a
fashion
reminiscent
of
the
explicit
description
of
the
elementary
Frobenioid
FΦ
[cf.
Theorem
5.2].
This
study
leads
naturally
to
the
investigation
of
various
auxiliary
structures
on
a
Frobenioid,
namely,
base
sections
and
baseFrobenius
pairs,
that
may
be
used
to
relate
a
given
Frobenioid
satisfying
certain
conditions
to
such
a
“model
Frobenioid”
[cf.
Theorem
5.2,
(iv)].
One
important
technique
in
the
theory
of
§3,
§4,
§5
is
the
operation
of
passing
from
a
Frobenioid
to
the
perfection
or
realiﬁcation
of
the
Frobenioid.
Roughly
speaking,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
monoid
F
=
FZ≥0
introduced
above,
these
4
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
operations
correspond,
respectively,
to
passing
from
“Z≥0
”
to
the
monoids
“Q≥0
”
[in
the
case
of
the
perfection]
or
“R≥0
”
[in
the
case
of
the
realiﬁcation].
Another
important
technique
in
this
theory
is
the
operation
of
passing
to
the
birationalization
of
a
Frobenioid.
This
may
be
thought
of
as
a
category-theoretic
abstraction
of
the
notion
of
“working
with
rational
functions”
in
algebraic
geometry;
alternatively,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
monoid
F
=
FZ≥0
introduced
above,
it
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
the
operation
of
passing
from
“Z≥0
”
to
the
groupiﬁcation
“Z”
of
Z≥0

Finally,
in
§6,
we
consider
the
main
motivating
examples
of
Frobenioids
that
arise
from
number
ﬁelds
and
function
ﬁelds.
In
particular,
we
observe
in
passing
that
this
“Frobenioid-theoretic
formulation
of
the
elementary
arithmetic
of
number
ﬁelds”
also
gives
rise
to
some
interesting
“Frobenioid-theoretic
interpretations”
of
such
classical
results
in
number
theory
as
the
Dirichlet
unit
theorem
and
Tchebotarev’s
density
theorem,
as
well
as
a
result
in
transcendence
theory
due
to
Lang
[cf.
Theorem
6.4,
(i),
(iii),
(iv)].
§I2.
Abstract
Combinatorialization
of
Arithmetic
Geometry
From
a
somewhat
more
conceptual
point
of
view,
one
central
theme
of
the
present
paper
is
the
goal
of
“abstract
combinatorialization
of
scheme-theoretic
arithmetic
geometry”.
Classical
examples
of
this
phenomenon
of
“abstract
combinatorialization”
may
be
seen
in
the
theory
of
Galois
categories
or
the
theory
of
monoids
in
the
geometry
of
log
schemes
[or,
more
classically,
toric
varieties].
That
is
to
say,
even
if
one
starts
by
considering
various
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
schemes,
the
associated
Galois
category
is
a
purely
“abstract
combinatorial”
mathematical
object
that
captures
the
“Galois
structure”
of
the
various
coverings
involved
in
a
fashion
that
is
entirely
independent
of
scheme
theory.
In
a
similar
vein,
although
a
monoid
of
the
sort
that
appears
in
log
geometry
arises
as
a
submonoid
of
the
multiplicative
monoid
determined
by
some
commutative
ring,
the
“abstract
combinatorial”
structure
of
such
a
monoid
is
suﬃcient
to
capture
various
essential
properties
[such
as
normality,
etc.]
of
the
ring
structure
of
the
ambient
ring
in
a
fashion
that
is
entirely
independent
of
ring/scheme
theory.
A
somewhat
less
classical
example
of
this
phenomenon
of
“abstract
combinatorialization
of
scheme
theory”
is
given
by
the
theory
of
[Mzk8],
where
it
is
shown
that
very
general
locally
noetherian
log
schemes
may
be
“represented”
by
categories,
in
the
sense
that
equivalences
between
such
categories
arise
from
uniquely
determined
isomorphisms
of
log
schemes.
The
theory
of
[Mzk8]
is
generalized
in
[Mzk9]
so
as
to
take
into
account
the
archimedean
primes
of
log
schemes
which
are
locally
of
ﬁnite
THE
GEOMETRY

I

type
over
a
Zariski
localization
of
[the
ring
of
rational
integers]
Z.
As
is
discussed
in
the
introduction
to
[Mzk8],
this
kind
of
result
is
motivated
partly
by
the
anabelian
philosophy
of
Grothendieck,
but
perhaps
more
essentially
by
the
idea
that
instead
of
working
with
set-theoretic
objects,
such
as
schemes
or
log
schemes,
one
should
regard
categories
—
which
may
be
thought
of
as
“abstract
combinatorial”
mathematical
objects
constituted
by
some
abstract
collection
of
arrows
—
as
the
“fundamental,
primitive
objects”
of
mathematics
discourse.
Thus,
Grothendieck’s
anabelian
philosophy
may
be
regarded
as
a
“special
case”
of
this
point
of
view,
i.e.,
the
case
where
the
categories
in
question
are
Galois
categories

cf.
the
“absolute

geometry”
developed
in
[Mzk5],
[Mzk6],
[Mzk7],
[Mzk10],
[Mzk11],
[Mzk12],
[Mzk14].
One
important
drawback
of
the
“anabelian
branch”
of
this
category-theoretic
approach
to
mathematics
is
that
although
it
is
very
well-suited
to
capturing
essential
aspects
of
the
geometry
of
schemes
at
nonarchimedean
primes,
it
is
ill-suited
to
capturing
the
archimedean
aspects
of
the
geometry
of
schemes,
and,
in
particular,
those
aspects
of
the
global
geometry
of
schemes
over
number
ﬁelds
—
such
as
heights
—
that
are
of
interest
in
Diophantine
geometry.
Thus,
from
this
point
of
view,
the
extension
given
in
[Mzk9]
of
the
theory
of
[Mzk8]
has
the
virtue,
relative
to
anabelian
geometry,
of
providing
a
natural
way
to
incorporate
such
archimedean
and
global
phenomena
as
the
global
degree
of
an
arithmetic
line
bundle
over
a
number
ﬁeld
[cf.
[Mzk9],
Example
5.1]
into
the
above-mentioned
category-theoretic
approach
to
mathematics.
The
approach
of
[Mzk9],
however,
has
the
following
fundamental
drawback:
The
categories
of
[Mzk9]
are
quite
“large”
and
“complicated”
by
comparison
to
Galois
categories,
in
the
sense
that
they
include
a
very
diverse
collection
of
arithmetic
schemes,
by
comparison
to
the
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
a
ﬁxed
scheme.
This
makes
it
relatively
easy
to
reconstruct
the
original
arithmetic
log
scheme
from
the
category.
On
the
other
hand,
this
relative
ease
of
reconstruction
is
a
reﬂection,
in
essence,
of
the
fact
that
the
geometry
of
such
categories
is
really
not
so
diﬀerent
from
the
conventional
geometry
of
arithmetic
log
schemes.
Thus,
in
other
words,
one
doesn’t
gain
very
much
in
the
way
of
essentially
new
geometric
phenomena
by
working
with
such
categories,
relative
to
the
conventional
geometry
of
arithmetic
log
schemes.
By
contrast,
the
relatively
simple
structure
of
Galois
categories
[cf.
also
the
categories
of
[Mzk13]]
makes
it
much
more
diﬃcult
to
reconstruct
the
scheme
from
the
category
—
indeed,
such
a
reconstruction
is
only
possible
in
the
case
of
very
6
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
special
“anabelian”
schemes
—
but,
on
the
other
hand,
this
diﬃculty
of
reconstruction
may
be
regarded
as
a
reﬂection
of
the
fact
that
there
is
indeed
some
interesting
new
geometry
that
arises
from
working
with
Galois
categories
that
does
not
exist
in
the
conventional
geometry
of
schemes.
Perhaps
the
most
fundamental
example
of
this
phenomenon
is
the
well-known
fact
that
the
absolute
Galois
groups
of
non-isomorphic
ﬁnite
ﬁelds
are
isomorphic.
Another
less
elementary
example
of
this
phenomenon
is
the
well-known
fact
that
the
Galois
category
associated
to
a
nonarchimedean
mixed-characteristic
local
ﬁeld
[i.e.,
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
the
p-adic
number
ﬁeld]
admits
self-equivalences
[i.e.,
the
associated
absolute
Galois
group
admits
automorphisms]
that
do
not
arise
from
scheme
theory
[i.e.,
from
an
isomorphism
of
ﬁelds
—
cf.,
e.g.,
[NSW],
p.
674].
Put
another
way,
the
diﬀerence
between
the
“geometry
of
categories”
—
i.e.,
the
approach
to
arithmetic
geometry
constituted
by
working
with
the
strictly
categorytheoretic
properties
of
categories
—
and
the
classical
approach
to
arithmetic
geometry
constituted
by
working
with
set-theoretic
objects
equipped
with
various
complicated
auxiliary
structures
may
be
regarded
as
analogous
to
the
diﬀerence
between
working
with
the
notion
of
an
abstract
group
and
working
with
groups
of
explicit
matrices.
That
is
to
say,
working
with
strictly
group-theoretic
properties
of
abstract
groups
allows
one
to
contemplate
various
structures
that
are
common
to
various
distinct
groups
of
explicit
matrices,
but
which
are
not
so
evident
if
one
happens
to
be
ignorant
of
the
notion
of
an
“abstract
group”
and
hence
obliged
to
restrict
oneself
to
manipulations
involving
explicit
matrices.
This
state
of
aﬀairs
prompts
the
following
question:
Can
one
perhaps
represent
certain
special
arithmetic
log
schemes
of
interest
by
categories
whose
“level
of
complexity”
is
closer
to
Galois
categories
[i.e.,
substantially
simpler
than
the
categories
of
[Mzk9]]
—
thus
allowing
one
to
hope
that
the
geometry
of
such
categories
exhibits
fundamentally
new
phenomena
that
do
not
appear
in
the
conventional
geometry
of
arithmetic
log
schemes
—
on
the
one
hand,
but
which
nevertheless
allow
one
to
work
naturally
with
archimedean
primes
and
heights
on
the
other?
This
sort
of
question
constituted
one
of
the
principal
motivations
for
the
author
to
develop
the
theory
discussed
in
the
present
paper.
The
answer
to
the
above
question
constituted
by
the
theory
of
present
paper
is,
in
a
word,
the
notion
of
a
Frobenioid.
From
the
point
of
view
of
the
question
posed
above:
Frobenioids
provide
a
single
framework
[cf.
the
notion
of
a
“Galois
category”;
the
role
of
monoids
in
log
geometry]
that
allows
one
to
capture
the
essential
aspects
of
both
the
Galois
and
the
divisor
theory
of
number
ﬁelds,
on
the
one
hand,
and
function
ﬁelds,
on
the
other,
in
such
a
way
that
one
may
continue
to
work
with,
for
instance,
global
degrees
of
arithmetic
line
bundles
on
a
number
ﬁeld,
but
which
also
exhibits
the
new
phenomenon
[not
present
in
the
classical
theory
of
number
ﬁelds]
of
a
“Frobenius
endomorphism”
of
the
Frobenioid
associated
to
a
number
ﬁeld.
THE
GEOMETRY
OF
FROBENIOIDS
I

Here,
we
remark
that
the
base
category
D
is
typically
a
category
that
is
of
a
level
of
“simplicity”
[cf.
the
above
discussion]
that
is
reminiscent
of
a
Galois
category
[cf.
also
the
“temperoids”
of
[Mzk11];
the
categories
of
Riemann
surfaces
discussed
in
[Mzk13],
§2].
Indeed,
in
the
examples
of
§6,
the
base
category
is
[the
subcategory
of
connected
objects
of]
a
Galois
category.
From
this
point
of
view,
the
main
ingredients
of
a
Frobenioid
—
that
is
to
say,
roughly
speaking,
“Galois”
[i.e.,
the
base
category
D],
“Frobenius”
[i.e.,
“N≥1
”],
and
“metrics/integral
structures”
[i.e.,
the
family
of
monoids
Φ]
—
are
reminiscent
of
the
theory
of
the
“ring
of
p-adic
periods”
Bcrys
of
p-adic
Hodge
theory.
§I3.
Frobenius
Endomorphisms
of
a
Number
Field
From
a
somewhat
less
conceptual
point
of
view,
one
of
the
main
motivations
for
the
author
in
developing
the
theory
of
Frobenioids
came
from
the
long-term
goal
of
developing
a
sort
of
arithmetic
Teichmüller
theory
for
number
ﬁelds
equipped
with
an
elliptic
curve,
in
a
fashion
that
is
analogous
to
the
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
of
[Mzk1],
[Mzk2].
That
is
to
say,
here
one
wishes
to
regard
number
ﬁelds
as
corresponding
to
hyperbolic
curves
over
ﬁnite
ﬁelds
and
elliptic
curves
[over
a
number
ﬁeld]
as
corresponding
to
the
nilpotent
ordinary
indigenous
bundles
[on
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
a
ﬁnite
ﬁeld]
of
[Mzk1],
[Mzk2].
In
the
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
of
[Mzk1],
[Mzk2],
certain
canonical
Frobenius
liftings
play
a
central
role.
Thus,
since
Frobenius
liftings
are,
literally,
liftings
of
the
Frobenius
morphism
in
positive
characteristic,
in
order
to
develop
an
“arithmetic
Teichmüller
theory”
for
number
ﬁelds
equipped
with
an
elliptic
curve,
one
must
ﬁrst
have
an
analogue
for
number
ﬁelds
of
the
Frobenius
morphism
in
positive
characteristic
scheme
theory.
If
one
starts
to
consider
such
an
analogue
from
a
completely
naive
point
of
view,
then
one
must
contend
with
the
fact
that,
if,
for
instance,
n
≥
2
is
a
integer,
then
the
morphism
p
→
pn
[where
p
is
a
prime
number]
clearly
does
not
extend
to
a
ring
homomorphism
Z
→
Z!
That
is
to
say,
it
is
diﬃcult
to
see
how
to
accommodate
such
a
“Frobenius
morphism
for
number
ﬁelds”
within
the
framework
of
scheme
theory.
On
the
other
hand,
if
one
works
with
monoids
as
in
the
theory
of
log
schemes,
then
such
a
morphism
“p
→
pn
”
does
indeed
make
sense.
Moreover,
even
if,
for
instance,
one
considers
roots
π
of
p,
the
mapping
π
→
π
n
is
Galois-equivariant.
Thus,
in
summary:
One
important
motivation
for
the
author
in
developing
the
theory
of
Frobenioids
was
the
goal
of
developing
a
geometric
framework
—
i.e.,
roughly
speaking,
a
geometry
built
up
solely
from
“Galois
theory”
and
“monoids”
—
in
which
a
“Frobenius
morphism
on
number
ﬁelds”
may
be
constructed.
8
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
Once
one
has
constructed
such
a
“Frobenius
morphism
on
number
ﬁelds”,
the
next
step
to
realizing
an
“arithmetic
Teichmüller
theory”
consists
of
constructing
a
“canonical
Frobenius
lifting”.
Although
the
construction
of
such
“canonical
Frobenius
liftings”
lies
[well!]
beyond
the
scope
of
the
present
paper,
we
remark
that
the
ideas
that
lie
behind
such
a
construction
are
motivated
by
the
[schemetheoretic!]
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
of
elliptic
curves
surveyed
in
[Mzk3],
[Mzk4],
a
theory
in
which
the
theta
function
on
a
Tate
curve
plays
a
central
role.
In
particular,
in
order
to
construct
“canonical
Frobenius
liftings”,
it
is
necessary
to
extract
the
essential
“abstract,
combinatorial
content”
of
the
scheme-theoretically
formulated
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
of
[Mzk3],
[Mzk4].
In
fact,
certain
aspects
of
such
an
“extraction
process”
are
achieved
precisely
by
applying
the
theory
of
Frobenioids,
as
is
done
in
a
certain
sequel
to
the
present
paper
and
[Mzk15]
—
namely,
[Mzk16].
Here,
we
pause
to
observe
that
to
pass
from
the
geometry
of
schemes
to,
say,
the
geometry
of
Frobenioids
amounts
to
a
certain
“partial
dismantling
of
scheme
theory”,
i.e.,
to
“forgetting”
a
certain
portion
of
scheme
theory.
As
discussed
above,
one
wants
to
execute
such
a
“partial
dismantling
of
scheme
theory”
precisely
in
order
to
allow
the
construction
of
such
objects
as
a
“Frobenius
morphism
on
number
ﬁelds”
which
are
not
possible
within
the
framework
of
scheme
theory.
On
the
other
hand,
if
the
dismantling
process
that
one
executes
is
too
drastic,
then
there
is
a
danger
of
destroying
so
much
of
the
geometry
of
scheme
theory
that
one
is
not
left
with
a
geometry
that
is
suﬃciently
rich
so
as
to
allow
the
further
development
of
the
theory.
From
this
point
of
view,
one
of
the
main
themes
of
the
present
paper
[and
[Mzk15]]
consists
of
verifying
that:
The
geometry
of
Frobenioids
retains
a
substantial
portion
of
the
geometry
of
scheme
theory
and,
in
particular,
is
suﬃciently
rich
so
as
to
permit
the
execution
of
many
geometric
constructions
and
arguments
familiar
from
scheme
theory.
The
centerpiece
of
this
veriﬁcation
process
is
the
reconstruction
of
the
functor
“C
→
FΦ
”,
as
discussed
in
§I1.
Another
aspect
of
this
veriﬁcation
process,
which
may
be
seen
throughout
the
theory
of
the
present
paper,
is
the
step-by-step
translation
of
various
scheme-theoretic
terms
and
constructions
that
appear
in
the
theory
of
divisors
and
line
bundles
on
models
of
ﬁnite
separable
extensions
of
a
given
function
ﬁeld
or
number
ﬁeld
into
purely
category-theoretic
language.
For
instance,
one
important
example
of
this
“step-by-step
translation”
is
the
theory
of
base
sections
and
base-Frobenius
pairs
developed
in
§5,
which
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
category-theoretic
translation
of
the
notion
of
the
tautological
section
of
a
trivial
line
bundle
[cf.
Remark
5.6.1].
§I4.
Étale-like
vs.
Frobenius-like
Structures
Finally,
let
us
return
to
the
“main
result”
discussed
in
§I1,
i.e.,
the
reconstruction
of
the
functor
“C
→
FΦ
”.
One
way
to
think
about
this
result
is
that
it
is
a
statement
to
the
eﬀect
that:
THE
GEOMETRY
OF
FROBENIOIDS
I
9
The
structure
of
a
[“permissible”]
base
category
D
[e.g.,
the
subcategory
of
connected
objects
of
a
Galois
category]
is
fundamentally
combinatorially
diﬀerent
—
indeed,
diﬀerent
in
a
category-theoretically
distinguishable
fashion
—
from
the
structure
of
the
“Frobenius
portion”
F
of
a
Frobenioid.
This
phenomenon
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
fundamental
dichotomy
between
types
of
combinatorial
structures
—
i.e.,
between
“étale-like”
structures
which
are
“indiﬀerent
to
order”
[cf.
the
ﬁnite
groups
that
as
appear
as
Galois
groups
in
a
Galois
category]
and
“Frobenius-like”
structures
which
are
“order-conscious”
[cf.
the
monoids
“Z≥0
”,
“N≥1
”
that
constitute
the
standard
Frobenioid
F].
One
may
also
think
of
“étale-like”
structures
as
“descent-compatible”
structures,
whereas
“Frobenius-like”
structures
are
“descent-incompatible”,
in
the
sense
that
compatibility
with
“descent”
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
violation
of
the
“order”
constituted
by
“the
object
upstairs”
in
the
descent
operation
and
the
“the
object
downstairs”.
Relative
to
the
theme
of
“abstract
combinatorialization”
discussed
in
§I2,
the
point
here
is
that
the
diﬀerence
between
“étale-like”
and
“Frobenius-like”
structures
is
an
intrinsic
structural
diﬀerence,
not
just
a
matter
of
“arbitrarily
imposed
labels
motivated
by
scheme
theory”
[such
as
“base
category”,
“divisor
monoid”,
“Frobenius
degree”,
etc.]!
For
more
on
this
fundamental
dichotomy
between
“étale-like”
and
“Frobenius-like”
categorical
structures,
we
refer
to
Remark
3.1.3.

Let
M
be
an

the

will
be

We
shall

the

Thus,
M

is
the

a

given
by
the
set
of

We

Thus,
M

M

that

Now
suppose
that

If

[i.e.,
BoundS
(b)
is
the

Observe
that
if
M
is
R-monoprime,
then
every

possesses
a

supremum
sup(S)

[i.e.,

We

irreducible
if
any
equation
a

c
in

where
b,

implies
that

We

that

is
primary
if
for

a,
where

it
holds
that
a

b.
Denote
by
Primary(M

the
set
of
primary

One
veriﬁes
immediately
that
the
relation
“a

b”
[where
a,
b
∈
Primary(M

determines
an
equivalence
relation
on
Primary(M

A
-equivalence
class
of
elements
of
Primary(M

will
be
referred
to
as
a
prime
of

[Note
that
this
notion
of
a
“prime”
diﬀers
from
the
conventional
notion
of
a
“prime

Denote
by
Prime(M

the
set
of
primes
of

If
p

Prime(M

then
we
shall
denote
by
Mp

the
submonoid

Note
that
each

p

where
p

is
closed
under
multiplication
by
elements

via
the
natural

Finally,
we
observe
that
the
relation
“≤”
on
elements

M
determines
a
category
Order(M

[via
the

Topological
Groups:
Let
G
be
a
Hausdorﬀ
topological
group,
and
H
⊆
G
a
closed
subgroup.
Let
us
write
def
ZG
(H)
=
{g
∈
G
|
g
·
h
=
h
·
g,
∀
h
∈
H}
for
the
centralizer
of
H
in
G.
If
Π
is
a
proﬁnite
group,
then
we
shall
write
B(Π)
for
the
category
whose
objects
are
ﬁnite
sets
equipped
with
a
continuous
Π-action
and
whose
morphisms
are
morphisms
of
Π-sets.
Thus,
B(Π)
is
a
Galois
category,
or,
in
the
terminology
of
[Mzk7],
a
connected
anabelioid.
If
ZΠ
(H)
=
{1}
for
every
open
subgroup
H
⊆
Π,
then
we
shall
say
that
Π
is

Categories:
Let
C
be
a
category.
We
shall
denote
the
collection
of
objects
(respectively,
arrows)
of
C
by:
Ob(C)
(respectively,
Arr(C))
The
opposite
category
to
C
will
be
denoted
by
C

.
A
category
with
precisely
one
object
will
be
referred
to
as
a
one-object
category;
a
category
with
precisely
one
morphism
[which
is
necessarily
the
identity
morphism
of
the
unique
object
of
such
a
category]
will
be
referred
to
as
a
one-morphism
category.
Thus,
a
one-morphism
category
is
always
a
one-object
category.
If
A
∈
Ob(C)
is
an
object
of
C,
then
we
shall
denote
by
CA
the
category
whose
objects
are
morphisms
B
→
A
of
C
and
whose
morphisms
[from
an
object
B1
→
A
to
an
object
B2
→
A]
are
A-morphisms
B1
→
B2
in
C
and
by
AC
the
category
whose
objects
are
morphisms
A
→
B
of
C
and
whose
morphisms
(from
an
object
A

B1
to
an

are
morphisms
B1
→
B2
in
C
that
are
compatible
with
the
given
arrows
A

B1
,
A

Thus,
we
have
a
natural
functor
(jA
)!
:
CA

C
[given
by
forgetting
the
structure
morphism
to
A].
Similarly,
if
f
:
A

B
is
a
morphism
in
C,
then
f
deﬁnes
a
natural
functor
f!
:
CA

an

C

to
the

given
by

C

We
shall

there
exists
a

(respectively,
there
exists
a
[not
necessarily

arrow)
B

We
shall

that
two
arrows
of
a

are
co-objective
if
their
domains
and
codomains
coincide.
We
shall

an

β
:

of
a
category
C
is
ﬁberwise-surjective
if,
for

there

δB

such
that

An
arrow
of
a
category
which
is
a
ﬁberwise-surjective
monomorphism
will
be
referred
to
as
an
FSM-morphism.
One
veriﬁes
immediately
that
every
composite
of
FSM-morphisms
is
again
an
FSM-morphism.
A
category
C
which
satisﬁes
the
property
that
every
FSM-morphism
of
C
is,
in
fact,
an
isomorphism
will
be
referred
to
as
a
category
of
FSM-type.
Let
C
be
a
category;
A
∈
Ob(C).
Write
EndC
(A);
AutC
(A)
for
the
monoids
of
endomorphisms
and
automorphisms
of
A
in
C,
respectively.
We
shall
say
that
an
endomorphism
α

is
a

there

C

(respectively,

If
every
object
of
C
is
Aut-saturated
(respectively,

-saturated;
of

then
we
shall
say
that
C
is
Aut-saturated
(respectively,
Autsub

of
Aut-type).
We
shall
say
that
an
arrow
A
→
B
of
C
is
an
End-equivalence
if
there
exists
an
arrow
B
→
A
in
C.
We
shall
refer
to
a
natural
transformation
between
functors
all
of
whose
component
morphisms
are
isomorphisms
as
an
isomorphism
between
the
functors
in
question.
If
φ
:
C1
→
C2
is
a
functor
between
categories
C1
,
C2
,
then
we
shall
denote
by
Aut(φ)
—
or,
when
there
is
no
fear
of
confusion,
Aut(C1
→
C2
)
—
the
group
of
automorphisms
of
the
functor
φ,
and
by
End(φ)
—
or,
when
there
is
no
fear
of
confusion,
End(C1
→
C2
)
—
the
monoid
of
natural
transformations
from
the
functor
φ
to
itself.
We
shall
say
that
φ
is
rigid
if
Aut(φ)
is
trivial.
A
category
C
will
be
called
slim
if
the
natural
functor
CA
→
C
is
rigid,
for
every
A
∈
Ob(C).
We
recall
that
if
Π
is

group,
then
Π
is
slim
if
and
only
if
the
category
B(Π)
is
slim
[cf.
[Mzk7],
Corollary
1.1.6].
A
diagram
of
functors
between
categories
will
be
called
1-commutative
if
the
various
composite
functors
in
question
are
isomorphic.
When
such
a
diagram
“commutes
in
the
literal
sense”
we
shall
say
that
it
0-commutes.
Note
that
when
a
diagram
in
which
the
various
composite
functors
are
all
rigid
“1-commutes”,
it
follows
from
the
rigidity
hypothesis
that
any
isomorphism
between
the
composite
functors
in
question
is
necessarily
unique.
Thus,
to
state
that
such
a
diagram
1-commutes
does
not
result
in
any
“loss
of
information”
by
comparison
to
the
datum
of
a
speciﬁc
isomorphism
between
the
various
composites
in
question.
A
category
C
will
be
called
a
skeleton
if
any
two
isomorphic
objects
of
C
are,
in
fact,
equal.
A
skeletal
subcategory
of
a
category
C
is
a
full
subcategory
S
⊆
C
such
that
S
is
a
skeleton,
and,
moreover,
the
inclusion
functor
S
→
C
is
an
equivalence
of
categories.
We
shall
say
that
a
nonempty
[i.e.,
non-initial]
object
A
∈
Ob(C)
is
connected
if
it
is
not
isomorphic
to
the
coproduct
of
two
nonempty
objects
of
C.
We
shall
say
that
an
object
A
∈
Ob(C)
is
mobile
if
there
exists
an
object
B
∈
Ob(C)
such
that
the
set
HomC
(A,
B)
has
cardinality
≥
2
[i.e.,
the
diagonal
from
this
set
to
the
product
of
this
set
with
itself
is
not
bijective].
We
shall
say
that
an
object
A
∈
Ob(C)
is
quasi-connected
if
it
is
either
immobile
[i.e.,
not
mobile]
or
connected.
Thus,
connected
objects
are
always
quasi-connected.
We
shall
say
that
a
category
C
is
totally
(respectively,
almost
totally)
epimorphic
if
every
morphism
in
C
whose
domain
is
arbitrary
(respectively,
nonempty)
and
whose
codomain
is
arbitrary
(respectively,
connected)
is
an
epimorphism.
We
shall
say
that
C
is
of
ﬁnitely
(respectively,
countably)
connected
type
if
it
is
closed
under
formation
of
ﬁnite
(respectively,
countable)
coproducts;
every
object
of
C
is
a
coproduct
of
a
ﬁnite
(respectively,
countable)
collection
of
connected
objects;
and,
moreover,
all
ﬁnite
(respectively,
countable)
coproducts
Ai
in
the
category
satisfy
the
condition
that
the
natural
map
HomC
(B,
Ai)
→
HomC
(B,
Ai
)
is
bijective,
for
all
connected
B
∈
Ob(C).
If
C
is
of
ﬁnitely
or
countably
connected
type,
then
every
nonempty
object
of
C
is
mobile;
in
particular,
a
nonempty
object
of
C
is
connected
if
and
only
if
it
is
quasi-connected.
If
a
mobile
object
A
∈
Ob(C)
satisﬁes
the
condition
that
every
morphism
in
C
whose
domain
is
nonempty
and
whose
codomain
is
A
is
an
epimorphism,
then
A
∼
is
connected.
[Indeed,
C1
C2
→
A,
where
C1
,
C2
are
nonempty,
implies
that
the
composite
map
HomC
(A,
B)
→
HomC
(A,
B)
×
HomC
(A,
B)
→
HomC
(C1

B)
×
HomC
(C2

B)
=
HomC
(C1
∼
C2
,
B)
→
HomC
(A,
B)
is
bijective,
for
all
B
∈
Ob(C).]
In
particular,
it
follows
that
if
C
is
a
totally
epimorphic
category,
then
every
object
of
C
is
quasi-connected.
16

If
C
is
a
category
of
ﬁnitely
or
countably
connected
type,
then
we
shall
write
C0
⊆
C
for
the
full
subcategory
of
connected
objects.
[Note,
however,
that
in
general,
objects
of
C
0
are
not
necessarily
connected
—
or
even
quasi-connected
—
as
objects
of
C
0
!]
On
the
other
hand,
if,
in
addition,
C
is
almost
totally
epimorphic,
then
C
0
is
totally
epimorphic
[so
every
object
of
C
is
quasi-connected].
If
C
is
a
category,
then
we
shall
write
C
⊥
(respectively,
C

)
for
the
category
formed
from
C
by
taking
arbitrary
“formal”
[possibly
empty]
ﬁnite
(respectively,
countable)
coproducts
of
objects
in
C.
That
is
to
say,
we
deﬁne
the
“Hom”
of
C
⊥
(respectively,
C

)
by
the
following
formula:
Hom(
def
Ai
,
i
Bj
)
=
j
HomC
(Ai
,
Bj
)
i
j
[where
the
Ai
,
Bj
are
objects
of
C].
Thus,
C
⊥
(respectively,
C

)
is
a
category
of
ﬁnitely
(respectively,
countably)
connected
type.
Note
that
objects
of
C
deﬁne
connected
objects
of
C
⊥
or
C

.
Moreover,
there
are
natural
[up
to
isomorphism]
equivalences
of
categories
∼
(C

)0
→
C;
∼
(C

)0

C;
∼
(D
0
)⊥

D;
∼
(E

→
E
for
D
(respectively,
E)
a
category
of
ﬁnitely
connected
type
(respectively,
category
of
countably
connected
type).
If
C
is
a
totally
epimorphic
category,
then
C
⊥
(respectively,
C

)
is
an
almost
totally
epimorphic
category
of
ﬁnitely
(respectively,
countably)
connected
type.
In
particular,
the
operations
“0”,
“⊥”
(respectively,
“”)
deﬁne
one-to-one
correspondences
[up
to
equivalence]
between
the
totally
epimorphic
categories
and
the
almost
totally
epimorphic
categories
of
ﬁnitely
(respectively,
countably)
connected
type.
We
observe
in
passing
that
if
C
is
a
totally
epimorphic
category,
and
α
◦
β
[where
α,
β
∈
Arr(C)]
is
an
isomorphism,
then
α,
β
are
isomorphisms.
If
C
is
a
[small]
category,
then
we
shall
write
G(C)
for
the
graph
associated
to
C.
This
graph
is
the
graph
with
precisely
one
vertex
for
each
object
of
C
and
precisely
one
edge
for
each
arrow
of
C
[joining
the
vertices
corresponding
to
the
domain
and
codomain
of
the
arrow].
We
shall
refer
to
the
full
subcategories
of
C
determined
by
the
objects
and
arrows
that
compose
a
connected
component
of
the
graph
G(C)
as
a

of
C.
In
particular,
we
shall
say
that
C
is
connected
if
G(C)
is
connected.
[Note
that
by
working
with
respect
to
some
“suﬃciently

enveloping

it
makes
sense
to

such
that

One
veriﬁes
easily
that
if
Φ2
is
an
equivalence,
then
the
natural
projection
functor
C1
×D
C2
→
C1
is
also
an
equivalence.
Let
C
be
a
category;
S
a
collection
of
arrows
in
C;
φ
∈
Arr(C).
Then
we
shall
say
that
φ
is
minimal-adjoint
to
S
(respectively,
minimal-coadjoint
to
S;
mid-adjoint
to
S)
if
every
factorization
φ
=
α
◦
β
(respectively,
φ
=
β
◦
α;
φ
=
α
◦
β
◦
γ)
of
φ
in
C
such
that
β
lies
in
S
satisﬁes
the
property
that
β
is,
in
fact,
an
isomorphism.
If
φ
admits
a
factorization
φ
=
α
◦
β
◦
γ
in
C,
then
we
shall
say
that
β
is
subordinate
to
φ.
If
φ
is
not
an
isomorphism,
but,
for
every
factorization
φ
=
α
◦
β
in
C,
it
holds
that
either
α
or
β
is
an
isomorphism,
then
we
shall
say
that
φ
is
irreducible.
We
shall
refer
to
an
FSM-morphism
which
is
irreducible
as
an
FSMI-morphism.
Thus,
a
category
of
FSM-type
does
not
contain
any
FSMI-morphisms.
We
shall
say
that
a
category
C
is
of
FSMFF-type
[i.e.,
“FSM-ﬁnitely
factorizable
type”]
if
the
following
two
conditions
hold:
(a)
every
FSM-morphism
of
C
which
is
not
an
isomorphism
factors
as
a
composite
of
ﬁnitely
many
FSMI-morphisms;
(b)
for
every
A
∈
Ob(C),
there
exists
a
natural
number
N
such
that

such
that
the

of

it
holds
that
n

.
Thus,
if
C
is
of
FSM-type,
then
it
is
of
FSMFF-type.
Also,
we
observe
that
[by
condition
(b)]
no
endomorphism
of
an
object
of
a
category
of
FSMFF-type
is
an
FSMI-morphism.
If
C
is
a
totally

category,
A

and
G

(A)
is
a

then
we
shall

that
an

φ

a
categorical
quotient
of
A
by
G
if
the
following
conditions
hold:
(a)
φ

φ,
for
all
γ

G;
(b)
for
every
morphism
ψ
:
A

such
that
ψ

for

G,
there
exists
a
unique
morphism
ψ

:

such
that
ψ
=
ψ

φ.
If
φ
:
A

B
is
a
categorical
quotient
of
A
by
G,
then
we
shall
say
that
A

if
the
following
condition
holds:
For
every

φ
=
φ
◦
ζ,
where
ζ

is
a

such
that
there
exists
a

G
⊆
AutC
(A
),
together
with
an
isomorphism
∼
G

G
that
is
compatible,
relative
to
ζ,
with
the
respective
actions
of
G,
G
on
A,
A
[which
implies,
by
total
epimorphicity,
that
φ
:
A

B
is
a
categorical
quotient
of
A
by
G
],
it
holds
that
ζ
is
an
isomorphism.
Thus,
[by
total
epimorphicity]
it
follows
that
an
isomorphism
is
always
a
mono-minimal
categorical
quotient
of
its

by
the

If

We

A

a

there
exists
an

A

where
B
is
an

If
C

then
we

THE
GEOMETRY
OF
FROBENIOIDS
I
19
Section
1:
Deﬁnitions
and
First
Properties
In
the
present
§1,
we
discuss
the
notion
of
a
Frobenioid,
which
may
be
thought
of
as
a
category
whose
internal
structure
behaves
roughly
like
that
of
an
“elementary
Frobenioid”.
An
“elementary
Frobenioid”
is,
in
essence,
a
sort
of
semi-direct
product
of
the
multiplicative
monoid
N≥1
[which
is
to
be
thought
of
as
a
“Frobenius
action”]
with
a
system
of
monoids
[which
are
roughly
of
the
sort
that
appear
in
the
theory
of
log
structures]
on
a
“base
category”
[a
category
which
behaves
roughly
like
a
Galois
category].
We
begin
by
introducing
the
fundamental
notions
of
“elementary
Frobenioids”
and
“pre-Frobenioids”.
Deﬁnition
1.1.
(i)
We
shall
say
that
M
∈
Ob(Mon)
is
pre-divisorial
if
it
is
integral
[cf.
§0],
saturated
[cf.
§0],
and
of
characteristic
type
[cf.
§0].
Suppose
that
M
is
predivisorial.
Then
we
shall
say
that
M
is
group-like
if
M
char
is
zero;
we
shall
say
that
M
is
divisorial
if
M
is
sharp
[cf.
§0].
[Thus,
if
M
is
pre-divisorial,
then
M
char
is
divisorial.]
If
α
is
an
endomorphism
of
a
pre-divisorial
monoid
M
∈
Ob(Mon),
then
we
shall
say
that
α
is
non-dilating
if
the
endomorphism
αchar
of
M
char
induced
by
α
is
the
identity
endomorphism
of
M
char
whenever
αchar
(a)

a
for
all
primary
[cf.
§0]
a
∈
M
char
.
(ii)
Let
D
be
a
category.
Then
we
shall
refer
to
a
contravariant
functor
Φ
:
D
→
Mon
as
a
monoid
on
D
if
the
following
conditions
are
satisﬁed:
(a)
every
morphism
of
monoids
α∗
:
Φ(A)
→
Φ(B)
induced
by
a
morphism
α
:
B
→
A
of
D
is
characteristically
injective
[cf.
§0];
(b)
if
α
is
an
FSM-morphism
[cf.
§0]
of
D,
then
α∗
:
Φ(A)
→
Φ(B)
is
an
isomorphism
of
monoids.
If,
moreover,
every
monoid
Φ(A)
[as
A
ranges
over
the
objects
of
D]
(respectively,
some
monoid
Φ(A)
[where
A
∈
Ob(D)])
satisﬁes
some
property
of
monoids
[e.g.,
is
pre-divisorial,
sharp,
etc.],
then
we
shall
say
that
Φ
(respectively,
A)
satisﬁes
this
property.
Note
that
if
Φ
is
a
monoid
on
D,
then
Φ
determines
monoids
“Φchar
”,
“Φgp
”,
Φpf
”
on
D
[i.e.,
by
assigning
A
→
Φ(A)char
,
A
→
Φ(A)gp
,
A
→
Φ(A)pf
],
which
we
shall
refer
to,
respectively,
as
the
characteristic,
groupiﬁcation,
and
perfection
of
Φ.
If
Φ
is
predivisorial,
then
we
shall
say
that
Φ
is
non-dilating
if
the
endomorphisms
of
Φ(A),
where
A
∈
Ob(D),
induced
by
endomorphisms
∈
EndD
(A)
are
non-dilating.
(iii)
Let
Φ
be
a
monoid
on
a
category
D.
Then
we
shall
refer
to
as
the
elementary
Frobenioid
associated
to
Φ
the
category
FΦ
20

deﬁned
as
follows:
The
objects
of
FΦ
are
the
objects
of
D.
If
A,
B
∈
Ob(FΦ
),
whose
respective
images
in
D
we
denote
by
AD
,
BD
∈
Ob(D),
then
a
morphism
φ
:
A
→
B
of
FΦ
is
deﬁned
to
be
a
collection
of
data
(φD
,
Zφ
,
nφ
)
where
φD
:
AD
→
BD
is
a
morphism
of
D;
Zφ
∈
Φ(AD
);
nφ
∈
N≥1
.
Here,
φD
(respectively,
AD
)
will
be
referred
to
as
the
projection
Base(φ)
(respectively,
Base(A))
of
φ
(respectively,
A)
to
D;
Zφ
as
the
zero
divisor
Div(φ)
of
φ;
and
nφ
as
def
the
Frobenius
degree
degFr
(φ)
of
φ.
If
CD
=
Base(C)
∈
Ob(D),
then
the
composite
of
two
morphisms
φ
=
(φD
,
Zφ
,
nφ
)
:
A
→
B;
ψ
=
(ψD
,
Zψ
,
nψ
)
:
B
→
C
is
given
as
follows:
ψ
◦
φ
=
(ψD
◦
φD
,
φ∗D
(Zψ
)
+
nψ
·
Zφ
,
nψ
·
nφ
)
:
A
→
C
Observe
that
the
assignment
Φ
→
FΦ
is
functorial
with
respect
to
homomorphisms
of
functors
[on
D]
valued
in
monoids
Φ
→
Φ
;
also,
we
have
a
natural
projection
functor:
FΦ
→
D
We
shall
refer
to
the
D
as
the
base
category
of
FΦ
.
If
M
∈
Ob(Mon),
then
observe
that
the
elementary
Frobenioid
FΦM
associated
to
the
functor
ΦM
on
any
onemorphism
[cf.
§0]
category
that
assigns
to
the
unique
object
of
the
category
the
monoid
M
is
itself
a
one-object
[cf.
§0]
category,
whose
endomorphism
monoid
we
shall
denote
by
FM
and
refer
to
as
the
elementary
Frobenioid
associated
to
M
.
[Thus,
the
notation
“F
”
denotes
a
category
(respectively,
monoid)
when
the
subscript
“”
is
a
functor
(respectively,
monoid).]
More
explicitly,
the
underlying
set
of
FM
is
the
product
M
×
N≥1
equipped
with
the
monoid
structure
is
given
as
follows:
if
a1
,
a2
∈
M
,
n1
,
n2
∈
N≥1
,
def
then
(a1
,
n1
)
·
(a2
,
n2
)
=
(a1
+
n1
·
a2
,
n1
·
n2
).
Also,
we
shall
write
F
=
FZ≥0
and
refer
to
F
as
the
standard
Frobenioid.
(iv)
Let
D,
Φ,
FΦ
be
as
in
(iii);
C
a
category.
Assume
further
that
Φ
is
divisorial,
and
that
C,
D
are
connected,
totally
epimorphic
categories
[cf.
§0].
Then
we
shall
refer
to
a
[covariant]
functor
C
→
FΦ
as
a
pre-Frobenioid
structure
on
C.
The
natural
projection
functor
FΦ
→
D
thus
restricts
to
a
natural
projection
functor
C→D
on
C;
similarly,
the
operations
“Base(−)”,
“Div(−)”,
“degFr
(−)”
on
FΦ
restrict
to
operations
on
C
which
[by
abuse
of
notation]
we
shall
denote
by
the
same
notation.
THE
GEOMETRY
OF
FROBENIOIDS
I
21
We
shall
refer
to
the
D
as
the
base
category
of
C.
By
abuse
of
notation,
we
shall
often
regard
Φ
as
a
functor
on
C
[i.e.,
by
composing
the
original
functor
Φ
with
the
natural
projection
functor
C
→
D]
and
apply
similar
terminology
to
objects
of
C
and
“Φ
as
a
functor
on
C”
to
the
terminology
applied
to
objects
of
D
and
“Φ
as
a
functor
on
D”
[cf.
(ii)].
We
shall
refer
to
a
category
C
equipped
with
a
pre-Frobenioid
structure
C
→
FΦ
as
a
pre-Frobenioid
and
to
the
monoid
Φ
as
the
divisor
monoid
of
the
pre-Frobenioid.
Remark
1.1.1.
If
φ
◦
ψ
is
a
composite
of
morphisms
φ,
ψ
of
a
pre-Frobenioid,
then
the
operations
“Base(−)”,
“Div(−)”,
“degFr
(−)”
behave
in
the
following
way
under
composition:
Base(φ
◦
ψ)
=
Base(φ)
◦
Base(ψ)
Div(φ
◦
ψ)
=
(Base(ψ))∗
(Div(φ))
+
degFr
(φ)
·
Div(ψ)
degFr
(φ
◦
ψ)
=
degFr
(φ)
·
degFr
(ψ)
Indeed,
this
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
an
elementary
Frobenioid
in
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(iii).
Next,
we
introduce
various
terms
to
describe
types
of
morphisms
and
objects
in
a
pre-Frobenioid.
Deﬁnition
1.2.
Let
Φ
be
a
divisorial
monoid
on
a
connected,
totally
epimorphic
category
D;
C
→
FΦ
a
pre-Frobenioid;
φ
∈
Arr(C).
Write
φ
:

[where
def
def
A,
B
∈
Ob(C)];
AD
=
Base(A)
∈
Ob(D),
BD
=
Base(B)
∈
Ob(D).
Then:
(i)
We
shall
say
that
φ
is
linear
if
degFr
(φ)
=
1.
We
shall
say
that
φ
is
isometric,
or,
alternatively,
an
isometry,
if
Div(φ)
=
0
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(iii)].
If
ψ
∈
Arr(C)
is
co-objective
with
φ
[cf.
§0],
then
we
shall
say
that
φ,
ψ
are
metrically
equivalent
if
Div(φ)
=
Div(ψ).
(ii)
We
shall
refer
to
φ
as
a
base-isomorphism
(respectively,
base-FSM-morphism)
if
Base(φ)
is
an
isomorphism
(respectively,
FSM-morphism
[cf.
§0])
in
D.
We
shall
refer
to
two
objects
of
C
that
map
to
isomorphic
objects
of
D
as
base-isomorphic.
We
shall
refer
to
φ
as
a
pull-back
morphism
if
the
natural
transformation
of
contravariant
functors
on
C
HomC
(−,
A)
→
HomC
(−,
B)
×HomD
(−,BD

(HomD

[where
“|C

denotes
the

of
a

on
D
to
a
functor
on
C
via
the
natural
projection
functor
C
→
D]
induced
by
φ
is
an
isomorphism.
If
ψ
∈
Arr(C)
is
coobjective
with
φ
[cf.
§0],
then
we
shall
say
that
φ,
ψ
are
base-equivalent
(respectively,
Div-equivalent)
if
Base(φ)
=
Base(ψ)
(respectively,
Φ(φ)
=
Φ(ψ)).
If
A
=
B
[i.e.,
φ
is
an
endomorphism],
then
we
shall
say
that
φ
is
a
base-identity
(respectively,
22

Div-identity)
endomorphism
if
it
is
base-equivalent
(respectively,
Div-equivalent)
to
the
identity
endomorphism
of
A.
Write
O×
(A)
⊆
AutC
(A);
O
(A)
⊆
EndC
(A)
for
the
submonoids
of
base-identity
linear
endomorphisms.
(iii)
We
shall
say
that
φ
is
a
pre-step
[a
term
motivated
by
the
point
of
view
that
the
only
possibly
non-isomorphic
portion
of
such
a
morphism
is
the
“step”
constituted
by
a
non-zero
zero
divisor]
if
it
is
a
linear
base-isomorphism.
If
φ
is
a
pre-step,
then
we
shall
say
that
it
is
a
step
(respectively,
a
primary
pre-step)
if
φ
is
not
an
isomorphism
(respectively,
if
the
zero
divisor
Div(φ)
∈
Φ(A)
of
φ
is
a
primary
[cf.
§0]
element
of
the
monoid
Φ(A)).
We
shall
say
that
φ
is
co-angular
[a
term
that
arises
from
a
certain
“coincidence
of
angles”
that
occurs
for
co-angular
morphisms
in
the
case
of
Frobenioids
that
arise
in
an
archimedean
context
—
cf.
[Mzk15],
Deﬁnition
3.1,

if,
for
any
factorization
φ
=
α
◦
β
◦
γ
in
C,
where
α
is
linear,
β
is
an
isometric
pre-step,
and
either
α
or
γ
is
a
base-isomorphism,
it
follows
that
β
is
an
isomorphism.
We
shall
say
that
φ
is
LB-invertible
[i.e.,
“line
bundleinvertible”
—
a
term
motivated
by
the
isomorphism
induced
by
such
a
morphism
between
the
“image

(iii)
Suppose
that

is
a
Frobenioid.
Then
every
LB-invertible
pre-step
is
an
isomorphism.
(iv)
Suppose
that
C
is
a
Frobenioid.
Then
a
morphism
φ
of
C
is
co-angular
if
and
only
if,
in
the
factorization
φ
=
α
◦
β
◦
γ
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iv),
(a),
the
pre-step
β
is
co-angular.
(v)
Suppose
that
C
is
a
Frobenioid.
Then
a
morphism
φ
of
C
is
LB-invertible
if
and
only
if
it
is
of
the
form
α
◦
β,
where
α
is
a
pull-back
morphism,
and
β
is
a
morphism
of
Frobenius
type.
Proof.
Assertion
(i)
follows
formally
from
the
deﬁnitions
of
the
terms
“isotropic”,
“isometric
pre-step”,
“co-angular”,
and
“morphism
of
Frobenius
type”
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.2,
(i),
(iii),
(iv)].
As
for
assertion
(ii),
if
φ
is
a
pull-back
morphism,
then
it
follows
from
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iv),
(b),
that
φ
is
an
LB-invertible
linear
morphism.
Now
suppose
that
φ
is
LB-invertible
and
linear.
Then
by
applying
Remark
1.1.1
to
the
factorization
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iv),
(a),
the
fact
that
φ
is
a
linear
isometry
implies
that
φ
may
be
written
in
the
form
α
◦
β,
where
α
is
a
pull-back
morphism,
and
β
is
an
isometric
pre-step.
On
the
other
hand,
since
φ
is
co-angular,
it
follows
that
β
is
an
isomorphism,
hence
that
φ
is
a
pull-back
morphism,
as
desired.
Assertion
(iii)
follows
from
either
the
uniqueness
of
the
factorization
of
pre-steps
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(v),
(b),
or
the
essential
uniqueness
of
morphisms
of
Frobenius
type
of
a
given
Frobenius
degree
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(ii)].
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iv).
If
β
is
co-angular,
then
since
α,
γ
are
coangular
[cf.
assertion
(ii);
Deﬁnition
1.2,
(iii)],
it
follows
from
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(a),
that
φ
is
co-angular.
Conversely,
if
φ
is
co-angular,
and
β
=
β1
◦
β2
◦
β3
,
where
β2
is
an
isometric
pre-step,
then
by
applying
Remark
1.1.1,
together
with
the
fact
that
D
is
totally
epimorphic
[cf.
the
discussion
of
§0]
to
this
factorization
of
β,
we
conclude
that
β1
,
β3
are
pre-steps,
hence
that
α
◦
β1
is
linear,
and
that
β3
◦
γ
is
a
base-isomorphism;
thus,
the
co-angularity
of
φ
=
(α
◦
β1
)
◦
β2
◦
(β3
◦
γ)
implies
that
β2
is
an
isomorphism,
hence
that
β
is
co-angular,
as
desired.
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(v).
If
φ
=
α◦β,
where
α
is
a
pull-back
morphism,
and
β
is
a
morphism
of
Frobenius
type,
then
[since
α,
β
are
LB-invertible
—
cf.
assertion
(ii);
Deﬁnition
1.2,
(iii)]
it
follows
from
Remark
1.1.1
that
φ
is
isometric
and
from
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(a),
that
φ
is
co-angular,
hence
LB-invertible.
Now
suppose
that
φ
is
LB-invertible,
and
that
we
have
a
factorization
φ
=
α◦β
◦γ,
where
α,
β,
and
γ
are
as
in
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iv),
(a).
By
assertion
(iv),
β
is
co-angular;
by
Remark
1.1.1,
β
is
isometric.
Thus,
β
is
an
LB-invertible
pre-step,
hence
[cf.
assertion
(iii)]
an
isomorphism,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(v).

THE
GEOMETRY
OF
FROBENIOIDS
I
27
Proposition
1.5.
(Elementary
Frobenioids
are
Frobenioids)
Let
Φ
be
a
pre-divisorial
monoid
on
a
connected,
totally
epimorphic
category
D.
Then:
(i)
FΦ
,
equipped
with
the
natural
functor
FΦ
→
FΦchar
,
is
a
Frobenioid
of
Autample,
Autsub
-ample,
End-ample,
base-trivial,
Frobenius-trivial,
Frobeniusnormalized,
and
isotropic
type.
(ii)
There
is
a
natural,
functorial
isomorphism
∼
O
(A)
→
Φ(A)
∼
[so
O×
(A)
→
Φ(A)±
]
for
objects
A
∈
Ob(FΦ
).
(iii)
If
all
of
the
monoids
in
the
image
of
Φ
are
perfect
(respectively,
grouplike),
then
FΦ
is
of
perfect
(respectively,
group-like)
type.
Proof.
Since
D
is
a
connected,
totally
epimorphic
category,
the
fact
that
FΦ
is
as
well
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
the
morphisms
of
FΦ
in
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(iii);
the
fact
that
a
pre-divisorial
monoid
is
integral
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(i)];
and
the
injectivity
condition
of
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(ii),
(a).
Thus,
FΦ
is
a
preFrobenioid.
It
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
assertion
(ii)
holds,
and
that
all
objects
of
FΦ
are
Aut-ample,
Autsub
-ample,
End-ample,
base-trivial,
Frobeniustrivial,
Frobenius-normalized,
and
isotropic.
Also,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
[cf.
the
deﬁnition
of
the
category
FΦ
in
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(iii)]
that
a
morphism
of
FΦ
is
a
pull-back
morphism
if
and
only
if
it
is
a
linear
isometry.
The
fact
that
FΦ
satisﬁes
the
conditions
of
Deﬁnition
1.3
now
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
the
category
FΦ
in
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(iii),
together
with
assertion
(ii)
and
the
“explicit
description”
of
co-angular
morphisms
and
morphisms
of
Frobenius
type
in
Proposition
1.4,
(i)
[which
is
applicable
to
all
morphisms
of
FΦ
since
FΦ
is
of
isotropic
type].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Assertion
(iii)
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions
and
assertion
(i).

One
important
technique
for
constructing
new
Frobenioids
is
given
by
the
following
result.
Proposition
1.6.
(Categorical

Let
Φ
be
a
divisorial
monoid
on
a
connected,
totally
epimorphic

D;
C

a
Frobenioid.
Let
D

be
a

Denote

by
restricting
Φ
to


.
Then:
(i)
There
is
a
natural
equivalence
of
categories
∼
FΦ
→
FΦ
×D
D

[where
the
latter
category

(iii)
A

(respectively,

if
and
only
if
its

is
a

and

Moreover,
the

a

of
monoids

for
every
A

)
that
projects
to
A
∈
Ob(C).
(v)
A
object
of
C

is
Frobenius-trivial
(respectively,
quasi-Frobenius-trivial;
sub-quasi-Frobenius-trivial;
metrically
trivial;
base-trivial;
perfect;

Frobenius-normalized;

if
and
only
if
it
projects
to

(vi)
A

(respectively,

if
it
projects
to

of

Proof.
Assertion
(i)
follows
formally
from
the
deﬁnitions.
Next,
observe
that
the
fact
that
D

is
a
totally
epimorphic
category
implies
immediately
that
C

is
as
well;
similarly,
[in
light
of
the
various
properties
of
the
natural
projection
functor
C
→
D
assumed
in
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(i),
(a),
(b),
(c)]
the
fact
that
D

is
connected
implies
immediately
that
C

is
also
connected.
Thus,
C

[equipped
with
the

obtained
by
applying
“(−)

D

”
to
the
functor

]
is
a
preFrobenioid.
Now
assertion
(vi)
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions;
one
checks
immediately
that
the
equivalences
of
assertions
(iii),
(iv),
(v)
hold.
In
light
of
these
equivalences,
the
conditions
of
Deﬁnition
1.3
follow
via
a

Thus,
C

is
a
Frobenioid.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).

(iii)
A

type
if

A

(iv)
A

then

If,
moreover,
the
domain
of
φ
is
isotropic,
then
a
similar
statement
holds
for
morphisms
of
Frobenius

Proof.
Assertion
(i)
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions
for
isometries,
baseisomorphisms,
base-FSM-morphisms,
pull-back
morphisms,
linear
morphisms,
and
pre-steps;
from
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(a),
for
co-angular
morphisms,
hence
also
for
LB-invertible
morphisms
and
morphisms
of
Frobenius
type.
Next,
the
suﬃciency
of
the
various
conditions
given
in
assertions
(ii),
(iii)
follows
immediately
from
[deﬁnitions
and]
the
[existence
of
the]
factorization
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iv),
(a).
Moreover,
in
light
of
the
existence
of
this
factorization,
the
necessity
of
the
various
conditions
given
in
assertions
(ii),
(iii)
follows
immediately
for
pull-back
morphisms
and
morphisms
of
Frobenius
type
from
the
essential
uniqueness
of
this
factorization
[and
the
total
epimorphicity
of
C];
for
base-isomorphisms
from
the
total
epimorphicity
of
D;
and
for
linear
morphisms
from
the
well-known
structure
of
the
multiplicative
monoid
N≥1
and
the
essential
uniqueness
of
morphisms
of
Frobenius
type
of
a
given
Frobenius
degree
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,

In
light
of
Remark
1.1.1,
assertion
(v)
follows
for
isomorphisms
(respectively,
base-isomorphisms;
linear
morphisms;
pre-steps;
isometries)
immediately
from
the
fact
that
C
is
totally
epimorphic
(respectively,
from
the
fact
that
D

epimorphic;
from
the
well-known

together
with
the

Now
assertion
(iv)
follows
formally
from
[the
deﬁnitions
and]
assertion
(v)
for
pre-steps
[cf.
the
argument
applied
in
the
proof
of
Proposition

(iv)!];
assertion
(v)
for
co-angular
pre-steps
follows
from
assertion
(v)
for
pre-steps
and
assertion
(iv).
To
prove
assertion
(v)
for
coangular
linear
morphisms,
suppose
that
φ
is
co-angular
and
linear.
Then
observe
that
by
assertion
(v)
for

α,
β
are
linear.
Thus,
by
applying
the
factorization
for
linear
morphisms
of
assertion
(iii),
together
with
the
factorization
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(v),
(c)
[cf.
also
Proposition
1.4,

assertion
(i)
for

we
may
write
α
=
α1

α2
,
β
=
β1
◦
β2
,
α2
◦
β1
=
γ1
◦
γ2
,
where
α1
,
β1
,
γ1
are
co-angular
linear
morphisms,
and
α2
,
β2
,
γ2
are
isometric
pre-steps.
30
SHINICHI

Thus,
φ
=
(α1
◦
γ1
)
◦
(γ2
◦
β2
),
which
[by
the
co-angularity
of
φ]
implies
that
γ2
◦
β2
is
an
isomorphism,
hence
[by
assertion
(v)
for
isomorphisms]
that
β2
,
γ2
are
isomorphisms.
Thus,
by
the
co-angularity
of
α2
◦
β1
=
γ1
◦
γ2
,
we
conclude
that
α2
is
an
isomorphism.
In
particular,
it
follows
that
α,
β
are
co-angular
linear
morphisms,
as
desired.
Now
assertion
(v)
for
pull-back
morphisms
follows
from
assertion
(v)
for
co-angular
linear
isometries
[cf.
also
Proposition
1.4,
(ii)].
Finally,
assertion
(v)
for
morphisms
of
Frobenius
type
in
C
istr
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(vii),
(b)]
follows
from
assertion
(v)
for
isometric
base-isomorphisms,
since
morphisms
of
C
istr
are
always
co-angular
[cf.
Proposition
1.4,
(i)].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(v).

Proposition
1.8.
(Pre-steps)
Let
Φ
be
a
divisorial
monoid
on
a

totally
epimorphic

D;
C
→
FΦ

Frobenioid.
Then:
(i)
If
the
natural
projection
functor
C

D
is
full,
then
every
pre-step
of

a

End-equivalence.
If
D
is
of
Aut-type
[cf.
§0],
then
every
linear
End-equivalence
of
C
is
a
pre-step.
(ii)
Suppose
further
that
C
is
of
metrically
trivial
and
Aut-ample
type.
Then
a
morphism
of
C
is
a
co-angular
pre-step
if
and
only
if
it
is
abstractly
equivalent
[cf.
§0]
to
a
base-identity
pre-step
endomorphism
of
C.
(iii)
An
object
A
∈
Ob(C)
is
non-group-like
if
and
only
if
there
exists
a
co-angular
step
A

alternatively,
an
object
A
∈
Ob(C)
is
non-group-like
if
and
only
if
there
exists
a
co-angular
step
B
→
A.
Also,
if
A,
B
∈
Ob(C)
are
base-isomorphic
objects,
then
A
is
group-like
if
and
only
if
B
is.
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
If
φ
∈
Arr(C)
is
a
pre-step,
and
the
projection
functor
C
→
D
is
full,
then
the
fact
that
it
is
a
linear
End-equivalence
follows
formally
from
the
deﬁnition
of
a
“pre-step”
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.2,
(iii)];
the
fullness
assumption
on
C
→
D.
On
the
other
hand,
if
φ
∈
Arr(C)
is
a
linear
End-equivalence,
and
D
is
of
Aut-type,
then
it
follows
formally
that
φ
is
a
baseisomorphism,
hence
a
pre-step,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
If
φ
∈
Arr(C)
is
a
co-angular
pre-step,
then
it
follows
formally
from
the
assumption
that
C
is
of
metrically
trivial
and
Aut-ample
type
that
φ
is
abstractly
equivalent
to
a
base-identity
pre-step
endomorphism
of
C.
On
the
other
hand,
if
φ
∈
Arr(C)
is
abstractly
equivalent
to
a
base-identity
pre-step
endomorphism
of
C
[hence
co-angular,
by
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(b)],
then
it
follows
formally
that
φ
is
a
co-angular
linear
base-isomorphism,
hence
that
φ
is
a
co-angular
pre-step,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Finally,
we
observe
that
the
various
equivalences
of
assertion
(iii)
follow
formally
from
the
deﬁnitions
and
the
equivalences
of
categories
of

Proof.
Since
pull-backs
which
are
base-isomorphisms
are
easily
veriﬁed
to
be
isomorphisms
[cf.
Remark
1.2.1],
assertion
(i)
follows
immediately
from
the
(essentially)
unique
factorization
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iv),
(a);
the
(essentially)
unique
factorization
of
pre-steps
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(v),
(b);
the
fact
that
co-angular
morphisms
are
closed
under
composition
[cf.
Proposition
1.7,
(i)];
the
deﬁnition
of
“co-angular”
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.2,
(iii)];
the
fact
that
C
is
totally
epimorphic;
the
essential
uniqueness
of
morphisms
of
Frobenius
type
of
a
given
Frobenius
degree
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(ii)];
and
Remark
1.1.1.
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
The
existence
of
the
functor
φ∗
follows
formally
from
the
existence
of
the
(essentially)
unique
factorization
of
assertion
(i).
Now
suppose
that
φ
is
a
co-angular
pre-step.
Then
for
any
isometric
pre-step
β
:
D
→
B,
there
exists
a
co-angular
pre-step
ψ
:
C
→
D
such
that
(Φ(β
◦
ψ))−1
(Div(ψ)))
=
(Φ(φ))−1
(Div(φ))
[cf.
the
second
equivalence
of
categories
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d)].
Thus,
by
applying
the
factorization
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(v),
(c),
it
follows
that
we
may
write
β
◦
ψ
=
φ
◦
α
,
where
α
:
D
→
A
is
an
isometric
pre-step,
and
φ
:
A
→
B
is
a

co-angular
pre-step.
On
the
other
hand,
since
Div(β
◦
ψ)
=
Div(φ
◦
α
),
and
β,
α
are
isometric,
it
follows
that
(Φ(φ))−1
(Div(φ))
=
(Φ(φ
))−1
(Div(φ
))
—
hence
[by
the
second
equivalence
of
categories
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d)]
that
∼
there
exists
an
isomorphism
γ
:
A
→
A
such
that
φ
◦
γ
=
φ
.
Thus,
if
we
take
def
α
=
γ
◦α
,
then
β
◦ψ
=
φ◦α
—
that
is
to
say,
φ∗
is
essentially
surjective.
Moreover,
[by
possibly
replacing
φ
by
ψ]
this
argument
[i.e.,
the
construction,
given
β,
φ,
of
α,
ψ
such
that
β
◦
ψ
=
φ
◦
α]
also
implies
that
φ∗
is
full.
Finally,
since
every
pre-step
is
a
monomorphism
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(v),
(a)],
it
follows
immediately
that
φ∗
is
faithful.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Assertion
(iii)
follows
formally
from
the
deﬁnitions,
together
with
the
fact
that
pull-back
morphisms
are
linear
isometries
[cf.
Proposition
1.4,
(ii)],
which
implies
[cf.
Remark
1.1.1]
that
γ
is
an
isometric
pre-step.
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iv).
Let
φ
:
A
→
B
be
a
co-angular
linear
morphism.
If
A
is
isotropic,
then
so
is
B,
by
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(vii),
(b).
Now
suppose
that
B
is
isotropic.
Thus,
by
the
deﬁnition
of
an
isotropic
hull,
it
follows
from
the
existence
of
isotropic
hulls
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(vii),
(a)]
that
there
exists
a
factorization
φ
=
β
◦
α,
where
α
:
A
→
A
is
an
isotropic
hull
[hence
an
isometric
pre-step
—
cf.
Deﬁnition
1.2,
(iv)],
and
β
:
A
→
B
is
linear
[cf.
Remark
1.1.1].
Thus,
by
the
deﬁnition
of
“co-angular”
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.2,
(iii)],
we
conclude
that
α
is
an
isomorphism,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iv).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(v).
By
applying
the
deﬁnition
of
an
isotropic
hull
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.2,
(iv)],
it
follows
immediately
[from
the
fact
that
C
is
connected
and
totally
epimorphic]
that
C
istr
is
connected
and
totally
epimorphic.
Thus,
C
istr
is
a
pre-Frobenioid.
It
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnition
of
an
isotropic
hull
that
the
isotropiﬁcation
functor
is
left
adjoint
to
the
inclusion
functor
C
istr
→
C;
that
the
functor
C
→
FΦ
factors
through
the
isotropiﬁcation
functor
[cf.
Remark
1.1.1];
that
the
restriction
of
the
isotropiﬁcation
functor
to
C
istr
is
isomorphic
to
the
identity
functor;
and
[cf.
Remark
1.1.1]
that
the
isotropiﬁcation
functor
preserves
Frobenius
degrees,
pre-steps,
base-isomorphisms,
base-FSM-morphisms,
base-identity
endomorphisms,
Div-identity
endomorphisms,
isometries,
and
co-angular
morphisms
[cf.
Proposition
1.4,
(i)],
hence
also
LB-invertible
morphisms
and
morphisms
of
Frobenius
type
in
a
fashion
that
is
compatible
[cf.
the
statement
of
assertion
(v)]
with
the
inclusion
C
istr
→
C.
Since
pull-back
morphisms
are
co-angular
linear
isometries
[cf.
Proposition
1.4,
(ii)],
it
follows
immediately
[in
light
of
what
we
have
shown
so
far]
from
Proposition
1.4,
(ii),
that
the
isotropiﬁcation
functor
maps
pull-back
morphisms
to
morphisms
which
are
pull-back
morphisms
relative
to
C,
hence
a
fortiori,
pull-back
morphisms
relative
to
C
istr
.
Finally,
in
light
of
Proposition
1.4,
(i);
assertion
(iv)
[cf.
also
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(vii),
(b)],
it
follows
immediately
[from
the
fact
that
C
is
a
Frobenioid!]
that
the
pre-Frobenioid
C
istr
satisﬁes
the
various
conditions
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
hence
that
C
istr
is
a
Frobenioid,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(v).
Finally,
we
observe
that
the
necessity
and
suﬃciency
of
the
condition
of
assertion
(vi)
follow
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
an
isotropic
hull
[cf.

and
the
total
epimorphicity
of
C;
the
necessity
and
suﬃciency
of
the
condition
of
assertion
(vii)
follow
immediately
from
the
existence
of

[cf.

the
fact
that

Proposition

and
the
following
observation
[which
follows
immediately
from
Proposition

(v)]:
Given

α,
β,
γ

that

if
any
two
of

then
the

is

of

(Morphisms

Let

Then:

Suppose

Finally,
if

Suppose

Then
the

(v)
A

if
and

if
it
is
a
composite
of

The

of
sub-quasi-Frobenius-trivial
type.
Moreover,
every
group-like
object
A
∈

)
is
Frobenius-trivial.
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
Observe
that
uniqueness
follows
from
the
fact
that
C
is
totally
epimorphic.
Now
it
suﬃces
to
prove
the
existence
of
φ
as
desired,
ﬁrst
in
the
case
where
φ
is
a
morphism
of
Frobenius
type,
then
in
the
case
where
φ
is
a
pre-step,
and
ﬁnally
in
the
case
where
φ
is
a
pull-back
morphism
[cf.
the
factorization
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iv),
(a)].
In
the
ﬁrst
case,
since
morphisms
of
Frobenius
type
are
closed
under
composition,
with
multiplying
Frobenius
degrees
[cf.
Proposition
1.7,
(i);
Remark
1.1.1],
the
existence
of
a
morphism
of
Frobenius
type
φ
as
desired
follows
immediately
from
the
existence
and
(essential)
uniqueness
of
morphisms
of
Frobenius
type
of
a
given
Frobenius
degree
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(ii)].
In
the
case
where
φ
is
a
pre-step,
the
existence
of
a
pre-step
φ
[which,
moreover,
is
co-angular
if
φ
is]
as
desired
follows
immediately
from
the
factorization
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iv),
(a)
[cf.
also
Proposition
1.4,
(iv)],
together
with
the
(essential)
uniqueness
of
morphisms
of
Frobenius
type
of
a
given
Frobenius
degree
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(ii)],
and
the
fact
that
co-angular
morphisms
are
closed
under
composition
[cf.
Proposition
1.7,
(i)].
In
a
similar
vein,
since
pull-back
morphisms
are
LB-invertible
[cf.
Proposition
1.4,
(ii)],
and
LB-invertible
morphisms
are
closed
under
composition
[cf.
Proposition
1.7,
(i)],
the
existence
of
a
pull-back
morphism
φ
in
the
case
where
φ
is
a
pull-back
morphism
follows
immediately
from
the
factorization
of
Proposition
1.4,
(v),
together
with
the
(essential)
uniqueness
of
morphisms
of
Frobenius
type
of
a
given
Frobenius
degree
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(ii)].
The
portion
of
assertion
(i)
concerning
“degFr
(−)”,
“Div(−)”
then
follows
immediately
from
Remark
1.1.1.
Finally,
in
light
of
what
we
have
done
so
far,
the
fact
that
“if
φ
is
a(n)
co-angular
morphism
(respectively,
base-isomorphism;
isometry;
LB-invertible
morphism),
then
the
same
is
true
of
φ
”
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions;
Remark
1.1.1;
the
factorization
of
co-angular
morphisms
given
in
Proposition
1.4,
(iv);
and
the
fact
that
co-angular
morphisms
are
closed
under

[cf.

This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Now
[in

of

of
Frobenius
type
of
a
given
Frobenius
degree
—
cf.
Deﬁnition

assertion
(ii)
follows
formally
from
assertion
(i).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
In

the

immediately
[cf.

from

[cf.

Now
suppose
further
that

[so
all
morphisms
of

are
co-angular

Then
by

the
isomorphism

we
may
assume
that

Now
the

to

Next,
we
observe
that
assertion
(iv)
follows
immediately
from
Proposition
1.7,
(v),
and
the
well-known
structure
of
the
multiplicative
monoid
N≥1
[cf.
also
Definition
1.3,
(ii)],
and
that
assertion
(v)
follows
immediately
from
Proposition
1.7,
(i);
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(ii).
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(vi).
Let
A
∈
Ob(C
istr
).
Then
by
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(i),
(a),
(b)
[applied
to
the
Frobenioid

istr
—
cf.
Proposition
1.9,

there
exist

Proposition

(i)]
pre-steps
α
:
B
→
A,
γ
:
B
→
C,
where
C
is
Frobenius-trivial.
Thus,
for
d
∈
N≥1
,
there
exists
a
base-identity
endomorphism
of
Frobenius
type
φC
∈
EndC
(C)
such
that
degFr
(φC
)
=
d;
by
assertion
(ii)
[cf.
also
Proposition
1.4,
(i)],
we
may
write
φC
◦
γ
=
γ

◦
ψ,
where
ψ
:
B
→
B

is
a
morphism
of
Frobenius
type,
and
γ

:
B

→
C
is
a
co-angular
pre-step.
Moreover,
the
portion
of
assertion
(ii)
concerning
the
relationship
between
Div(γ),
Div(γ

)
implies,
in
light
of
the
second
equivalence
of
categories
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d),
that
γ

factors
through
γ,
i.e.,
there
exists
a
co-angular
pre-step
β
:
B

→
B
such
that
def
γ
◦
β
=
γ

.
Thus,
if
we
set
φB
=
β
◦
ψ
∈
EndC
(B),
then
γ
◦
φB
=
φC
◦
γ.
Moreover,
since
φC
is
a
base-identity
endomorphism
of
Frobenius
degree
d,
and
γ
is
a
prestep,
it
follows
[cf.
Remark
1.1.1]
that
φB
is
also
a
base-identity
endomorphism
of
Frobenius
degree
d.
Thus,
we
conclude
that
B
is
quasi-Frobenius-trivial,
hence
that
A
is
sub-quasi-Frobenius-trivial,
as
desired.
If,
moreover,
A
is
group-like,
then
[since
C
istr
is
a
Frobenioid
—
cf.
Proposition
1.9,
(v)]
it
follows
from
Deﬁnition
1.3,

(b),
that

A

where
A
is
Frobenius-trivial.
But
by
Proposition
1.4,
(iii),
these
presteps
are
isomorphisms,
so
A
is
Frobenius-trivial,
as
desired.
This
completes
the

The

are
“functorial”
in
the
following
sense:
If
φ

is
an
arbitrary
morphism
of
C

,
α
:
C

A
and
β
:

(respectively,

are

such
that
(α∗

(Div(α))
=
φ∗
{(β

(respectively,
Div(α)
=

then
there
exists
a
unique
morphism
ψ
:
C

D
in
C
lin
such
that
β
◦
ψ
=
φ
◦
α
(respectively,
ψ
◦

=
β
◦
φ).
Moreover,
φ
is
a
pull-back
morphism
if
and
only
if
ψ
is.

A
pull-back

φ

(respectively,
ﬁberwise-surjective

if
and
only
if
Base(φ)
∈
Arr(D)
is.
(vii)
Let
φ
:
A
→
B
be
a
co-angular
pre-step;
:
C
→
B
a
morphism.
Then
there
exists
a
co-angular
pre-step
γ
:
D
→
C
and
a
morphism
α
:
D
→
A
such
that
◦
γ
=
φ
◦
α.
In
particular,
every
co-angular
pre-step
of
C
is
an
FSM-morphism.
def
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
Let
A,
B
∈
Ob(C);
AD
=
Base(A);
def
B
=
Base(B);
φD
:
AD
→
BD
a
morphism
in
D.
By
the
equivalence
of
categories
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(i),
(c),
it
follows
that
there
exists
a
pull-back
morphism
ψ
:
C
→
B
def
of
C
such
that
ψD
=
Base(ψ)
:
CD
→
BD
of
D
deﬁnes
an
object
of
DBD
that
is
isomorphic
to
the
object
deﬁned
by
φD
.
In
particular,
CD
is
isomorphic
to
AD
.
Since
C
is
of
base-trivial
type,
it
thus
follows
that
A,
C
are
isomorphic,
so
we
may
assume
that
A
=
C.
Thus,
ψ
projects
to
a
morphism
ψD
:
AD
→
BD
of
D
such
that
φD
=
ψD
◦
δ,
for
some
δ
∈
AutD
(AD
).
Since
C
is
of
Aut-ample
type,
it
thus
follows
that
δ
lifts
to
a
γ
∈
AutC
(A).
Thus,
taking
ψ
◦
γ
:
A
→
B
yields
a
morphism
of
C
that
projects
to
φD
.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
def
def
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
Let
A,
B
∈
Ob(C);
AD
=
Base(A);
BD
=
Base(B);
φ,
ψ
:
A
→
B
pull-back
morphisms
of
C
that
project
to
the
same
morphism
AD
→
BD
of
D.
By
the
deﬁnition
of
a
“pull-back
morphism”
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.2,
(ii)],
it
thus
follows
formally
that
there
exist
base-identity
endomorphisms
α,
β
∈
EndC
(A)
such
that
ψ
=
φ
◦
α,
φ
=
ψ
◦
β.
In
particular,
we
obtain
that
ψ
=
ψ
◦
β
◦
α,
φ
=
φ
◦
α
◦
β,
hence
[again
by
Deﬁnition
1.2,
(ii)]
that
α
◦
β,
β
◦
α
are
both
equal
to
the
identity
endomorphism
of
A,
i.e.,
that
α,
β
∈
AutC
(A).
But
this
implies
that
α,
β
∈
O×
(A)
=
{1},
so
φ
=
ψ,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
The
existence
and
uniqueness
of
β
as
asserted
follows
immediately
from
the
isomorphism
of
functors
appearing
in
the
deﬁnition
of
a
“pull-back
morphism”
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.2,
(ii)].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii).
Now
since
a
co-angular
linear
morphism
factors
as
the
composite
of
a
pull-back
morphism
with
a
co-angular
pre-step
[cf.
Propositions
1.4,
(iv);
1.7,
(iii)],
the
existence
of
the
map
“→”
of
assertion
(iv)
follows
immediately
[cf.
Proposition
1.7,
(iii)]
from
assertion
(iii)
and
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(c);
the
asserted
injectivity
of
this
map
follows
from
the
total
epimorphicity
of
C;
the
fact
that
this
map
is
uniquely
determined
by
the
condition
given
in
assertion
(iii)
follows
from
the
fact
that
pre-steps
are
monomorphisms
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(v),
(a)],
and
the
deﬁnition
of
a
“pull-back
morphism”
in
Deﬁnition
1.2,
(ii).

Next,
we
consider
assertion
(v).
First,
we
observe
that
the
uniqueness
of
ψ
follows
from
the
fact
that
β
is
a
monomorphism
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(v),
(a)]
in
the
non-resp’d
case
and
from
the
total
epimorphicity
of
C
applied
to
α
in
the
resp’d
case.
When
φ
is
a
pull-back
morphism
[hence
co-angular
and
linear
—
cf.
Proposition
1.4,
(ii)],
the
existence
of
a
pull-back
morphism
ψ
as
desired
follows
immediately
by
applying
the
equivalence
of
categories
induced
by
the
projection
functor
in
Definition
1.3,
(i),
(c);
the
deﬁnition
of
a
“pull-back
morphism”
in
Deﬁnition
1.2,
(ii);
Proposition
1.7,
(i),
(v)
[applied
to
co-angular
linear
morphisms];
and
the
equivalences
of
categories
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d).
When
φ
is
an
isometric
pre-step,
the
existence
of
an
isometric
pre-step
ψ
as
desired
follows
immediately
from
the
equivalence
of
categories
of
Proposition
1.9,
(ii)
[in
the
“case
of
a
co-angular
pre-step”].
When
φ
is
a
co-angular
pre-step,
the
existence
of
a
co-angular
pre-step
ψ
as
desired
follows
formally
from
the
equivalences
of
categories
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d).
In
light
of
the
factorizations
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(v),
(b),
(c);
Proposition
1.7,
(iii),
this
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(v).
Next,
we
observe
that
assertion
(vi)
follows
formally
from
the
isomorphism
of
functors
appearing
in
the
deﬁnition
of
a
“pull-back
morphism”
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.2,
(ii)],
together
with
the
equivalence
of
categories
induced
by
the
projection
functor
in
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(i),
(c)
[cf.
also
Proposition
1.7,
(v),
for
pull-back
morphisms].
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(vii).
By
applying
the
factorizations
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iv),
(a);
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(v),
(b),
it
follows
immediately
that
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
[from
the
point
of
view
of
showing
the
existence
of
γ,
α
with
the
desired
properties]
that
is
a
pull-back
morphism,
an
isometric
prestep,
a
co-angular
pre-step,
or
a
morphism
of
Frobenius
type.
If
is
a
pull-back
morphism,
then
it
follows
immediately
[by
“pulling
back
the
zero
divisor
of
φ
via
”
—
cf.
assertion
(v)]
that
there
exist
a
pull-back
morphism
α
:
D
→
A
and
a
co-angular
pre-step
γ
:
D
→
C
such
that
◦
γ
=
φ
◦
α.
Next,
observe
that
if
is
an
isometric
pre-step,
then
the
existence
of
γ,
α
with
the
desired
properties
follows
formally
from
the
equivalence
of
categories
of
Proposition
1.9,
(ii)
[induced
by
φ].
Next,
observe
that
if
is
a
co-angular
pre-step,
then
it
follows
immediately
from
the
second
equivalence
of
categories
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d),
that
there
exist
co-angular
pre-steps
α
:
D
→
A,
γ
:
D
→
C
such
that
◦
γ
=
φ
◦
α.
Finally,
we
consider
the
case
where
is
a
morphism
of
Frobenius
type.
By
applying
the
second
equivalence
of
categories
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d),
it
follows
that
we
may
assume
[by
replacing
φ
by
the
composite
of
φ
with
an
appropriate
pre-step
A
→
A]
that
Div(φ)
=
degFr
(
)
·
x,
for
some
x
∈
Φ(A).
Thus,
[by
applying
again
the
second
equivalence
of
categories
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d)],
it
follows
that
there
exist
a
morphism
of
Frobenius
type
α
:
D
→
A
and
a
co-angular
pre-step
γ
:
D
→
C
such
that
◦
γ
=
φ
◦
α
[cf.
also
Proposition
1.10,
(i)].
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
existence
of
γ,
α
with
the
desired
properties.
It
thus
follows
formally
that
every
co-angular
pre-step
of
C
is
ﬁberwise
surjective.
On
the
other
hand,
by
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(v),
(a),
every
pre-step
is
a
monomorphism.
Thus,
we
conclude
that
every
coangular
pre-step
of
C
is
an
FSM-morphism.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(vii).

[Indeed,
then
β

co-angular

it

[cf.

of

of

(Rigidity

Let

be
a
divisorial

a
connected,
totally
epimorphic
category
D;
C
→
FΦ
a
Frobenioid;
A
∈

further
that

[cf.

Then:

The

of
the
natural
functor
CA

C
with
the

functor

is
rigid
[cf.

In
particular,
the
functor
C

is
rigid.

The
composite

of
the

is

In
particular,
the
functor
C

is
rigid.
(iii)
Suppose,
moreover,
that
every
object
A
∈
Ob(C)
satisﬁes
[at
least]
one
of
the
following
two
conditions:
(a)
O×
(A)imtr-pre
=
{1}
[cf.
Proposition
1.9,
(ii)];

(b)
n∈N≥1
{O×
(A)}n
=
{1},
and,
moreover,
there
exists
a
co-angular
pre-step
∼
B
→
A
[which,
by
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(c),
induces
a
bijection
O×
(B)
→
O×
(A)]
such
that
B
is
quasi-Frobenius-trivial
and
Frobenius-normalized.
Then
the
category
C
is
slim.
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
Any
automorphism
α
of
the
functor
CA
→
pl-bk
→
CA
→
D.
On
D
determines
an
automorphism
of
the
composite
functor
CA
pl-bk
→
DAD
→
D,
the
other
hand,
this
composite
functor
factors
as
a
composite
CA
pl-bk
where
the
ﬁrst
functor
CA
→
DAD
is
[by
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(i),
(c)]
an
equivalence
of
categories.
Thus,
we
conclude
that
α
determines
an
automorphism
of
the
natural
functor
DAD
→
D,
which
is
necessarily
trivial,
since
D
is
slim.
Since
A
is
arbitrary,
we
thus
conclude
that
both
CA
→
D
and
C
→
D
are
rigid.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
Let
α
be
an
automorphism
of
the
functor
CA
→
FΦ
.
By
assertion
(i),
it
follows
that
the
automorphisms
of
objects
of
FΦ
[which,
by
Proposition
1.5,
(i),
is
itself
a
Frobenioid]
induced
by
α
are
base-identity
automorphisms.
Since
Φ
is
divisorial,
hence,
in
particular,
sharp
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(i),
(ii)],
it
thus
follows
that
all
of
these
automorphisms
are
trivial,
hence
that
α
is
trivial.
Since
A
is
arbitrary,
we
thus
conclude
that
both
CA
→
FΦ
and
C
→
FΦ
are
rigid.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
Let
α
be
an
automorphism
of
the
natural
functor
CA
→
C.
By
assertion
(i),
it
follows
that
the
automorphisms
of
objects
of
C
induced
by
α
are
base-identity
automorphisms,
i.e.,
belong
to
“O×
(−)”.
Moreover,
the
functoriality
of
the
automorphisms
induced
by
α
with
respect
to
isometric
presteps
implies
that
these
automorphisms
belong
to
“O×
(−)imtr-pre
”.
Similarly,
the
functoriality
of
the
automorphisms
induced
by
α
with
respect
to
base-identity
endomorphisms
implies
that,
at
least
in
the
case
of
quasi-Frobenius-trivial,
Frobeniusnormalized
objects
—
hence
also
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(c)]
objects
as
in
(b)
of
the

statement
of
assertion
(iii)
—
these
automorphisms
belong
to
“
n∈N≥1
{O×
(−)}n
”.
Thus,
we
conclude
that
under
either
of
the
assumptions
(a),
(b)
in
the
statement
of
assertion
(iii),
the
automorphisms
induced
by
α
are
trivial.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii).

that
if

of

to
hold,
then
it

not

case
that

by
assigning

One
key
result
for
analyzing
the
category-theoretic
structure
of
Frobenioids
[cf.
§3]
is
the
following:
Proposition
1.14.
(Irreducible
Morphisms)
Let
Φ
be
a
divisorial
monoid
on
a
connected,
totally
epimorphic
category
D;
C
→
FΦ
a
Frobenioid
of
isotropic
type;
φ
∈
Arr(C).
Suppose
further
that
D
is
of
FSMFF-type
[cf.
§0].
Then:
(i)
φ
is
irreducible
if
and
only
if
φ
is
one
of
the
following:
(a)
a
primeFrobenius
morphism;
(b)
a
step
such
that
Div(φ)
is
irreducible;
(c)
a
pull-back
morphism
such
that
Base(φ)
is
an
irreducible
morphism
of
D.
(ii)
φ
is
a
pre-step
if
and
only
if
it
is
an
FSM-morphism
that
is
midadjoint
[cf.
§0]
to
the
irreducible
morphisms
which
are
not
pre-steps.
(iii)
Suppose
that
φ
is
irreducible.
Then
φ
is
a
non-pre-step
if
and
only
if
the
following
condition
holds:
There
exists
an
N
∈
N≥1
such
that
for
every
equality
of
composites
in
C
αn
◦
αn−1
◦

◦
α2
◦
α1
=
ψ
◦
φ
—
where
α1
,
.
.
.
,
αn
,
ψ
are
FSMI-morphisms
[cf.
§0]
—
it
holds
that
n
≤
N
.
(iv)
Let
α
◦
β
=
β

◦
α
be
an
equality
of
composites
of
C,
where
degFr
(β)
=
degFr
(β

),
and
α,
α
are
irreducible.
Then
α
is
a
prime-Frobenius
morphism
if
and
only
if
α
is;
moreover,
degFr
(α)
=
degFr
(α
).
(v)
Suppose
further
that
Φ
is
non-dilating,
and
that
φ
is
a
non-pre-step
irreducible
endomorphism
of
a
non-group-like
object
A
∈
Ob(C).
Then
φ
is
a
Div-identity
prime-Frobenius
endomorphism
if
and
only
if
the
following
condition
holds:
For
every
step
α
:
A
→
B,
there
exists
a
non-pre-step
irreducible
morphism
ψ
:
B
→
B

and
a
step
β
:
B
→
B

such
that
ψ
◦
α
=
β
◦
α
◦
φ.
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
The
suﬃciency
of
the
condition
of
assertion
(i)
follows
for
morphisms
as
in
(a)
(respectively,
(b);
(c))
from
Proposition
1.10,
(iv)
(respectively,
the
equivalences
of
categories
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d)
[cf.
also
Propositions
1.4,

To
verify
the
necessity
of
the
condition
of
assertion
(i),
observe
that
it
follows
formally
from
the
factorization
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iv),
(a),
that
φ
is
either
a
morphism
of
Frobenius
type,
a
step,
or
a
pull-back
morphism.
Thus,
by
Propositions
1.7,
(v);
1.10,
(iv);
1.11,
(vi),
the
irreducibility
of
φ
implies
immediately
that
φ
is
a
morphism
as
in
(a),
(b),
or
(c).
42
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
To
verify
the
suﬃciency
of
the
condition
of
assertion
(ii),
observe
ﬁrst
that
by
the
factorization
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iv),
(a),
we
may
write
φ
=
α
◦
β
◦
γ,
where
α
is
a
pull-back
morphism,
β
is
a
pre-step,
and
γ
is
a
morphism
of
Frobenius
type.
By
assertion
(i)
[cf.
also
Proposition
1.10,
(v)],
it
follows
that
γ
is
an
isomorphism;
thus,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
γ
is
the
identity,
i.e.,
φ
=
α
◦
β.
On
the
other
hand,
it
follows
formally
from
the
fact
that
φ
is
an
FSM-morphism
that
α
is
ﬁberwise-surjective
[cf.
§0].
Next,
I
claim
that
α
is
a
monomorphism.
Indeed,
write
φ
:
A
→
B,
β
:
A
→
C,
α
:
C
→
B;
let
1
,
2
:
D
→
C
be
such
that
α
◦
1
=
α
◦
2
.
Then
by
Remark
1.1.1,
it
follows
immediately
that
degFr
(
1
)
=
degFr
(
2
),
Div(
1
)
=
Div(
2
),
hence,
by
applying
the
factorization
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iv),
(a)
[and
the
total
epimorphicity
of
C;
cf.
also
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(ii),
and
the
equivalences
of
categories
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d)],
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
[from
the
point
of
view
of
showing
that
α
is
a
monomorphism]
that
1
,
2
are
pull-back
morphisms.
Now
by
“adding
the
pull-backs
of
β∗
(Div(β))
via
1
,
2
”
[cf.
Proposition
1.11,
(v);
the
equivalences
of
categories
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d)],
it
follows
that
there
exists
a
pre-step
ζ
:
E
→
D
such
that
there
exist
γ1
,
γ2
∈
Arr(C)
satisfying
1
◦
ζ
=
β
◦
γ1
,
2
◦
ζ
=
β
◦
γ2
.
Thus,
we
have:
φ
◦
γ1
=
α
◦
β
◦
γ1
=
α
◦
1
◦
ζ
=
α
◦
2
◦
ζ
=
α
◦
β
◦
γ2
=
φ
◦
γ2
.
But
since
φ
is
[an
FSM-morphism,
hence,
in
particular]
a
monomorphism,
it
follows
that
γ1
=
γ2
,
hence
[by
the
total
epimorphicity
of
C]
that
1
=
2
.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
claim.
In
particular,
we
conclude
that
α
is
an
FSM-morphism.
Thus,
it
follows
[cf.
Proposition
1.11,
(vi)]
that
Base(α)
is
an
FSM-morphism
of
D.
Since,
however,
we
are
operating
under
the
assumption
that
D
is
of
FSMFFtype,
it
follows
that
if
α
is
not
an
isomorphism,
then
Base(α)
admits
a
subordinate
[cf.
condition
(a)
of
the
deﬁnition
of
a
“category
of
FSMFF-type”
in
§0]
FSMImorphism,
which
implies
[cf.
Proposition
1.11,
(vi)]
that
α
admits
a
subordinate
FSMI-morphism
[which
is
also
a
pull-back
morphism].
Since
φ,
however,
is
assumed
to
be
mid-adjoint
to
the
irreducible
morphisms
which
are
not
pre-steps,
we
thus
obtain
a
contradiction.
Thus,
α
is
an
isomorphism,
so
φ
is
a
pre-step.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
suﬃciency
of
the
condition
of
assertion
(ii).
Next,
we
consider
the
necessity
of
the
condition
of
assertion
(ii).
Thus,
suppose
that
φ
is
a
pre-step.
By
Proposition
1.11,
(vii),
φ
is
an
FSM-morphism;
by
Proposition
1.7,
(v),
φ
is
mid-adjoint
to
the
non-pre-steps.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
By
assertion
(i),
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
assertion
(iii)
holds
for
each
of
the
three
types
of
morphisms
“(a),
(b),
(c)”
discussed
in
assertion
(i).
If
φ
is
an
irreducible
pre-step,
then
it
follows
immediately
—
by
taking
ψ
to
be
a
prime-Frobenius
morphism
of
increasingly
large
Frobenius
degree
[cf.
Proposition
1.10,
(ii)]
—
that
the
condition
in
the
statement
of
assertion
(iii)
is
false
[as
desired].
On
the
other
hand,
if
φ
is
a
non-pre-step,
then
it
is
an
isometry.
Now
if
the
condition
in
the
statement
of
assertion
(iii)
is
false,
then
there
exist
equalities
αn
◦
αn−1
◦
.
.
.
◦
α2
◦
α1
=
ψ
◦
φ
where
α1
,
.
.
.
,
αn
,
ψ
are
FSMI-morphisms,
and
n
is
arbitrarily
large.
Here,
we
note
that
since
ψ
◦φ
and
ψ
are
FSM-morphisms,
it
thus
follows
formally
that
φ
is
also
an
FSM-morphism.
Next,
observe
that
since
φ
is
an
isometry,
it
follows
from
the
fact
THE
GEOMETRY
OF
FROBENIOIDS
I
43
that
ψ
is
irreducible
[cf.
also
assertion
(i);
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(ii),
(b);
Remark
1.1.1]
that
Div(ψ
◦
φ)
is
either
zero
or
irreducible;
since,
moreover,
degFr
(ψ
◦
φ)
always
divides
a
product
of
two
prime
numbers
[cf.
assertion
(i);
the
irreducibility
of
φ,
ψ],
it
thus
follows
that
in
any
factorization
of
ψ
◦
φ
by
FSMI-morphisms,
all
but
three
[i.e.,
corresponding
to
two
possible
prime
factors
of
the
Frobenius
degree,
plus
one
possible
irreducible
factor
of
the
zero
divisor]
of
the
factorizing
FSMI-morphisms
are
pull-back
morphisms
[cf.
assertion
(i)].
On
the
other
hand,
this
implies
that
factorizations
of
arbitrarily
large
length
determine
chains
of
FSMI-morphisms
[cf.
assertion
(i);
Proposition
1.11,
(vi)]
originating
from
the
projection
to
D
of
the
domain
of
φ
which
are
also
of
arbitrarily
large
length,
a
contradiction
[cf.
condition
(b)
of
the
deﬁnition
of
a
“category
of
FSMFF-type”
in
§0].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iv).
Since
degFr
(β)
=
degFr
(β

),
it
follows
from
Remark
1.1.1
that
degFr
(α)
=
degFr
(α
),
hence
[since
α,
α
are
irreducible],
by
assertion
(i),
that
α
is
a
prime-Frobenius
morphism
if
and
only
if
α
is.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iv).
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(v).
First,
we
observe
that
the
necessity
of
the
condition
in
the
statement
of
assertion
(v)
[where
we
take
ψ
to
be
a
prime-Frobenius
morphism
such
that
degFr
(φ)
=
degFr
(ψ)]
follows
immediately
from
Proposition
1.10,
(i)
[cf.
also
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(ii);
assertion
(i);
the
ﬁrst
equivalence
of
categories
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d)].
Next,
we
consider
suﬃciency.
To
show
that
φ
is
a
prime-Frobenius
morphism,
it
suﬃces
[by
assertion
(i)]
to
show
that
it
is
not
a
pull-back
morphism.
Thus,
suppose
that
φ
is
a
pull-back
morphism.
Since
A
is
nongroup-like,
it
follows
[cf.
Proposition
1.4,
(iii)]
that
there
exists
a
step
α
:
A
→
B,
hence
that
there
exist
ψ,
β
as
in
the
statement
of
assertion
(v).
By
assertions
(i),
def
def
(iv),
ψ
is
also
a
pull-back
morphism.
Write

Div(α),
y
=
α∗
(Div(β))
[where,
for
simplicity,
we
write
α∗
for
Φ(Base(α))].
Then
by
Remark
1.1.1,
it
follows
that
φ∗
(x
+
y)
=
x,
i.e.,
that
φ∗
(x)
≤
x.
Since
x
=
0
is
arbitrary
[cf.
the
ﬁrst
equivalence
of
categories
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d)],
it
thus
follows
from
our
assumption
that
Φ
is
non-dilating
that
φ∗
is
the
identity
morphism.
But
this
implies
that
x
+
y
=
x,
i.e.,
[since
Φ
is
integral
—
cf.
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(i)]
that
y
=
0,
in
contradiction
to
our
assumption
that
β
is
a
step
[i.e.,
not
just
a
[necessarily
co-angular!]
pre-step
—
cf.
Proposition
1.4,
(i),
(iii)].
Thus,
we
conclude
[cf.
assertion
(iv)]
that
φ,
ψ
are
prime-Frobenius
morphisms,
of
the
same
Frobenius
degree.
In
particular,
if
def
def
we
write
x
=
Div(α),
y
=
α∗
(Div(β)),
then
it
follows
[cf.
Remark
1.1.1]
that
φ∗
(x
+
y)
=
degFr
(φ)
·
x,
i.e.,
that
φ∗
(x)

x
[cf.
§0],
hence
[by
our
assumption
that
Φ
is
non-dilating]
that
φ∗
is
the
identity
morphism.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(v).

Frobenius
Functors
In

discuss
various
functors
between
Frobenioids
that
are
intended
to
be
reminiscent
of
the
Frobenius
morphism
in
positive
characteristic
scheme
theory.
In
the
following
discussion,
we
maintain
the
notation
of
§1.
Also,
we
assume
that
we
have
been
given
a
divisorial
monoid
Φ
on
a
connected,
totally
epimorphic
category
D
and
a
Frobenioid

such
that
φ

[cf.
Proposition

—
determines
a
functor
Ψ:C→C
[well-deﬁned
up
to
isomorphism
of
functors]
which
we
shall
refer
to
as
the
naive
Frobenius
functor
[of
degree
d]
on
C.
Finally,
the
composite
of
the
naive
Frobenius
functor
of
degree
d1
∈
N≥1
on
C
with
the
naive
Frobenius
functor

d2

N≥1
on
C
is
isomorphic
to
the
naive
Frobenius
functor
of

d1
·
d2
on

(ii)
The
functor
Ψ
of
(i)
is
“1-compatible”,
relative
to
C

,
with
the
functor
FΦ
→
FΦ
—
which
we
shall
refer
to
as
the
Frobenius
functor
on

—
determined
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(iii)]
by
the
endomorphism
of
the
functor
Φ
given
by
multiplication
by
d.
Moreover,
if,
in
the
notation
of
(i),
A
=
A
,
A
is
Frobenius-normalized,
and
the
morphism
α
:
A
→
A
is
taken
to
be
a
baseidentity
endomorphism,
then
the
morphism
of
monoids
O
(A)
→
O
(A
)
induced
by
Ψ
is
given
by
raising
to
the
d-th
power.
(iii)
C
is
of
perfect
type
if
and
only
if
Ψ
is
an
equivalence
of
categories.
Proof.
Assertions
(i),
(ii)
follow
immediately
from
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(ii);
Proposition
1.10,
(i)
[cf.
also
Proposition
1.7,
(i)].
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
The
suﬃciency
of
the
condition
of
assertion
(iii)
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
“perfect”
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.2,
(iv);
Remark
1.1.1].
To
verify
necessity,
suppose
that
C
is
of
perfect
type.
Then
the
essential
surjectivity
of
Ψ
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
“perfect”
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.2,
(iv)].
To
verify
that
Ψ
is
fully
faithful,
we
reason
as
follows:
In
light
of
the
1-compatibility
of
Ψ
with
the
Frobenius
functor
on
FΦ
[cf.
assertion
(ii)],
the
total
epimorphicity
of
C,
and
the
factorization
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iv),
(a),
it
follows
immediately
that
one
may
reduce
to
the
case
of
linear
morphisms
by
applying
the
existence
and
(essential)
uniqueness
of
morphisms
of
Frobenius
type
of
a
given
Frobenius
degree
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,

in

one
may
reduce
further
to
the
case
of

But
the
case
of
pre-steps
follows
immediately
from

This

Remark
2.1.1.
If

then
for
any

,
where
a,

composing
the
naive
Frobenius
functor
of
degree
a
with
some
quasiinverse
functor
to
the
naive
Frobenius

of

b
yields
a
“naive
Frobenius

of
degree
d”,
which,
by
Proposition
2.1,
(i),
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
a,

Proposition
2.2.
(The

Write

then
O
(φD∗

the

then
O

the

shall
also
denote
by
“O

the
restriction
of
this
functor
on

Finally,
by

the

we
obtain
a

by

we

(iii)
The

Moreover,
the

SHINICHI

Proof.
As
for
assertion
(i),
essential
surjectivity
follows
immediately
from
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(i),
(a)
[i.e.,
applied
to
the
Frobenioid
C
istr
—
cf.
Proposition
1.9,
(v)],
while
fully
faithfulness
follows
formally
from
the
deﬁnition
of
the
category
D
∗
.
Next,
def
def
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
Let
A,
B
∈
Ob(C
istr
);
AD
=
Base(A);
BD
=
Base(B).
Now
observe
that
any
morphism
AD
→
BD
in
D
factors
as
the
composite
of
an
∼
def
isomorphism
AD
→
CD
,
where
C
∈
Ob(C
istr
),
CD
=
Base(C),
with
a
morphism
CD
→
BD
which
is
the
projection
to
D
of
a
pull-back
morphism
C
→
B
of
C
istr
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(i),
(c)];
moreover,
this
pull-back
morphism
is
uniquely
determined,
istr
as
an
object
of
CB
,
up
to
isomorphism
[cf.
the
isomorphism
of
functors
appearing
in
the
deﬁnition
of
a
“pull-back
morphism”
in
Deﬁnition
1.2,
(ii)].
Thus,
it
follows
that
to
construct
the
desired
functor
“O
(−)”
on
D
∗
,
it
suﬃces
to
construct,
for
∼
each
isomorphism
φD
:
AD

BD
,
a
bijection
O
(φD
)
:
O
(A)
→
O
(B)
which
is
compatible
with
composition
of
isomorphisms.
[Indeed,
once
one
constructs
“O
(−)”
in
this
fashion,
the
fact
that
this
“O
(−)”
is
compatible
with
composites
of
morphisms
of
D
∗
follows
immediately
from
the
manifest
functoriality
of
the
inclusion
of
Proposition
1.11,
(iv).]
This
may
be
done
by
using
co-angular
pre-steps
γA
:
C
→
A,
γB
:
C
→
B
such
that
φD
=
Base(γB
)
◦
Base(γA
)−1
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
∼

and
the
bijections
O
(γA

:
O

:
O

→
O
(C)
determined
by
γA
,
γB

Note,
moreover,
that
the

bijection
O
(γA

◦
O
(γB
)
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
γA

γB
.
[Indeed,
if
δA

D

A,
δB

D

satisfy
φD

◦

then

such
that
Base(γA

◦
Base(

—
which
[since
Base(δB

◦
Base(δA

]
implies
that
Base(γB

◦
Base(

=

◦
Base(

hence
that
O
(γA

=

O
(γB

)
=

that

is
a
Frobenioid].
Proof.
First,
we
observe
that,
by
applying
either
of
the
equivalences
of
categories
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d),
assertion
(i)
follows
formally
from
the
fact
that
C
is
of
metrically
trivial
and
Aut-ample
type.
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
Since
C
is
of
metrically
trivial
type,
it
follows
from
the
existence
of
[necessarily
co-angular
—
cf.
Proposition
1.4,
(i)]
pre-steps
relating
base-isomorphic
objects
of
C
istr
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(i),
(b)],
that
the
isomorphism
class
of
an
object
of
C
istr
is
completely
determined
by
the
isomorphism
class
of
D
to
which
it
projects.
In
particular,
it
follows
from
the
existence
of
Frobenius-trivial
objects
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(i),
(a)]
that
every
object
of
C
istr
is
Frobenius-trivial.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
By
applying
the
factorizations
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iv),
(a);
(v),
(c),
together
with
the
bijection
of
assertion
(i)
[cf.
also
the
equivalences
of
categories
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d)],
we
conclude
that
every
morphism
φ
of
C
admits
a
factorization
φ=α◦β◦γ◦δ
in
C,
where
α
is
a
pull-back
morphism;
β
is
a
base-identity
pre-step
endomorphism
[hence
is
co-angular,
by
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(b)];
γ
is
an
isometric
pre-step;
δ
is
a
morphism
of
Frobenius
type.
Moreover,
this
factorization
is
unique
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iv),
(a);
(v),
(c)],
up
to
replacing
(α,
β,
γ,
δ)
by
(α◦
,
−1
◦β◦ζ,
ζ
−1
◦γ◦θ,
θ
−1
◦δ),
where
,
θ
are
isomorphisms
of
C,
and
ζ
=
β

◦
,
for
some
base-identity
automorphism
β

.
Suppose
that
β
∈
O
(A),
for
A
∈
Ob(C).
Thus,
by
applying
the
characteristic
splitting
∼
O×
(A)
×
τ
(A)
→
O
(A)
[which
applies
even
if
A
is
not
isotropic
—
cf.
Deﬁnition
2.3,
(a),
(b)]
to
β
∈
O
(A),
we
obtain
a
factorization
β
=
β0
·
β1
[where
β0
∈
O×
(A),
β1
∈
τ
(A)].
Now
we
set
def
Ψ(β)
=
β0
·
β1d
;
def
Ψ(φ)
=
α
◦
Ψ(β)
◦
γ

[where
we
note
that
the
expression
“β1d
”
makes
sense
for
d
∈
Λ>0
,
by
assertion
(i);
Deﬁnition
2.4,
(ii)].
Then
it
follows
immediately
from
the
functoriality
of
the
∼
characteristic
splitting
τ
(−)
that
for
any
isomorphism
:
A

in
C,
β

we
have
Ψ(
−1
◦
β
◦
β

◦
)
=
−1
◦
Ψ(β)
◦
β

◦

This
implies
immediately
that
Ψ(φ)
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
factorization
φ
=
α
◦
β
◦
γ
◦
δ.
Next,
observe
that
by
assertion
(ii),
it
follows
that
if
φ
∈
Arr(C
istr
),
then
the
morphism
of
Frobenius
type
δ
may
be
taken
to
be
a
base-identity
endomorphism.
Thus,
by
the
functoriality
of
τ
with
respect
to
morphisms
of
(C

)lin
,
and
our
assumption
that
C

=

for
d
∈
N≥1
—
it
follows
that
the
assignment
φ
→
Ψ(φ)
is
compatible
with
composites,
at
least
when
φ
∈
Arr(C
istr
).
On
the
other
hand,
since
isotropic
hulls
are
monomorphisms
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(v),
(a)],
this
implies
[by
relating
an
arbitrary
φ
∈
Arr(C)
to
the
result
of
applying
the
isotropiﬁcation
functor
of
Proposition
1.9,
(v),
to
φ]
that
the
assignment
φ
→
Ψ(φ)
is
compatible
with
composites,
for
arbitrary
φ
∈
Arr(C).
This
completes
the
deﬁnition
of
a
functor

C
→
C
(d)
which
satisﬁes
the
properties
(a),
(b)
in
the
statement
of

On

other
hand,
it
is
clear
from
the
deﬁnition
of
Ψ,
C
(d)
that
Ψ
is
essentially
surjective,

full
[cf.

If

If

then

Proof.
First,
let
us
observe
that
the
naive
Frobenius
functor
C
→
C
associated
to
d
[cf.
Proposition
2.1,
(i)]
factors
naturally
through
the

write

for
the
resulting

Next,
let
us
write
Ψ2
:
C
(d)
→

for
some
quasi-inverse
functor
to
the
unit-linear
Frobenius
functor
[which
is
an

associated
def
to

[cf.
Proposition
2.5,
(iii)].
Set
Ψ
=
Ψ2
◦
Ψ1
:
C
→
C.
Then
it
follows
immediately
from
Propositions
2.1,
(ii);
2.5,
(iii),
(b),
that
Ψ
satisﬁes
property
(a).
Since
[cf.
Proposition
2.5,
(ii)]
the
isomorphism
class
of
an
object
of
C
istr
is
completely
determined
by
the
isomorphism
class
of

to

it
thus
follows
that
Ψ
preserves

Now

Remark

The

Suppose

that

Proposition
2.9.
(Unit-wise
Frobenius
Functors

Suppose
that
the

C
is
of
Frobenius-normalized,
base-trivial,
isotropic,
and
Autample
[cf.
Remark

type.
Then:
(i)
If
the
base
category
D
admits
a
terminal
object
[cf.
§0],
then
C
is
of
pre-model
type.
(ii)
Let
τ
be
a
characteristic
splitting
on
C;
ζ
:
Primes
→
N≥1
a
set-theoretic
function.
Suppose
that
C
is
of
pre-model
and
unit-proﬁnite
type.
Then
there
exists
a
functor
Ψ:C→C
—
which
we
shall
refer
to
as
the
unit-wise
Frobenius
functor
[associated
to
τ
,
ζ]
—
which
satisﬁes
the
following
properties:
(a)
Ψ
is
1-compatible,
relative
to
the
functor
C
→
FΦ
,
with
the
identity
functor
on
FΦ
.
(b)
Ψ
maps
an
object
(respectively,
morphism
of
Frobenius
type;
pre-step;
pull-back
morphism)
of
C
to
an
isomorphic
object
(respectively,
abstractly
equivalent
morphism;
abstractly
equivalent
morphism;
abstractly
equivalent
morphism)
of
C.
(c)
If
A
∈
Ob(C),
then
there
exists
an
isomorphism
Ψ(A)
∼
=
A
such
that
the
endomorphism
of
O×
(A)
induced
by
Ψ
followed
by
conjugation
by
this
isomorphism
is
given
by
raising
to
the
ζ-th
power.
(d)
If
ζ
is
of
co-prime
type
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.8,
(iii)],
then
Ψ
is
an
equivalence
of
categories.
If
C
is
of
unit-trivial
type,
then
Ψ
is
isomorphic
to
the
identity
functor.
Proof.
By
well-known
general
nonsense
in
category
theory,
we
may
assume,
without
loss
of
generality,
for
the
remainder
of
the
proof
of
Proposition
2.9,
that
the
category
C
is
a
skeleton.
Thus,
C
pl-bk
is
also
a
skeleton.
Now
we
consider
assertion
(i).
Observe
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(i),
(c);
the
fact
that
C
is
of
base-trivial
type]
that
if
A
∈
Ob(C)
projects
to
a
terminal
object
of
D,
then
A
is
pseudo-terminal
[cf.
§0].
Note
that
by
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(i),
(a),
and
our
assumptions
on
D,
it
follows
that
such
an
object
A
always
exists;
let
us
ﬁx
one
such
object
A.
Thus,
the
natural
projection
functor
determines
an
equivalence
of
categories
∼
pl-bk
CA
→D
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(i),
(c)].
Note
that
it
follows
immediately
from
the
existence
of
this
equivalence
of
categories
[together
with
the
fact
that
A
maps
to
a
terminal
54
SHINICHI

pl-bk
object
of
D]
that
the
natural
functor
CA
→
C
pl-bk
is
injective
on
isomorphism
pl-bk
is
a
skeletal
subcategory
[cf.
§0],
then
classes
of
objects.
In
particular,
if
Q
⊆
CA
[relative
to
some
suﬃciently
large
universe
with
respect
to
which,
say,
the
category
C
is
small]
the
natural
map
Ob(Q)
→
Ob(C
pl-bk
)
=
Ob(C)
∼
pl-bk
is
bijective
[cf.
the
fact
that
C
is
of
base-trivial
type;
the
equivalence
CA
→
D].
Thus,
the
subcategory
P
⊆
C
determined
by
the
image
of
the
objects
and
arrows
of
Q
in
C
is
a
skeleton
which
satisﬁes
the
conditions
of
Deﬁnition
2.7,
(i)
[cf.
the
fact
that
C
is
of
base-trivial
and
isotropic
type;
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(i),
(a)]
—
that
is
to
say,
P
is
a
base-section.
Next,
let
us
observe
[cf.
the
fact
that
C
is
of
base-trivial
and
isotropic
type;
Definition
1.3,
(i),
(a)]
that
A
is
Frobenius-trivial,
hence
that
there
exists
a
morphism
of
monoids
FA
:
N≥1
→
EndC
(A)
whose
composite
with
the
morphism
of
monoids
degFr
(−)
:
EndC
(A)
→
N≥1
is
the
identity
morphism
on
N≥1
,
and
whose
image
consists
of
base-identity
endomorphisms
of
Frobenius
type
of
A.
Thus,
by
Proposition
1.11,
(iii),
we
conclude
that
FA
extends
to
a
P-Frobenius-section
F
:
N≥1
→
End(P
→
C)
—
hence
that
C
is
of
pre-model
type,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
Observe
[cf.
the
fact
that
C
is
of
base-trivial
and
isotropic
type;
the
fact
that
C
is
a
skeleton]
we
may
apply
Remark
2.7.2
to
conclude
that
every
morphism
φ
:
C
→
D
of
C
admits
a
unique
factorization
φ=α◦β◦γ
in
C,
where
α
is
P-distinguished;
β
is
a
base-identity
pre-step
endomorphism;
γ
is
F
-distinguished.
Now
[cf.
the
proof
of
Proposition
2.5,
(iii)]
by
applying
the
∼
characteristic
splitting
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.3,
(a)]
O×
(C)
×
τ
(C)
→
O
(C),
we
may
write
β
=
β0
·
β1
∈
O
(C)
[where
β0
∈
O×
(C),
β1
∈
τ
(C)].
Set
def
Ψ(β)
=
β0ζ
·
β1
;
def
Ψ(φ)
=
α
◦
Ψ(β)
◦
γ
[where
“(−)ζ
”
is
as
deﬁned
in
Deﬁnition
2.8,
(iii)].
Since
β
is
completely
determined
by
φ,
it
follows
that
Ψ
is
well-deﬁned
[as
a
“map
on
arrows”].
Moreover,
it
follows
from
the
deﬁnition
of
P-
and
F
-distinguished
morphisms
[together
with
the
fact
that
raising
to
the
ζ-th
power
deﬁnes
an
endomorphism
of
the
functor
in
monoids
“O×
(−)”
on
C

which
commutes
with
raising

the
d-th

that

and
that
Ψ
satisﬁes
properties
(a),
(b),
(c),
(d)
in
the
statement
of
Proposition

(ii).
This
completes
the
proof
of
Proposition
2.9.

Remark
2.9.1.
By
“base-changing”
the
Frobenioid
C
via
various
functors
D

→
D
as
in
Proposition
1.6,
it
follows
that
one
may
obtain
“unit-wise
Frobenius
functors”
as
in
Proposition
2.9,
(ii),
for
many
Frobenioids
whose
base
categories
do
not
necessarily
admit
terminal
objects
[as
is
required
in
the
hypotheses
of
Proposition
2.9,
(i)].
Remark
2.9.2.
We
shall
see
later
[cf.
Theorem

that
in

the

in

Section
3:
Category-theoreticity
of
the
Base
and
Frobenius
Degree
In
the
present
§3,
we
show
various
results
in
the
“opposite
direction”
to
the
direction
represented
by
the
various
Frobenius
functors
of
§2.
Namely,
we
show
that
various
natural
structures
—
such
as
Frobenius
degrees
and
the
natural
projection
functor
to
the
base
category
—
are
preserved
by
equivalences
of
categories
between
Frobenioids.
In
the
following
discussion,
we
maintain
the
notation
of
§1,
§2.
Also,
we
assume
that
we
have
been
given
a
divisorial
monoid
Φ
on
a
connected,
totally
epimorphic
category
D
and
a
Frobenioid
C

FΦ
.
Deﬁnition
3.1.
(i)
We
shall
say
that
C

it
holds
that
A

Ob(C)
is
non-isotropic
if
and
only
if
it
is
an
iso-subanchor
[cf.
§0].
[Thus,
if
C
is
of
isotropic
type,
then
C
is
of
quasi-isotropic
type
—
cf.
Remark
3.1.1
below.]
We
shall
say
that
C
is
of
standard
type
if
the
following
conditions
are
satisﬁed:
(a)
C
is
of
quasi-isotropic
and
Frobenius-isotropic
type;
(b)
if
C
is
of
group-like
type,
then
C
istr
admits
a
Frobenius-compact
object;
(c)
C
is
of
Frobenius-normalized
type;
(d)
D
is
of
FSMFF-type;
(e)
Φ
is
non-dilating.
We
shall
say
that
a
category
E
is
Frobenius-slim
if
every
homomorphism
of
monoids
F

Aut(EA
→
E)
[where
A

factors
through
the

every
slim
category
is
Frobenius-slim.]

Write

The

one
veriﬁes
immediately
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,

that
this
set
of
morphisms
of
C
pf
from
(A,

to

is
independent
[up
to
uniquely

natural

of
the

of

A

A
,
B

B

;
composition
of
morphisms
of
C
pf
is
deﬁned
in
the
evident
fashion.
[Thus,
in
words,
the
pair
(A,
n)
is
to
be
thought
of
as
an
“n-th
root
of
A”.]
Also,
we
obtain
a
natural

C

mapping
“A

(iv)
Two
co-objective
[cf.
§0]
morphisms

α2
:
A

be

if
there
exist

δ

such
that
α1
=

γ,
α2
=
β
◦
δ
◦
γ.
In
this
situation,
O×
we
shall
write

[Thus,
if
C

of
unit-trivial
type,
then
two

and
only

they

By

an

relation
on
the
set
of

is,
moreover,

we

for
the
set
of

classes
of

Also,
we

the

Remark
3.1.1.
Observe
that:
An
iso-subanchor
of
the
Frobenioid
C
is
never
isotropic.
[In
particular,
if
C
is
of
isotropic
type,
then
C
is
of
quasi-isotropic
type.]
Indeed,
by
Proposition
1.10,
(iv),
an
anchor
is
never
isotropic.
Thus,
by
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(vii),
(b),
a
subanchor
is
never
isotropic.
Now
if
B
→
A
is
a
mono-minimal
categorical
quotient
[cf.
§0]
in
C
of
B
by
a
group
G
⊆
AutC
(B)
such
that
B
is
a
subanchor
and
A
is
isotropic,
then
applying
the
isotropiﬁcation
functor
of
Proposition
1.9,
(v),
yields
a
factorization
B

B


A,
where
B

is
an
isotropic
hull
[hence
a
monomorphism
—

such
that
G
acts
compatibly
[relative
to
the
arrow
B

B

]
on
B

;
thus,
by
the
deﬁnition
of
the
term
“mono-minimal”
it
follows
that
the
arrow
B
→
B

is
an
isomorphism,
i.e.,
that
B
is
isotropic
—
a
contradiction.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
“observation”.

SHINICHI

Remark
3.1.2.
Observe
that
for
any
residually
ﬁnite
group
G
[i.e.,
a
group
G
such
that
the
intersection
of
the
normal
subgroups
of
ﬁnite
index
of
G
is
trivial]:
Any
homomorphism
of
monoids
F
→
G
factors
through
the
natural
surjection
F

N≥1
.
[Indeed,
it
suﬃces
to
show
this
when
G
is
ﬁnite.
When
G
is
ﬁnite,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
F
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(iii)]
that
the
image
of
1
∈
Z≥0
in
G
is
an
element
γ
∈
G
such
that
for
every
d
∈
N≥1
,
there
exists
an
element
δd
∈
G
such
that
δd
·γ
·δd−1
=
γ
d
.
Thus,
by
taking
d
to
be
the
order
of
γ,
we
conclude
that
γ
is
the
identity,
hence
that
the
homomorphism
of
monoids
F
→
G
factors
through
the
natural
surjection
F

N≥1
,
as
desired.]
In
particular,
it
follows
that
if
E
is
a
category
such
that
for
every
A
∈
Ob(E),
the
group
Aut(EA
→
E)
is
residually
ﬁnite,
then
E
is
Frobenius-slim.
Remark
3.1.3.
The
phenomenon
discussed
in
Remark
3.1.2
may
be
regarded
as
an
example
of
the
following
fundamental
dichotomy
[which
is,
in
a
certain
sense,
a
central
theme
of
the
theory
of
the
present
paper]
between
the
structure
of
the
base
category
D
and
the
“Frobenius
structure”
constituted
by
N≥1
:
base
category
“indiﬀerent
to
order”
groups
Frobenius
“order-conscious”
non-group-like
monoids
This
sort
of
phenomenon
may
be
observed
in
“classical
scheme
theory”
for
instance
in
the
invariance
of
the
étale
site
of
a
scheme
in
positive
characteristic
under
the
Frobenius
morphism.
Here,
it
is
useful
to
recall
that
a
typical
example
of
a
“base
category”
is
constituted
by
the
subcategory
of
connected
objects
of
a
Galois
category
[which
is
easily
veriﬁed
to
be
of
FSM-,
hence
also
of
FSMFF-type].
By
contrast,
categories
such
as
Order(Z≥0
),
Order(N≥1
)
or
[the
one-object
categories

Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion

Note
that
since
the

factors
as

it

follows
that
any

End(CA
a
homomorphism
of

F
→
Aut(DAD

D)
—
which,
if

is
Frobenius-slim
[cf.
Deﬁnition
3.1,

necessarily
factors
through


N≥1
—
together
with
a
homomorphism
of

F

obtained
by
considering
the
Frobenius
degree
of
the
induced
endomorphism
of
A
—
which
[in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
monoid

is
commutative,
together
with
the
structure
of

—
cf.
Deﬁnition

also
necessarily
factors
through

.
Thus,
we
conclude
that
if

is
Frobenius-slim,
then
the
image

of
1

⊆

all

as

The
“converse
assertion”
[when

may
be
veriﬁed

as
in
the
deﬁnition
of
the
term
“Frobenius-trivial”
[cf.
the
homomorphism
“ζ”
of
Deﬁnition
1.2,

which,
together
with
the
homomorphism
of

Z≥0
→
EndC
(A)
that
maps
1
∈
Z≥0
to
a
given
base-identity
pre-step
endomorphism
of

yields
[cf.
our
assumption
that
C
is
of

type!]
a
homomorphism
of
monoids
F
→
EndC
(A)
—
which,
by
applying
Proposition
1.11,
(iii),
lifts
to
a
homomorphism
of
monoids
pl-bk
→
C)bs-iso
,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
F
→
End(CA
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
Since
assertion
(ii)
clearly
only
concerns
the
Frobenioid
C
istr
[cf.
Proposition
1.9,
(v)],
we
may
replace
C
by
C
istr
and
assume
for
the
remainder
of
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii)
that
C
is
of
isotropic
type.
Now
the
necessity
of
the
three
conditions
(a),
(b),
(c)
follows
immediately
[cf.
Remark
1.1.1]
from
the
fact
that
endomorphisms
of
“O×
”
are
LB-invertible
base-identity
linear
endomorphisms.
To
show
the
suﬃciency
of
these
three
conditions,
we
apply
the
factorization
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iv),
(a)
[cf.
also
Proposition
1.4,
(i)],
the
essential
uniqueness
of
morphisms
of
Frobenius
type
of
a
given
Frobenius
degree
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(ii)],
and
the
equivalence
of
categories
[involving
pull-back
morphisms]
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(i),
(c),
to
α1
,
α2
.
Then
conditions
(a),
(c)
imply
that
there
exist
morphisms
γ
:
A
→
C;
β1
,
β2
:
C
→
D;
δ
:
D
→
B,
where
γ
is
a
morphism
of
Frobenius
type,
β1
and
β2
are
base-equivalent
co-angular
pre-steps,
and
δ
:
D
→
B
is
a
pull-back
morphism
such
that
α1
=
δ
◦
β1
◦
γ,
α2
=
δ
◦
β2
◦
γ.
Since
δ,
γ
are
LB-invertible,
it
thus
follows
from
condition
(b)
[cf.
also
Remark
1.1.1]
that
Div(β1
)
=
Div(β2
),
hence
[by
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(vi)]
that
β2
=
ζ
◦
β1
,
for
some
ζ
∈
O×
(D).
Since
α1
=
δ
◦
(β1
◦
γ),
α2
=
δ
◦
ζ
◦
(β1
◦
γ),
we
thus
conclude
that
O×
α1
≈
α2
,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Now
assertion
(iii)
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions.
In
light
of
assertions
(ii),
(iii),
assertion
(iv)
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions.
As
for
assertion
(v),
the
necessity
of
the
condition
in
the
statement
of
assertion
(v)
follows
immediately
from
Proposition
1.5,
(i),
(ii).
To
verify
the
suﬃciency
of
this
condition,
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
if
C
is
of
unit-trivial
and
base-trivial
type,
then
[by
the
existence
of
isotropic
hulls
in
C
—
cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(vii),
(a)]
it
follows
that
C
is
also
of
isotropic
type,
hence
that
we
have
a
natural
equivalence
of
categories
∼
C
→
C
un-tr
[cf.
assertion
(iii)].
Thus,
by
assertion
(iv),
it
follows
that
the
natural
functor
C
→
FΦ
is
faithful
and
essentially
surjective.
Since
C
is
of
base-trivial
and
Aut-ample
type,
it
follows
from
the
factorization
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iv),
(a)
[cf.
also
the
existence
and
uniqueness
of
morphisms
of
Frobenius
type
of
a
given
Frobenius
degree
asserted
in
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(ii);
the
equivalence
of
categories
involving
pullback
morphisms
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(i),
(c)],
that
to
show
that
C
→
FΦ
is
full,
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
it
is
surjective
on
base-identity
pre-step
endomorphisms
[i.e.,
on
“O
(−)”];
but,
by
our
assumption
that
C
is
of
base-trivial
and
Aut-ample
type,
this
follows
immediately
from
the
ﬁrst
equivalence
of
categories
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(v).

Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
Since
iso-subanchors
are
manifestly
preserved
by
any
equivalence
of

it
follows
from
our
assumption
that

Now,
with
the
exception
of
the
ﬁnal
statement
concerning
the
rigidity
of

the
remainder
of
assertion
(i)
follows
formally
from
[the
deﬁnitions
and]
Proposition
1.9,
(v),
(vi),
(vii).
The
ﬁnal
statement
concerning
the
rigidity
of
the
composite
functors
may
be
veriﬁed
as
follows:
By
Proposition
1.13,
(ii),
it
suﬃces
to
show,
for
each
A
∈
Ob(C

)
that
the
automorphism
α
∈

(A)
induced
by
an

is
trivial.
But,
by
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(i),
(a),
(b);
(iii),
(c),
it
suﬃces
to
show
this
when
A
is
Frobenius-trivial,
in
which
case
the
triviality
of
α
follows
from
the
functoriality
of
α
with
respect
to
base-identity
endomorphisms
of
A
of
arbitrary
of
Frobenius
degree
[which
implies,
since
C1
,
C2
are
of
Frobeniusnormalized
type,
that
αd
=
α,
for
all
d
∈
N≥1
,
hence
that
α
is
trivial,
as
desired].
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
By
assertion
(i)
[cf.
also
Proposition
1.9,
(v)],
and
the
characterization
of
co-angular
pre-steps
given
in
Proposition
1.7,
(iv),
we
reduce
immediately
to
the
case
where
C1
,
C2
are
of
isotropic
type.
Then
[since
any
equivalence
of
categories
manifestly
preserves
FSM-morphisms
and
irreducible
morphisms]
the
fact
that
Ψ
preserves
pre-steps
follows
formally
from
Proposition
1.14,
(ii),
(iii).
Since
Ψ
preserves
pre-steps,
it
thus
follows
from
Proposition
1.8,
(iii)
[cf.
64
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
also
Proposition
1.4,
(i)],
that
Ψ
preserves
group-like
objects.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertions
(i),
(ii).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
First,
I
claim
that
to
verify
assertion
(iii),
it
suﬃces
to
prove
that,
for
each
prime
p1
∈
Primes,
there
exists
a
prime
p2
∈
Primes,
which
is
equal
to
p1
if
C1
,
C2
are
not
of
group-like
type,
such
that
Ψistr
maps
p1
Frobenius
morphisms
to
p2
-Frobenius
morphisms.
Indeed,
the
assignment
p1
→
p2
determines
a
homomorphism
of
monoids
ΨN≥1
:
N≥1
→
N≥1
which
[by
considering
a
quasi-inverse
to
Ψ]
is
easily
seen
to
be
an
automorphism.
Moreover,
by
Proposition
1.10,
(v),
the
condition
of
the
claim
implies
that
Ψistr
preserves
morphisms
of
Frobenius
type,
hence
also
linear
morphisms
[by
Proposition
1.7,
(iii)],
and
maps
morphisms
of
Frobenius
degree
d
to
morphisms
of
Frobenius
degree
ΨN≥1
(d)
[i.e.,
since
arbitrary
morphisms
may
be
written
as
composites
of
prime-Frobenius
morphisms
and
linear
morphisms
—
cf.
Remark
1.1.1;
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iv),
(a);
Proposition
1.10,
(v)].
Since
the
isotropiﬁcation
functor
preserves
Frobenius
degrees,
this
implies
that
Ψ
maps
morphisms
of
Frobenius
degree
d
to
morphisms
of
Frobenius
degree
ΨN≥1
(d),
hence
that
Ψ
preserves
linear
morphisms
and
morphisms
of
Frobenius
type
[by
Proposition
1.7,
(iii)].
Moreover,
by
assertions
(i),
(ii),
Ψ
preserves
isometric
pre-steps
and
pre-steps,
hence
base-isomorphisms
[i.e.,
composites
of
pre-steps
and
morphisms
of
Frobenius
type
—
cf.
Proposition
1.7,
(ii)],
pull-back
morphisms
[cf.
Proposition
1.7,
(ii)],
isometries
[i.e.,
morphisms
that
map
via
the
isotropiﬁcation
functor
to
composites
of
a
morphism
of
Frobenius
type
and
a
pull-back
morphism
—
cf.
Propositions
1.4,
(i),
(v);
1.9,
(v)],
co-angular
morphisms
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.2,
(iii);
assertion
(i)
for
isometric
pre-steps],
and
LBinvertible
morphisms.
Now
it
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
C
pf
[cf.
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(iii)]
that
we
obtain
a
1-unique
1-commutative
diagram
as
in
the
statement
of
assertion
(iii).
Finally,
to
verify
the
asserted
rigidity
of
composite
functors,
it
suﬃces
[cf.
the
argument
applied
in
the
proof
of
assertion
(i)]
to
apply
Proposition
1.13,
(ii),
and
to
consider
the
functoriality
of
the
automorphisms
in
question
with
respect
to
base-identity
endomorphisms
of
Frobenius-trivial
objects
of
arbitrary
Frobenius
degree.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
claim.
Thus,
to
complete
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii),
we
may
assume
[for
the
remainder
of
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii)]
that
C1
,
C2
are
of
isotropic
type
[cf.
assertion
(i)].
Then
it
suﬃces
to
prove
that,
for
each
prime
p1
∈
Primes,
there
exists
a
prime
p2
∈
Primes,
which
is
equal
to
p1
if
C1
,
C2
are
not
of
group-like
type,
such
that
Ψ
maps
p1
Frobenius
morphisms
to
p2
-Frobenius
morphisms.
Let
us
call
an
object
A1
∈
Ob(C1
)
(p1
,
p2
)-admissible
if
Ψ
maps
every
p1
-Frobenius
morphism
with
domain
A1
to
a
p2
-Frobenius
morphism
of
C2
.
Now
let
us
consider
the
following
assertions:
(F1)
For
each
prime
p1
∈
Primes,
there
exist
a
prime
p2
∈
Primes
and
a
(p1
,
p2
)-admissible
object
of
C1
.
(F2)
For
every
pair
of
primes
p1
,
p2
∈
Primes
and
every
morphism
ζ1
:
A1
→
B1
in
C1
,
A1
is
(p1
,
p2
)-admissible
if
and
only
if
B1
is.

(F3)
If
C1
,
C2
are
not
of
group-like
type,
then
for
each
prime
p
∈
Primes,
there
exist
a
(p,
p)-admissible
object
of
C1
.
Observe,
moreover,
that
since
C1
is
connected,
to
complete
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii),
it
suﬃces
to
prove
(F1),
(F2),
(F3).
First,
we
consider
assertion
(F1).
Let
us
ﬁrst
consider
the
case
where
C1
,
C2
are
of
group-like
type.
Then
all
pre-steps
of
C1
,
C2
are
isomorphisms;
Ψ
preserves
base-isomorphisms.
Thus,
for
any
A1
∈
Ob(C1
),
the
prime-Frobenius
morphisms
with
domain
A1
are
precisely
the
irreducible
base-isomorphisms
with
domain
A1
[cf.
Proposition
1.14,
(i)].
In
particular,
Ψ
preserves
the
prime-Frobenius
morphisms;
hence,
we
conclude
that
assertion
(F1)
holds.
Next,
let
us
consider
the
case
where
C1
,
C2
are
not
of
group-like
type.
Then
if
A1
is
non-group-like,
then
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(i),
(a);
Proposition
1.8,
(iii)],
there
exists
a
base-isomorphic
[i.e.,
to
A1
],
hence
non-group-like,
Frobenius-trivial
object
of
C1
.
Thus,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
A1
is
Frobenius-trivial.
Then
for
any
p1
∈
Primes,
there
exists
a
base-identity
[hence
Div-identity]
p1
-Frobenius
endomorphism
φ1
of
A1
.
Since
[by
assertion
(ii)]
Ψ
preserves
pre-steps,
it
thus
follows
formally
from
the
characterization
of
“Div-identity
prime-Frobenius
endomorphisms”
given
in
Proposition
1.14,
def
(v),
that
Ψ
maps
φ1
to
a
prime-Frobenius
endomorphism
of
A2
=
Ψ(A1
).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(F1).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(F2).
First,
observe
that
if
the
morphism
ζ1
:
A1
→
B1
is
a
pre-step,
then
[since,
by
assertion
(ii),
Ψ
preserves
pre-steps]
it
follows
by
applying
Proposition
1.14,
(iv),
to
commutative
diagrams
such
as
the
one
given
in
Proposition
1.10,
(i),
that
assertion
(F2)
holds.
Thus,
by
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(i),
(a),
(b),
(c),
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
B1
is
Frobenius-trivial,
and
that
ζ1
is
a
pull-back
morphism.
Now,
by
applying
Proposition
1.11,
(iii),
it
follows
that
for
every
p1
∈
Primes,
there
exist
base-identity
p1
-Frobenius
endomorphisms
φ1
∈
EndC
(A1
),
ψ1
∈
EndC
(B1
)
such
that
ψ1
◦
ζ1
=
ζ1
◦
φ1
.
In
particular,
if
we
def
def
def
write
φ2
=
Ψ(φ1
),
ψ2
=
Ψ(ψ1
),
ζ2
=
Ψ(ζ1
),
then
ψ2
◦
ζ2
=
ζ2
◦
φ2
,
and
φ2
,
ψ2
are
irreducible.
Thus,
by
Proposition
1.14,
(iv),
we
obtain
that
φ2
is
a
p2
-Frobenius
morphism
if
and
only
if
ψ2
is.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(F2).
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(F3).
Let
A1
∈
Ob(C1
)
be
a
non-group-like,
Frobenius-trivial
object
[cf.
the
proof
of
assertion
(F1)].
By
assertions
(F1),
(F2),
it
follows
already
that
Ψ
preserves
prime-Frobenius
morphisms.
Thus,
to
complete
the
proof
of
assertion
(F3),
[since
the
Frobenius
degree
of
a
prime-Frobenius
morphism
is
always
a
prime
number]
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
if
ζ1
,
θ1
∈
EndC1
(A1
)
are
prime-Frobenius
base-identity
endomorphisms
such
that
degFr
(ζ1
)
<
degFr
(θ1
),
def
def
then
degFr
(ζ2
)
<
degFr
(θ2
)
[where
ζ2
=
Ψ(ζ1
),
θ2
=
Ψ(θ1
)].
But,
by
the
ﬁrst
equivalence
of
categories
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d)
[cf.
also
Proposition
1.10,
(i)],
the
condition
“degFr
(ζ1
)
<
degFr
(θ1
)”
is
equivalent
to
the
following
condition:
If
we
write
βζ1
(respectively,
βθ1
)
for
the
step
“β
◦
α”
of
Proposition
1.14,
(v),
obtained
when
one
takes
“φ”
of
loc.
cit.
to
be
ζ1
(respectively,
θ1
)
[and
“α”
of
loc.
cit.
to
be
some
ﬁxed
step],
then
βθ1
=
γ1
◦
βζ1
,
for
some
step
γ1
.

Thus,
if
we
write
βζ2
(respectively,
βθ2
)
for
the
step
“β
◦
α”
of
Proposition
1.14,
(v),
obtained
when
one
takes
“φ”
of
loc.
cit.
to
be
ζ2
(respectively,
θ2
)
[and
“α”
of
loc.
cit.
to
be
some
ﬁxed
step],
then
βθ2
=
γ2
◦
βζ2
,
for
some
step
γ2
[since,
by
assertion
(ii),
we
already
know
that
Ψ
preserves
pre-steps],
which
[again
by
the
ﬁrst
equivalence
of
categories
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d);
Proposition
1.10,
(i)]
implies
that
degFr
(ζ2
)
<
degFr
(θ2
),
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(F3),
hence
also
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii).
Next,
let
us
observe
that
by
assertion
(i)
[cf.
also
Proposition
1.9,
(v)],
it
suﬃces
to
verify
assertions
(iv),
(v),
under
the
further
assumption
that
C1
,
C2
are
of
isotropic
type;
thus,
we
assume
for
the
remainder
of
the
proof
of
Theorem
3.4
that
C1
,
C2
are
of
isotropic
type.
Also,
to
simplify
notation
[for
the
remainder
of
the
proof
of
Theorem
3.4],
let
us
write
def
Pi
=
Cipl-bk
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(i),
(c)],
for
i
=
1,
2.
Next,
let
us
consider
assertion
(iv).
Now,
for
i
=
1,
2,
it
follows
formally
[in
light
of
our
assumption
that
Di
is
Frobenius-slim]
from
Proposition
3.3,
(i)
[cf.
also
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(i),
(a),
(b);
(iii),
(c)],
that
if
C
∈
Ob(Ci
),
then
the
endomorphisms
of
O
(C)
are
precisely
the
endomorphisms
γ
∈
EndCi
(C)
such
that
the
following
condition
is
satisﬁed:
There
exist
pre-steps
φ
:
A
→
B,
ψ
:
A
→
C
and
endomorphisms
α
∈
EndCi
(A),
β
∈
EndCi
(B)
such
that
β
◦
φ
=
φ
◦
α,
γ
◦
ψ
=
ψ
◦
α,
and,
moreover,
α
arises
as
the
endomorphism
of
A
induced
by
the
image
of
1
∈
Z≥0
⊆
F
via
a
homomorphism
of
monoids
F
→
End((Pi
)A
→
Ci
)bs-iso
.
By
assertions
(ii),
(iii),
it
follows
that
Ψ
preserves
pre-steps,
base-isomorphisms,
and
pull-back
morphisms,
hence
that
Ψ
preserves
endomorphisms
satisfying
the
above
condition.
Thus,
we
conclude
that
Ψ
preserves
the
submonoids
“O
(−)”,
“O×
(−)”,
as
desired.
The
existence
of
a
a
1-unique
functor
Ψun-tr
:
C1un-tr
→
C2un-tr
that
ﬁts
into
a
1-commutative
diagram
as
in
the
statement
of
assertion
(iv)
then
follows
formally
from
the
deﬁnition
of
“C1un-tr
”,
“C2un-tr
”;
since
“C1un-tr
”,
“C2un-tr
”
are
of
unit-trivial
type,
the
asserted
rigidity
follows
formally
from
Proposition
1.13,
(ii).
Thus,
to
complete
the
proof
of
assertion
(iv),
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
ΨN≥1
is
the
identity
automorphism.
If
C1
,
C2
are
not
of
group-like
type,
then
this
already
follows
formally
from
assertion
(iii).
Thus,
let
us
assume
for
the
remainder
of
the
proof
of
assertion
(iv)
that
C1
,
C2
are
of
group-like
type.
Observe
that
there
exists
def
an
object
A1
∈
Ob(C1
)
such
that
A2
=
Ψ(A1
)
is
Frobenius-compact
[cf.
Deﬁnition
3.1;
the
fact
that
Ψ
is
an
equivalence
of
categories].
By
Proposition
1.10,
(vi),
A1
,
A2
are
Frobenius-trivial.
Let
φ1
∈
EndC1
(A1
)
be
a
base-identity
prime-Frobenius
def
endomorphism.
By
assertion
(iii),
φ2
=
Ψ(φ1
)
is
also
a
prime-Frobenius
morphism.
Write
φ2
=
α
◦
ψ2
,
where
ψ2
is
a
base-identity
prime-Frobenius
endomorphism

A2
,
and
α
∈
AutC2
(A2
)
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(ii)].
Now
since
C1
,
C2
are
of
Frobeniusnormalized
type
[cf.
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(i),
(c)],
it
follows
that
for
every
u1
∈
O×
(A1
),
def
up11
◦
φ1
=
φ1
◦
u1
[where
p1
=
degFr
(φ1
)].
Thus,
for
u2
∈
O×
(A2
),
we
obtain
up21
◦
φ2
=
φ2
◦
u2
=
α
◦
ψ2
◦
u2
=
α
◦
up22
◦
ψ2
=
α
◦
up22
◦
α−1
◦
α
◦
ψ2
=
α
◦
up22
◦
α−1
◦
φ2
def
[where
p2
=
degFr
(φ2
)],
hence
[by
the
total
epimorphicity
of
C2
]
up21
=
α
◦
up22
◦
α−1
—
i.e.,
α
acts
on
O×
(A2
)pf
by
multiplication
by
p1
/p2
.
Since
A2
is
Frobeniuscompact,
we
thus
conclude
that
p1
=
p2
.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iv).
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(v).
Now,
for
i

1,
2,
if
A
∈
Ob(Ci

=
Ob(Pi

def
AD

Base(A)

then

Moreover,
if

AD

then

of

in

Moreover,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
this

ﬁts
into

Next,

Thus,
since

essentially
surjective
[cf.

it

a

Next,
let
us
observe
that
if
A,

AD

AD

then
any

may
be
written
in
the
form
φD

Base(ψ)

Base(γ)

Base(α)−1
—
where
α

ψ
:

A
is
a
pull-back

[cf.

Since
[by
the

any

induces
an

def
def
[where
D,
E

DD

Base(D),
ED
=

it
thus
follows
that
any
collection
of
morphisms
α,
γ,
ψ
as
just
described
determine
a
“new
functor”
(Pi
)AD

(Pi

[i.e.,
by
inverting
the
equivalence
of
categories
induced
by
α
and
then
composing
with
the
functors
induced
by
γ,
ψ].
Thus,
by
enlarging
the
2-slim
2-category
of
1-categories
considered
above
[i.e.,
whose
coarsiﬁcation
we
called
Qi
]
by
considering
these
“new

we
obtain
a
[slightly
larger]
2-slim
2-category
of
1-categories,
whose
coarsiﬁcation
we
denote
by
Ri
.
In
particular,
we
obtain
a
[faithful]
embedding
Qi
→
Ri
with
the
property
that
the
functor
Qi

Di
considered

admits
a
natural
extension
to
a
functor
Ri

Di
which
[by
the
above
discussion]
is
clearly
an
equivalence
of
categories.
On
the
other
hand,
since
[by
assertions
(ii),
(iii)]
Ψ
preserves
pre-steps,
pullback
morphisms,
and
factorizations
as
in
Deﬁnition
1.3,

it
follows
that

[cf.

Remark
3.4.1.
With
regard
to
assumption
(b)
of
Theorem
3.4,
(iii),
(iv),
(v),
we
observe
the
following:
Suppose,
in
the
situation
of
Theorem
3.4,
that
C1
,
C2
are
of
group-like
and
quasi-isotropic
type.
Then
if
Ψ
and
some
quasi-inverse
to
Ψ
preserve
Frobenius
degrees,
then
they
also
preserve
base-isomorphisms.
Indeed,
by
Theorem
3.4,
(i),
we
may
assume,
without
loss
of
generality,
that
C1
,
C2
are
of
isotropic
type.
Then
if
Ψ
and
some
quasi-inverse
to
Ψ
preserve
Frobenius
degrees,
then
they
preserve
linear
morphisms,
hence
morphisms
of
Frobenius
type
[cf.
Proposition
1.7,
(iii)]
and
base-isomorphisms
[i.e.,
morphisms
of
Frobenius
type,
since
C1
,
C2
are
of
group-like
and
isotropic
type
—
cf.
Propositions
1.4,
(i);
1.7,
(ii);
1.8,
(iii)].
One
way
to
understand
the
meaning
of
the
conditions
imposed
in
the
various
portions
of
Theorem
3.4
is
by
considering
examples
in
which
some
of
the
conditions
hold,
but
others
do
not.
Example
3.5.
Base
Categories
with
FSMI-endomorphisms.
Let
D
be
a
one-object
category
whose
unique
object
has
endomorphism
monoid
F;
C
a
oneobject
category
whose
unique
object
has
endomorphism
monoid
F
×
F.
Thus,
the
projection
F
×
F
→
F
to
the
ﬁrst
factor
determines
a
functor
C
→
D;
C
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
elementary
Frobenioid
determined
by
the
[manifestly
nondilating]
monoid
on
D
that
assigns
to
the
unique
object
of
D
the
monoid
Z≥0
and
to
every
morphism
of
D
the
identity
automorphism
of
Z≥0
.
In
particular,
C
is
a
Frobenioid
of
Frobenius-normalized
and
isotropic
type,
which
is
not
of
group-like
type
[cf.
Proposition
1.5,
(i),
(ii)].
On
the
other
hand,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
every
morphism
of
D
is
an
FSM-morphism,
and
that
the
endomorphism
1
∈
Z≥0
⊆
F
of
the
unique
object
of
D
is
irreducible.
Thus,
D
admits
an
FSMI-endomorphism,
which
implies
[cf.
§0]
that
D
fails
to
be
of
FSMFF-type.

[cf.

[cf.

One
veriﬁes
immediately
that

either
anisomorphism

a
non-monomorphism
[cf.
the
existence
of

are
precisely
the
morphisms
that
project

the
natural
surjection

to

of

Thus,
it
follows
immediately
that
D
is
of
FSM-,
hence
also
of
FSMFF-type.
Moreover,
since

it
follows
that

Thus,

Let

a

we
denote
by
Z(G);
D
a
one-object

has

C
a

Thus,
the

be

with

assigns

unique

of

the

and
to
every

of

the

In

C
is
a
Frobenioid
of
Frobenius-normalized

isotropic
type,
which
is
not
of

D
is

THE
GEOMETRY
OF
FROBENIOIDS
I
73
Finally,
before
proceeding,
we
consider
the
case
of
Frobenioids
of
group-like
type
in
a
bit
more
detail.
Proposition
3.11.
(Frobenioids
of
Isotropic,
Unit-trivial,
and
Grouplike
Type)
For
i
=
1,
2,
let
Φi
be
the
zero
monoid
[more
precisely:
any
functor
Di
→
Mon
all
of
whose
values
are
monoids
of
cardinality
one]
on
a
connected,
totally
epimorphic
category
Di
of
FSMFF-type;
Ci
→
FΦi
a
Frobenioid
of
isotropic,
unit-trivial,
and
group-like
type;
∼
Ψ
:
C1
→
C2
an
equivalence
of
categories.
Then:
(i)
The
functor
Ci
→
FΦi
is
an
equivalence
of
categories.
(ii)
Ψ
preserves
base-isomorphisms,
pull-back
morphisms,
linear
morphisms,
and
morphisms
of
Frobenius
type.
(iii)
Suppose
that
both
Ψ
and
some
quasi-inverse
to
Ψ
preserve
base-identity
endomorphisms.
Then
there
exists
a
1-unique
functor
ΨBase
:
D1
→
D2
that
ﬁts
into
a
1-commutative
diagram
C1
⏐
⏐
D1
Ψ
−→
ΨBase
−→
C2
⏐
⏐
D2
[where
the
vertical
arrows
are
the
natural
projection
functors;
the
horizontal
arrows
are
equivalences
of
categories].
Finally,
if
D1
,
D2
are
slim,
then
each
of
the
composite
functors
of
this
diagram
is
rigid.
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
By
Proposition
3.3,
(iii),
(iv),
the
functor
Ci
→
FΦi
is
essentially
surjective
and
faithful.
Since
the
Frobenioid
Ci
is
of
grouplike
and
isotropic
type,
it
follows
that
every
pre-step
of
Ci
is
an
isomorphism
[cf.
Propositions
1.4,
(i);
1.8,
(iii)],
hence
that
the
Frobenioid
Ci
is
of
Aut-ample
and
base-trivial
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(i),
(b)],
as
well
as
unit-trivial,
type.
Thus,
it
follows
from
Proposition
3.3,
(v),
that
the
functor
Ci
→
FΦi
is
an
equivalence
of
categories.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
Observe
that
since
Di
is
of
FSMFF-type,
it
follows
that
Di
has
no
FSMI-endomorphisms
[cf.
§0],
hence
that
a
morphism
of
Ci
is
an
FSMI-endomorphism
if
and
only
if
it
is
a
prime-Frobenius
endomorphism
[cf.
Propositions
1.11,
(vi);
1.14,
(i);
the
evident
structure
of
FΦi
].
Thus,
Ψ
preserves
the
prime-Frobenius
endomorphisms,
hence
also
prime-Frobenius
morphisms
[since
every
prime-Frobenius
morphism
is
abstractly
equivalent
to
a
prime-Frobenius
endomorphism].
But
this
implies
that
Ψ
preserves
the
morphisms
of
Frobenius
type
[cf.
Proposition
1.10,
(v)],
hence
also
the
linear
morphisms
[cf.
Proposition
1.7,
(iii)].
Since
the
[co-angular]
pre-steps
of
Ci
are
isomorphisms
[cf.
Proposition
1.8,
74
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
(iii)],
it
thus
follows
that
Ψ
preserves
the
pull-back
morphisms
[cf.
Proposition
1.7,
(iii)],
as
well
as
the
base-isomorphisms
[cf.
Proposition
1.7,
(ii)].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
Write
N
for
the
one-object
category
whose
unique
object
has
endomorphism
monoid
equal
to
N≥1
.
Then
we
have
equivalences
of
categories
∼
∼
Ci
→
FΦi
→
Di
×
N
[cf.
assertion
(i)].
Moreover,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
the
base-identity
endo∼
morphisms
of
Ci
are
precisely
the
endomorphisms
of
Ci
→
Di
×
N
that
arise
from
elements
of
N≥1
;
let
us
refer
to
such
endomorphisms
as
“N≥1
-endomorphisms”.
Thus,
it
follows
from
our
assumption
concerning
the
preservation
of
base-identity
endomorphisms
that
the
N≥1
-endomorphisms
are
preserved
by
Ψ.
Note,
moreover,
that
Di
may
be
reconstructed
from
Ci
by
considering
equivalence
classes
of
morphisms
of
Ci
,
where
two
morphisms
of
Ci
are
regarded
as
equivalent
if
they
admit
composites
with
an
N≥1
-endomorphism
which
are
equal.
Thus,
we
obtain
a
1-commutative
diagram
as
in
the
statement
of
assertion
(ii).
Finally,
the
rigidity
assertion
in
the
statement
of
assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
Proposition
1.13,
(i).

Section
4:
Category-theoreticity
of
the
Divisor
Monoid
In
the
present
§4,
we
show
that
the
monoid
on
the
base
category
that
appears
in
the
deﬁnition
of
a
Frobenioid
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3]
may,
under
suitable
conditions,
be
reconstructed
entirely
category-theoretically.
Together
with
the
results
of
§3,
this
allows
us
to
conclude,
under
suitable
conditions,
that
the
functor
to
an
elementary
Frobenioid
that
appears
in
the
deﬁnition
of
a
Frobenioid
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3]
may
be
recovered
entirely
from
the
structure
of
a
Frobenioid
as
an
abstract
category
[cf.
Corollary
4.11].
In
the
following
discussion,
we
maintain
the
notation
of
§1,
§2,
§3.
Also,
we
assume
that
we
have
been
given
a
divisorial
monoid
Φ
on
a
connected,
totally
epimorphic
category
D
and
a
Frobenioid
C
→
FΦ
.
Proposition
4.1.
(Primary
Steps)
Suppose
further
that
C
is
of
perfect
and
isotropic
type,
and
that
Φ
is
perf-factorial.
Let
A

For

Then:

where

Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
By
applying
the
second
equivalence
of
categories
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d),
to
the
various
pre-steps
over
A,
it
follows
def
that,
if
we
write
xφ
=
φ∗
(Div(φ))
∈
Φ(A)
[where
we
write
φ∗
for
the
bijection
induced
by
the
functor
Φ],
then
the
condition
of
assertion
(i)
may
be
translated
into
the
language
of
monoids
as
follows:
For
every
equation
xφ
=
xA
+
xB
in
Φ(A),
where
xA
,
xB
=
0,
we
have
xφ

x
A
.
Now
the
equivalence
of
this
condition
with
the
condition
that
xφ
is
primary
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
the
term
“primary”
[cf.
§0],
together
with
the
fact
that
Φ(A)
is
perfect
[cf.
Proposition
1.10,
(iii)].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
Again,
we
apply
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d),
to
the
various
pre-steps
over
C,
to
obtain
the
following
translation
of
the
condition
of
asdef
def
sertion
(ii)
into
the
language
of
monoids
[where
we
set
xφ
=
ψ∗
(φ∗
(Div(φ))),
xψ
=
ψ∗
(Div(ψ))
∈
Φ(C)]:
For
every
equation
xφ
+
xψ
=
xφ
+
xψ

in
Φ(A),
where
xφ
,
xψ

=
0,
there
exists
a
0
=
xφ
∈
Φ(A)
such
that
xφ
≤
xφ
,
xφ
≤
xφ
.
Now
the
necessity
of
this
condition
follows
immediately
from
the
structure
of
the
Φ(A)p
,
where
p
∈
Prime(Φ(A))
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.4,
(i),
(b)],
whereas
the
suﬃciency
of
this
condition
follows
by
taking
xφ
≤
xψ
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.4,
(i),
(c),
(d);
the
fact
that
Φ(A)
is
perfect].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
By
applying
the
second
equivalence
of
categories
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d),
to
the
various
pre-steps
over
F
,
we
obtain
the
following
translation
of
the
condition
of
assertion
(iii)
into
the
language
of
monoids
def
def
[where
we
set
x
=

xι

∈
Φ(F
)]:
Every
xζ
∈
Φ(F
)
such
that
xζ
≤
x
,
xζ
≤
xι
is,
in
fact,
equal
to
0.

The
necessity
and
suﬃciency
of
this
condition
then
follow
immediately
by
considering
the
“primary
factorizations”
of
x
,
xι
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.4,
(i),
(c),
(d);
the
fact
that
Φ(A)
is
perfect].
The
cartesian
diagram
[with
the
desired
properties]
then
follows
from
the
fact
that
“for

x

only
if
x

[cf.

This

Next,
we

(iv).
This

we
apply
the

of

1.3,

to

Also,
we
observe
that

the

which
we
shall
refer
to,
respectively,
as
the
right-hand
and
left-hand
isomorphisms
induced
by
Ψ
[cf.
Example
4.3
below].
Proof.
First,
we
observe
that
by
Proposition
1.10,
(vi),
every
group-like
object
is
Frobenius-trivial,
hence,
in
particular,
Div-Frobenius-trivial;
moreover,
[by
the
deﬁnition
of
a
“group-like
object”]
every
endomorphism
of
a
group-like
object
is
a
Div-identity
endomorphism,
and
every
pre-step
to
or
from
a
group-like
object
is
an
isomorphism
[cf.
Propositions
1.4,
(i),
(iii);
1.8,
(iii)].
Thus,
since
Ψ
preserves
non-group-like
objects
[cf.
Theorem
3.4,
(ii)]
and
pull-back
morphisms
[cf.
Theorem
3.4,
(iii)],
we
may
assume
for
the
remainder
of
the
proof
of
Theorem
4.2,
without
loss
of
generality,
that
the
objects
under
consideration
are
non-group-like.
Now
by
Proposition
1.14,
(v)
[cf.
also
Theorem
3.4,
(ii)],
it
follows
immediately
that
Ψ
preserves
non-group-like
Div-Frobenius-trivial
objects,
as
well
as
Div-identity
prime-Frobenius
endomorphisms
of
such
objects.
Since
Ψ
preserves
morphisms
of
Frobenius
type
and
Frobenius
degrees
[cf.
Theorem
3.4,
(iii)],
we
thus
conclude
that
to
complete
the
proof
of
assertion
(i),
it
suﬃces
to
prove
that
Ψ
preserves
primary
steps
and
Div-identity
endomorphisms.
Moreover,
to
prove
the
remainder
of
assertion
(i)
[i.e.,
that
Ψ
preserves
primary
steps
and
Div-identity
endomorphisms]
and
assertions
(ii),
(iii),
clearly
it
suﬃces
to
do
so
after
passing
to
the
perfections
of
the
Ci
[cf.
Theorem
3.4,
(iii)];
thus,
for
the
remainder
of
the
proof
of
Theorem
4.2,
we
may
assume,
without
loss
of
generality,
that
the
Ci
are
of
perfect
type
[cf.
also
Proposition
5.5,
(iii),
below].
def
Now
let
A1
∈
Ob(C1
)
be
a
non-group-like
Div-Frobenius-trivial
object;
A2
=
Ψ(A1
).
Then
it
follows
formally
from
Proposition
4.1,
(i),
(ii)
[cf.
also
Theorem
3.4,
(ii),
(iii)]
that
Ψ
maps
primary
steps
to
or
from
A1
to
primary
steps
to
or
from
A2
in
such
a
way
that
primary
steps
B1
→
A1
,
A1
→
C1
with
primary
composite
B1
→
C1
are
mapped
to
primary
steps
B2
→
A2
,
A2
→
C2
with
primary
composite
B2
→
C2
.
Next,
let
A1
→
F1
be
a
primary
step.
Then
it
follows
immediately
from
Proposition
4.1,
(iii),
together
with
what
we
have
already
shown
concerning
primary
steps
to
or
from
A1
,
that
Ψ
def
maps
primary
steps
to
or
from
F1
to
primary
steps
to
or
from
F2
=
Ψ(F1
)

with

.
[Indeed,
to
see
this,
it
suﬃces
to
consider
the
following
two
situations
[depending
on
whether
the
primary
steps
A1

F1
→

are
co-primary
or
not]:
(a)
primary

Bi

Ai
,
Ai

Ci
with
primary

such
that
the
primary

to

are

all

originating
from
Ai
,
as
well
as
the
vertical
composite
Ai

Ai
→
Ai
,
are
primary
steps.]
Next,
observe
that
for
a
suitable
choice
of
non-group-like
Div-Frobenius-trivial
A1
[e.g.,
a
Frobenius-trivial
A1
—
cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(i),
(a),
(b)],
it
follows
that
for
any
object
C1
∈
Ob(C1
)
that
is
base-isomorphic
to
A1
,
there
exist
pre-steps
B1
→
C1
,
B1
→
A1
.
Moreover,
observe
that
[by
applying
the
equivalences
of
categories
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d)]
any
primary
step
to
or
from
B1
,
as
well
as
any
primary
composite
of
a
primary
step
to
B1
with
a
primary
step
from
B1
,
may
always
be
written
in
the
form
D1

E1
where
the
composite
D1
→
E1
→
F1
of
the
above
arrow
D1
→
E1
with
some
arrow
E1
→
F1
factors
as
a
composite
D1

B1
→
A1
→
F1
in
which
D1
→
B1
is
a
prestep,
B1
→
A1
is
the
pre-step
introduced
above,
and
A1
→
F1
is
a
primary
step
[so
in
the
case
of
a
primary
step
from
B1
,
D1
=
B1
;
in
the
case
of
a
primary
step
to
B1
,
E1
=
B1
].
Thus,
by
applying
Proposition
4.1,
(iv)
[to
the
arrows
D1
→
E1
→
F1
],
together
with
what
we
have
already
shown
concerning
primary
steps
to
or
from
F1
,
we
conclude
that
Ψ
maps
primary
steps
to
or
from
B1
to
primary
steps
to
or
def
from
B2
=
Ψ(B1

in
such
a
way
that
primary

B1

In
a
similar
vein,
we
observe
that
[by
applying
the
equivalences
of
categories
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d)]
a
primary
step
to
or
from
C1
,
as
well
as
any
primary
composite
of
a
primary
step
to
C1
with
a
primary
step
from
C1
,
may
always
be
written
in
the
form
E1

F1
where
the
composite
D1
→
E1
→
F1
of
some
arrow
D1
→
E1
with
the
above
arrow
E1
→
F1
factors
as
a
composite
D1

B1
→
C1
→
F1
in
which
D1
→
B1
is
a
primary
pre-step,
B1
→
C1
is
the
pre-step
introduced
above,
and
C1
→
F1
is
a
pre-step
[so
in
the
case
of
a
primary
step
from
C1
,
E1
=
C1
;
in
the
case
of
80
SHINICHI

a
primary
step
to
C1
,
F1
=
C1
].
Thus,
by
applying
Proposition
4.1,
(v)
[to
the
arrows
D1
→
E1
→
F1
],
together
with
what
we
have
already
shown
concerning
primary
steps
to
or
from
D1
[i.e.,
where
we
regard
“D1
”
as
a
“sort
of
B1
”,
which
is
possible
in
light
of
the
existence
of
the
composite
pre-step
D1
→
B1
→
A1
],
we
conclude
that
Ψ
maps
primary
steps
to
or
from
C1
to
primary
steps
to
or
from
def
C2
=
Ψ(C1
)
in
such
a
way
that
primary
steps
C1
→
C1
,
C1
→
C1
with
primary
composite
C1
→
C1
are
mapped
to
primary
steps
C2
→
C2
,
C2
→
C2
with
primary
composite
C2
→
C2
.
Since
C1
was,
in
eﬀect,
allowed
to
be
an
arbitrary
non-group-like
object
of
C1
,
we
thus
conclude
that
Ψ
preserves
primary
steps.
Moreover,
by
thinking,
for
Ai
∈
Ob(Ci
)
[where
i
=
1,
2]
of
an
element
of
Prime(Φi
(Ai
))
as
an
equivalence
class
of
primary
steps
to
or
from
Ai
[where
the
correspondence
between
elements
of
Prime(Φi
(Ai
))
and
equivalence
classes
of
primary
steps
is
deﬁned
by
“Div(−)”
—
cf.
the
equivalences
of
categories
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d)],
we
thus
obtain
that
Ψ
induces
a
bijection
∼
ΨPrime
(A1
)
:
Prime(Φ1
(A1
))
→
Prime(Φ2
(A2

def
[where
A2

as

as

p1
∈
Prime(Φ1

p2
∈

correspond
via
ΨPrime

To
check
the
functoriality
of
ΨPrime
(−)
with
respect
to
arbitrary
base-isomorphisms,
it
suﬃces
to
check
it
with
respect
to
morphisms
of
Frobenius
type
and
presteps
[cf.
Proposition
1.7,
(ii)].
In
the
case
of
a
morphism
of
Frobenius
type
Bi

Ai
[where
i
=

the
desired

and
the

In
the
case
of
a

the

follows
by

or
the

This
completes
the
proof
of
the
functoriality
of
ΨPrime

hence
of
assertion
(ii).
Next,
we
observe
that
Ψ
preserves
Div-identity

since

it
follows
that

This
completes
the

Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
Thus,
we
assume
that

As
the

the

do

[cf.

Let
D
be
a
one-morphism
category;
Φ
the
monoid
on
D
whose
value
on
the
unique
object
of
D
is
the
monoid
Q≥0
.
Now
we
deﬁne
a
category
C
as
follows:
The
objects
of
C
are
the
elements
of
Q.
The
morphisms
a
→
b
of
C
from
an
object
a
∈
Q
to
an
object
b
∈
Q
are
the
elements
d
∈
N≥1
such
that
d
·
a
≤
b;
composition
of
morphisms
is
deﬁned
by
multiplication
of
elements
of
N≥1
.
We
shall
refer
to
the
element
d
∈
N≥1
determined
by
a
morphism
of
C
as
the
Frobenius
degree
of
the
morphism.
Thus,
we
obtain
a
natural
functor
C
→
FΦ
by
assigning
to
a
morphism
φ
:
a
→
b
[where
a,
b
∈
Q]
the
zero
divisor
b
−
degFr
(φ)
·
a
∈
Q≥0
and
Frobenius
degree
degFr
(φ)
∈
N≥1
.
Since
C
is
clearly
connected
and
totally
epimorphic,
this
functor
determines
a
pre-Frobenioid
structure
on
C.
Moreover,
the
object
0
∈
Q
is
Frobenius-trivial;
φ
:
a

b
is
a
morphism
of
Frobenius
type
if
and
only
if
b

a;
φ
:
a

a

if
and
only
if
degFr
(φ)
=
1;
all
morphisms
of
C
are
base-isomorphisms;
all
pull-back
morphisms
of
C
are
isomorphisms;
all
“O

of
C
are
trivial;
no
object
of
C
is
group-like.
Thus,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
C
is
a
Frobenioid
of
isotropic
type.
Since
D
is
clearly
of
FSMFF-type,
and
Φ
is
non-dilating,
it
follows
that
C
is
also
of
standard
type,
over
a
slim
base
category
D.
Now
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
if
λ
∈
Q>0
,
then
the
assignment,
for
a
∈
Q≥0
,
a
→
a;
−a
→
−λ
·
a
determines
a
self-equivalence
of
categories
∼
Ψλ
:
C
→
C
that
preserves
Frobenius
degrees
[cf.
Theorem
3.4,
(iii)].
On
the
other
hand,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
construction
of
Ψλ
that
the
right-hand
isomorphism
of
Theorem
4.2,
(iii),
is
the
identity
on
Q≥0
,
while
the
left-hand
isomorphism
of
Theorem
4.2,
(iii),
is
given
by
multiplication
by
λ
on
Q≥0
.
In
order
to
proceed
further
toward
the
goal
of
“reconstructing
Φ
categorytheoretically
from
C”,
it
is
necessary
to
ﬁnd
natural
conditions
on
the
Frobenioid
C
that
will
allow
us
to
rule
out
“pathologies”
of
the
sort
discussed
in
Example
4.3.
One
approach
to
doing
this
is
the
introduction
of
the
birationalization
of
a
Frobenioid,
as
follows.

Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
Given
morphisms
φ
:
A
→
B,
ψ

:
B

→
C
[in
C]
and
co-angular
pre-steps
α
:
A
→
A,
β
:
B

→
B
[in
C],
it
follows
from
Proposition
1.11,
(vii),
that
there
exists
a
commutative
diagram

A
←−
A
φ
−→
B
where
α
[hence
also
α
◦
α
]
is
a
co-angular
pre-step.
Then
we
take
the
composite
of
(A,
B)
with
the
image
of
ψ

in
Hombirat
(B,
C)
to
be
the
the
image
of
φ
in
Hombirat
C
C
birat


image
of
ψ
◦
φ
in
HomC
(A,
C).
To
show
that
this
assignment
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
α
,
φ
,
it
suﬃces
to
consider
commutative
diagrams
α∗

α
A
φ
−→
B
[where
α
,
α
,
α∗
are
co-angular
pre-steps]
and
to
observe
that
since
β
is
a
monomorphism
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(v),
(a)],
the
fact
that
β
◦
φ
◦
α∗
=
φ
◦
α
◦
α∗
=
φ
◦
α
◦
α
=
β
◦
φ
◦
α
implies
that
φ
◦α∗
=
φ
◦α
,
i.e.,
that
ψ

◦φ
,
ψ

◦φ
determine
the
same
element
(A,
C).
Also,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
composite
of
morphisms
of
of
Hombirat
C
Hombirat
(−,
−)
is
associative.
This
completes
the
deﬁnition
of
the
category
C
birat
.
C
Then
by
assigning
to
the
pair
(α
:
A
→
A,
φ
:
A
→
B)
the
element
Φ(α)−1
{Div(φ
)
−
degFr
(φ
)
·
Div(α)}
∈
Φ(A)gp
[cf.
Remark
1.1.1]
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
the
functor
C
→
FΦ
induces
a
functor
C
birat
→
FΦgp
,
as
well
as
a
1-commutative
diagram
as
in
the
statement
of
assertion
(i).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Next,
we
observe
that
it
follows
formally
from
the
deﬁnition
of
C
birat
that
C
birat
is
connected;
moreover,
[cf.
the
discussion
of
the
composition
of
arrows
of
C
birat
in
the
proof
of
assertion
(i)]
the
total
epimorphicity
of
C
birat
follows
immediately
from
that
of
C.
Thus,
the
functor
C
birat
→
F0D
determines
a
structure
of
pre-Frobenioid
on
C
birat
.
Now
the
portion
of
assertion
(iv)
concerning
morphisms
of
a
given
Frobenius
degree,
isometries
[cf.
the
monoid
structure
of
the
monoid
0D
!],
pre-steps,
base-isomorphisms,
and
base-identity
endomorphisms
of
C
birat
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions.
The
portion
of
assertion
(iv)
concerning
co-angular
pre-steps
(−,
−)”;
Proposition
1.7,
of
C
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
“Hombirat
C
(v)
[for
co-angular
pre-steps].
To
verify
the
portion
of
assertion
(iv)
concerning
co-angular
morphisms,
we
reason
as
follows:
Given
a
morphism
Abirat
→
B
birat
in
C
birat
,
any
factorization
THE
GEOMETRY
OF
FROBENIOIDS
I
85
Abirat
→
C
birat
→
Dbirat
→
B
birat
in
C
birat
,
where
either
Abirat
→
C
birat
or
Dbirat
→
B
birat
is
a
base-isomorphism,
C
birat
→
Dbirat
is
a(n)
[isometric]
prestep,
and
Dbirat
→
B
birat
is
linear,
arises
[cf.
the
proof
of
assertion
(i)]
from
a
factorization
A
→
C

→
D
→
B
in
C,
where
either
A
→
C

or
D
→
B
is
a
base-isomorphism,
C

→
D
is
a
pre-step,
and
D
→
B
is
linear.
Thus,
if
A
→
B
is
co-angular,
then
[by
applying
the
factorization
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(v),
(b),
to
C

→
D
,
we
conclude
that]
C

→
D
is
a
co-angular
pre-step,
so
C
birat
→
Dbirat
is
an
isomorphism;
in
particular,
it
follows
that
Abirat
→
B
birat
is
co-angular.
On
the
other
hand,
if
Abirat
→
B
birat
is
co-angular,
then
C
birat
→
Dbirat
is
an
isomorphism,
which
[by
the
portion
of
assertion
(iv)
concerning
isomorphisms
of
C
birat
]
implies
that
C

→
D
is
a
co-angular
pre-step,
hence
an
isomorphism
whenever
it
is
an
isometry
[cf.
Proposition
1.4,
(iii)];
thus,
A
→
B,
hence
also
any
morphism
A
→
B
appearing
in
a
factorization
A
→
A
→
B
[where
A
→
A
is
a
co-angular
pre-step],
is
co-angular.
The
portion
of
assertion
(iv)
concerning
morphisms
of
Frobenius
type
now
follows
formally
from
the
portion
of
assertion
(iv)
concerning
co-angular
morphisms,
isometries,
and
base-isomorphisms.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
it
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnition
of
a
pull-back
morphism
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.2,
(ii)]
that
any
pull-back
morphism
of
C
maps
to
a
pull-back
morphism
of
C
birat
.
Since,
moreover,
a
morphism
of
C
is
a
co-angular
linear
morphism
if
and
only
if
it
is
a
composite
of
a
co-angular
pre-step
and
a
pull-back
morphism
[cf.
Propositions
1.4,
(iv);
1.7,
(iii)],
it
thus
follows
[cf.
the
portion
of
assertion
(iv)
concerning
co-angular
pre-steps
of
C]
that
every
co-angular
linear
morphism
of
C
maps
to
a
pull-back
morphism
of
C
birat
.
On
the
other
hand,
if
φ
:
A
→
B
is
a
morphism
of
C
that
maps
to
a
pull-back
morphism
φbirat
:
Abirat
→
B
birat
of
C
birat
,
then
it
follows
that
φ
is
linear,
hence
that
it
factors
as
a
composite
γ
◦
α,
where
α
:
A
→
C
is
a
pre-step,
and
γ
:
C
→
B
is
a
pull-back
morphism
[cf.
Proposition
1.7,
(iii)].
Thus,
we
obtain
an
equation
φbirat
=
γ
birat
◦
αbirat
in
C
birat
,
where
φbirat
,
γ
birat
are
pull-back
morphisms,
and
αbirat
is
a
base-isomorphism;
but
[by
the
isomorphism
of
functors
appearing
in
the
deﬁnition
of
a
“pull-back
morphism”
in
Deﬁnition
1.2,
(ii)]
this
implies
formally
that
αbirat
is
an
isomorphism,
hence
[by
the
portion
of
assertion
(iv)
concerning
co-angular
pre-steps
of
C]
that
α
is
a
co-angular
pre-step,
as
desired.
Finally,
the
portion
of
assertion
(iv)
concerning
isotropic
objects
follows
immediately
from
the
portion
of
assertion
(iv)
concerning
pre-steps
and
co-angular
pre-steps;
Proposition
1.4,
(i),
(iii);
Proposition
1.9,
(iv).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iv).
In
light
of
the
“dictionary”
provided
by
assertion
(iv)
[cf.
also
Proposition
1.4,
(iv);
the
equivalence
of
categories
of
Proposition
1.9,
(ii)],
it
is
now
a
routine
exercise
to
check
that
C
birat
is,
in
fact,
a
Frobenioid
of
group-like
type.
Moreover,
it
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions
[and
the
total
epimorphicity
of
C]
that
the
functor
C
→
C
birat
is
faithful
and
determines
an
injection
O
(A)gp
→
O×
(Abirat
),
for
A
∈
Ob(C).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Now
assertion
(iii)
follows
immediately
from
the
existence
of
the
functor
C
birat
→
FΦgp
of
assertion
(i)
[cf.
also
Proposition
1.5,
(ii)];
here,
we
note
that
the
computation
of
the
kernel
of
the
surjection
of
assertion
(iii)
follows
from
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(vi).

We

that
it

αp
commutes
with
all
αp
,
for
p
∈
Primes.
Thus,
we
obtain
a
homomorphism
N≥1
→
End(M
),
i.e.,
an
action
of
N≥1
on
M
;
write
αn
for
the
image
in
End(M
)
of
n
∈
N≥1

Write
N
for
the
monoid
whose
underlying
set

and
whose
monoid
structure
is
given
as
follows:
If
λ,
μ
∈
M
;
l,
m
∈
N≥1
,
then
(λ,
l)
·
(μ,
m)
=
(λ
+
αl
(μ),
l
·
m).
Now
let
D
be
a
one-morphism
category;
Φ
the
monoid
on
D
whose
unique
value
is
given
by
Z≥0
×
Z≥0
.
Let
C
be
the
category
whose
objects
An
are
indexed
by
elements
n
∈
Z,
and
whose
morphisms
An1
→
An2
[where
n1
,
n2
∈
Z]
consist
of
elements
(g,
a,
b,
d)
∈
N
such
that
a
≥
0,
b
≥
0,
n2
−d·n1
=
a+b;
composition
of
morphisms
is
determined
by
the
product
structure
of
N
.
The
assignment
(g,
a,
b,
d)
→
(a,
b,
d)
then
determines
a
functor
C
→
FΦ
[which
lies
over
D].
Moreover,
one
checks
immediately
that,
relative
to
this
last
functor,
C
is
a
Frobenioid
of
isotropic
and
standard
type
which
is
not
of
group-like
type.
Also,
we
observe
that
the
object
A0
∈
Ob(C)
is
Frobenius-trivial,
and
that
for
every
A
∈
Ob(C),
O×
(A)
=
O
(A)
=
G.
On
the
other
hand,
one
computes
easily
that
for
Abirat
∈
Ob(C
birat
),
O×
(Abirat
)
=
M0
,
where
we
write
M0
⊆
M
for
the
subgroup
of
(g,
a,
b)
∈
M
such
that
a
+
b
=
0.
Moreover,
the
morphisms
)
(0,
0,
0,
d)
∈
N
determine
a
homomorphism
N≥1
→
EndC
(A0
)
→
EndCbirat
(Abirat
0
[where
we
write
use
the
superscript
“birat”
to
denote
the
image
of
objects
of
C
in
C
birat
],
hence
an
action
of
N≥1
on
O×
(Abirat
)
=
M0
,
which
is
easily
veriﬁed
to
coincide
with
the
restriction
to
M0
of
the
original
action
of
N≥1
on
M
.
Now
observe
that
C
is
of
[strictly]
rational
type
[cf.
Deﬁnition
4.5,
(ii)],
and,
moreover,
every
object
of
(C
un-tr
)birat
is
Frobenius-compact.
On
the
other
hand,
if
the
ξp
=
0
[so
αp
does
not
act
on
M0
by
multiplication
by
p],
then
C
fails
to
be
of
birationally
Frobenius-normalized
type.
[In
a
similar
vein,
we
note
that
although
C
birat
is
“very
similar”
to
an
elementary
Frobenioid,
the
presence
of
the
“ξp
’s”
means
that
it
is
not,
in
general,
an
elementary
Frobenioid.]
Example

Suppose
that
the

Φ
:
D

maps
every

to
an

automorphism
of
Mon.
Then
it
follows
formally
that
D
is
Div-slim
if
and
only
if
D
is
slim.
In
particular,
if,
for
instance,
D
is
a
one-object
category,
A

Ob(D),
and
EndD

a

then
Aut(DA

so

D

not

Let

Then

[cf.
the

that

But
this
implies
[cf.

that

as
desired.
In
light
of

We
are
now

“reconstruct

Theorem
4.9.
(Category-theoreticity
of
Divisor
Monoids)
For
i
=
1,
2,
let
Φi
be
a
divisorial
monoid
on
a
connected,
totally
epimorphic
category
Di
;
Ci
→
FΦi
a
Frobenioid
of

∼
Ψ
:
C1
→

an
equivalence
of

Then
there
exists
an

of

[where
we
regard,
for
i
=

the
functor
Φi
:
Di
→
Mon
as
a

on
Ci

by
restriction
via
the

functor

lying
over
Ψ,
which
is

compatible
[when
the
Ci
are
of
isotropic,
but
not
of
group-like
type]
with
the
isomorphism
ΨPrime
of
Theorem
4.2,
(ii).
Proof.
First,
we
observe
[cf.
Theorem
3.4,
(i),
(ii)]
that
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
C1
,
C2
are
of
isotropic
type
[cf.
Remark
4.5.1],
but
not
of
group-like
type
[since
Theorem
4.9
is
vacuous
if
C1
,
C2
are
of
group-like
type].
Next,
I
claim
that
to
complete
the
proof
of
Theorem
4.9,
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
the
right-hand
and
left-hand
isomorphisms
of
Theorem
4.2,
(iii),
coincide
[cf.
Remark
4.9.1
below],
for
all
universally
Div-Frobenius-trivial
objects
[e.g.,
Frobeniustrivial
objects
—
cf.
Remark
1.11.1].
Indeed,
if
the
right-hand
and
left-hand
isomorphisms
of
Theorem
4.2,
(iii),
coincide
for
all
universally
Div-Frobenius-trivial
objects,
then
it
follows
immediately
from
the
construction
of
the
isomorphism
of
functors
ΨPrime
in
the
proof
of
Theorem
4.2,
(ii),
that
ΨPrime
extends,
for
Ai
∈
Ob(Cibs-iso
),
pi
∈
Prime(Φi
(Ai
))
[where
i
=
1,
2]
such
that
A2
=
Ψ(A1
),
p2
=
ΨPrime
(p1
),
to
an
isomorphism
of
monoids
∼
pf
Φ1
(A1
)pf
p1
→
Φ2
(A2
)p2
which
is
functorial
in
A1
[regarded
as
an
object
of
C1bs-iso
].
Thus,
by
allowing
the
pi
to
vary,
we
obtain,
for
Ai
∈
Ob(Cibs-iso
)
[where
i
=
1,
2]
such
that
A2
=
Ψ(A1
),
an
isomorphism
of
monoids
∼
pf
Φ1
(A1
)pf
factor
→
Φ2
(A2
)factor
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.4,
(i),
(c)]
which
is
functorial
in
A1
[regarded
as
an
object
of
C1bs-iso
].
Moreover,
by
applying,
say,
the
ﬁrst
equivalence
of
categories
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d),
to
obtain
pre-steps
φ
:
A
→
B
of
Ci
with
arbitrary
prescribed
zero
divisor
and
considering
primary
steps
ψ
:
A
→
C
such
that
φ
=
ζ
◦
ψ
for
some
pre-step
ζ,
one
concludes
immediately
that
this
subset
maps
the
subset
Φ1
(A1
)
⊆
Φ1
(A1
)pf
factor
[cf.
pf
Deﬁnition
2.4,
(i),
(c)]
onto
the
subset
Φ2
(A2
)
⊆
Φ2
(A2
)factor
,
hence
determines
an
isomorphism
of
monoids
∼
Φ1
(A1
)
→
Φ2
(A2
)
which
is
functorial
in
A1
[regarded
as
an
object
of
C1bs-iso
].
Finally,
the
functoriality
of
this
isomorphism
of
monoids
with
respect
to
pull-back
morphisms
follows
immediately
by
“pulling
back
pre-steps”,
as
in
Proposition
1.11,
(v).
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
claim.
To
prove
that
the
right-hand
and
left-hand
isomorphisms
of
Theorem
4.2,
(iii),
coincide
for
all
universally
Div-Frobenius-trivial
objects,
we
reason
as
follows.
First
of
all,
by
passing
to
perfections
[cf.
Theorem
3.4,
(iii)],
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
C1
,
C2
are
of
perfect
type
[cf.
also
Proposition
5.5,
(iii),
below].
Let
A
be
a
universally
Div-Frobenius-trivial
object
of
Ci
[where
i
=
1,
2].
Since
the
right-hand
and
left-hand
isomorphisms
of
Theorem
4.2,
(iii),
are
clearly
compatible
with
pull-back
morphisms
[cf.
Proposition
1.11,
(v);
the
proof
of
Theorem
4.2,
(iii)],
and
Ψ
preserves
pull-back
morphisms
[cf.
Theorem
3.4,
(iii)],
it
follows
that
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
A
is
strictly
rational.
Let
us
refer
to
pairs
90

B,
γ
:
C
→
A
such
that
Div(β)
=
(Φi
(γ))−1
(Div(γ))
as
twin-primary
steps.
Then,
it
suﬃces
to
show,
for
each
p
∈
Prime(Φ1
(A)),
the
existence
of
twin-primary
steps
with
zero
divisor
in
p
that
are
mapped
by

to

steps
of
C2

On
the
other
hand,
since
A
is
strictly
rational,
it
follows
[cf.
Deﬁnition
4.5,

that
there
exist,
for
each

[cf.

Moreover,
each
of
the
composite
functors
of
this
diagram
is

Proof.
First,
we
observe
[cf.
Theorem
3.4,
(i)]
that
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
C1
,
C2
are
of
isotropic
type
[cf.
Remark
4.5.1].
Also,
if
C1
,
C2
are
of
group-like
type
[cf.
Theorem
3.4,
(ii)],
then
“Div-slimness”
amounts
to
“slimness”,
so
assertions
(i),
(ii)
follow
from
Theorem
3.4,
(iv),
(v);
assertion
(iii)
is
vacuous;
assertion
(iv)
follows
from
the
fact
that
Ψ
preserves
Frobenius
degrees
[cf.
Theorem
3.4,
(iii),
(iv)].
Thus,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
C1
,
C2
are
not
of
group-like
type.
Now
we
consider
assertion
(i).
To
show
the
existence
and
1-uniqueness
of
a
1-commutative
diagram
as
in
the
statement
of
assertion
(i),
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
Ψ
preserves
“O×
(−)”
[cf.
the
proof
of
Theorem
3.4,
(iv)].
But
observe
that,
for
A
∈
Ob(Ci
),
an
element
f
∈
O×
(A)
determines
an
automorphism
[cf.
the
proof
of
Proposition
3.3,
(i)]
φf
∈
Aut((Cipl-bk
)A
→
Ci
)
def
that
maps
to
the
identity
in
Aut((Di
)AD
→
Di
)
[where
AD
=
Base(A)
—
cf.
∼
the
equivalence
of
categories
(Cipl-bk
)A
→
(Di
)AD
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(i),
(c)],
hence
also
to
the
identity
in
Aut((Di
)AD
→
Mon)
[i.e.,
via
composition
with
Φi
].
Since
Di
is
Div-slim,
it
thus
follows
that
the
elements
of
O×
(A)
⊆
AutCi
(A)
may
be
characterized
as
the
automorphisms
of
A
that
arise
from
automorphisms
φ
∈
Aut((Cipl-bk
)A
→
Ci
)
THE
GEOMETRY
OF
FROBENIOIDS
I
93
such
that
every
automorphism
[of
an
object
of
Ci
]
induced
by
φ
is
a
Div-identity
automorphism.
Thus,
since
Ψ
preserves
pull-back
morphisms
[cf.
Theorem
3.4,
(iii)]
and
Div-identity
automorphisms
[cf.
Theorem
4.2,
(i);
our
assumption
that
the
Φi
are
perf-factorial],
we
thus
conclude
that
Ψ
preserves
“O×
(−)”,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
existence
and
1-uniqueness
of
a
1-commutative
diagram
as
in
the
statement
of
assertion
(i).
The
rigidity
assertion
in
the
statement
of
assertion
(i)
follows
by
observing
that
if
α
∈
Aut(Ci
→
Ciun-tr
),
then
every
automorphism
[of
an
object
of
Ciun-tr
]
induced
by
α
is
a
Div-identity
automorphism.
[Indeed,
this
follows
by
applying
the
functoriality
of
α
to
[co-angular]
pre-steps,
in
light
of
the
second
equivalence
of
categories
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d).]
In
particular,
it
follows
that
if
A
∈
Ob(Ci
),
def
AD
=
Base(A),
then
the
element
∼
αA
∈
Aut((Cipl-bk
)A
→
Di
)
→
Aut((Di
)AD
→
Di
)
determined
by
α
maps
[under
composition
with
Φi
:
Di
→
Mon]
to
the
identity
element
of
Aut((Di
)AD
→
Mon).
Thus,
since
Di
is
Div-slim,
it
follows
that
every
automorphism
[of
an
object
of
Ciun-tr
]
induced
by
α
is
a
base-identity
automorphism,
hence
trivial
[since
Ciun-tr
is
of
unit-trivial
type].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
First,
let
us
observe
that
we
obtain
a
1commutative
diagram
Ψ
−→
C2
C1
⏐
⏐
⏐
⏐
C1birat
Ψbirat
−→
C2birat
[cf.
Corollary
4.10].
Since,
moreover,
the
base-isomorphisms
of
Cibirat
are
precisely
the
morphisms
of
Cibirat
which
are
abstractly
equivalent
to
morphisms
that
arise
from
base-isomorphisms
of
Ci
[cf.
Proposition
4.4,
(iv)],
it
follows
that
Ψbirat
preserves
base-isomorphisms,
hence
also
pull-back
morphisms
[cf.
Proposition
1.7,
(ii)].
Thus,
since
Di
is
Div-slim,
the
base-identity
endomorphisms
of
A
∈
Ob(Cibirat
)
may
be
characterized
as
the
endomorphisms
of
A
that
arise
from
endomorphisms

Cibirat
)
φ
∈
End((Cibirat
)pl-bk
A
such
that
every
endomorphism
[of
an
object
of
Cibirat
]
induced
by
φ
projects
to
an
automorphism
of
Di
that
is
mapped
by
Φi
to
an
identity
automorphism.
Since,
by
Theorem
4.2,
(ii)
[cf.
also
the
fact
that
the
Φi
are
perf-factorial
and
nondilating],
it
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
Cibirat
that
Ψbirat
preserves
those
endomorphisms
[of
an
object
of
Cibirat
]
that
project
to
an
automorphism
of
Di
that
is
mapped
by
Φi
to
an
identity
automorphism,
we
thus
conclude
that
Ψbirat
preserves
the
base-identity
endomorphisms
[hence,
in
particular,
that
Ψbirat
preserves
“O×
(−)”].
Thus,
we
obtain
a
1-commutative
diagram

[where
the
vertical

the

Since,
moreover,
the
Frobenioids
(Cibirat
)un-tr
are
of
isotropic,
unit-trivial,
and
group-like
type,
we
thus
conclude
that
we
obtain

Thus,
by
composing
diagrams,
we
obtain
a
1-commutative
diagram
as
in
the
statement
of
assertion
(ii),
which
is
easily
veriﬁed
to
be
1-unique.
Finally,
the
rigidity
assertion
in
the
statement
of
assertion
(ii)
follows
from
Proposition
1.13,
(i).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Next,
we
observe
that
assertion
(iii)
follows
formally
from
assertion
(ii);
Theorem
4.9
[cf.
also
Deﬁnition
1.3,

the
technique
of
using
the
equivalence
∼
of

“D

applied
in

Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iv).
In
light
of
the
structure
of
an

Frobenioid
[cf.

1.1,

the
existence
of
a
1-commutative

simply
by
concatenating
assertions
(ii),
(iii),
with
the
fact
that
Ψ
preserves
Frobenius
degrees
[cf.
Theorem
3.4,
(iii)].
Finally,
the
rigidity
assertion
follows
via
the
same
argument
as
was
applied
to
prove
the
rigidity
assertion
that
appears
in
the
statement
of

(i).
This
completes

proof
of

Remark
4.11.1.
Note
that
since
“slim

Div-slim”,
it
follows
that,
at

when
the
divisorial
monoids
involved
are
perf-factorial,
Corollary
4.11,
(ii),
constitutes
a
substantial
strengthening
of
Theorem
3.4,
(v).
Remark
4.11.2.
Observe
that
in
Example
3.9,
since
the
subgroup
U

G

Aut(DA

D)
[where
A

acts
trivially
on

,
it
follows
that
D
fails
to

Div-slim,
so
the
non-preservation
of
units
that
occurs
in
this
example
does
not
contradict
Corollary
4.11,
(i),
(ii).
In
a
similar
vein,
in
Example
3.10,
since
G
=
Aut(DA

D)
[where
A
∈
Ob(D)]
acts
trivially
on
Z≥0

it
follows
that
D
fails
to

Div-slim,
so
the
non-preservation
of

endomorphisms
that
occurs
in

example
does
not
contradict

Moreover,

Proof.
First,
we
observe
[cf.

that
we
may
assume
without
loss
of

that

,
C2

[cf.

Now
the

identiﬁed
with
the
natural
functors
Ci

In
particular,
if
C1

[cf.
Theorem

then
[since

Corollary

from

Thus,
we
may
assume
without

that

Then
Corollary

follows
by
applying
Corollary

to
pass
from
Ci
to
Cibirat
[where
we
note

[where
we

which
allows

to
pass
from
Cibirat

Finally,
the

follows
from

This

the

Remark
4.12.1.
One
veriﬁes
immediately
that
if
one
takes
the
group
G

then
the
Frobenioid

In

one
may
apply
Corollary
4.12
to
the
self-equivalence
of

of
Example
3.10.
On
the
other
hand,
since
this
self-equivalence
fails
to
preserve

it
follows
that
it
is

the
extent
to

an

type
may
be
constructed
explicitly

a

will
be

Moreover,
if

then
its

The

In
particular,
the

of
a

completely
determined

the

all

Suppose
that

Then
any

determines
a
base-section
of
C;
any
base-section
of
C
admits
an
associated
Frobenius-section
F
.
Moreover,
C
is
of
model
type.
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
Let
us
refer
to
a(n)
[ordered]
pair
of
presteps
as
an
A-pair
if
the
ﬁrst
pre-step
has
codomain
A,
and
the
second
pre-step
has
the
same
domain
as
the
ﬁrst;
let
us
say
that
two
A-pairs
(φ
:
B
→
A,
ψ
:
B
→
C);
∼
(φ
:
B

→
A,
ψ
:
B

→
C

)
are
isomorphic
if
there
exist
isomorphisms
ιB
:
B
→
B

,
∼
ιC
:
C
→
C

such
that
φ
◦
ιB
=
φ,
ψ

◦
ιB
=
ιC
◦
ψ.
Then
observe
that
by
the
equivalences
of
categories
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d),
it
follows
that
the
assignment
(φ
:
B
→
A,
ψ
:
B
→
C)
→
(Φ(φ)−1
(Div(φ)),
Φ(φ)−1
(Div(ψ)))
∈
Φ(A)
×
Φ(A)
determines
a
bijection
from
the
set
of
isomorphism
classes
of
A-pairs
onto
Φ(A)
×
Φ(A);
in
particular,
we
obtain
a
map
Φ(A)
×
Φ(A)
→
PicC
(A).
Moreover,
relative
to
this
bijection,
replacing
an
element
(x,
y)
∈
Φ(A)
×
Φ(A)
by
an
element
(x
+
z,
y
+
z)
∈
Φ(A)
×
Φ(A)
[where
z
∈
Φ(A)]
corresponds
to
replacing
(φ
:
B
→
A,
ψ
:
B
→
C)
by
(φ
◦
δ,
ψ
◦
δ),
for
some
pre-step
δ;
in
particular,
such
replacements
do
not
aﬀect
the
element
of
PicC
(A)
determined
by
the
A-pair.
Now
I
claim
that
the
map
Φ(A)
×
Φ(A)
→
PicC
(A)
of
the
above
discussion
factors
through
PicΦ
(A).
Indeed,
suppose
that
(x,
y)
∈
Φ(A)
×
Φ(A),
(x
,
y

)
∈
Φ(A)
×
Φ(A)
map
to
the
same
element
of
PicΦ
(A).
Then,
by
the
deﬁnition
of
“Φbirat
(A)”
[cf.
the
statements
and
proofs
of
Proposition
4.4,
(i),
(iii)],
it
follows
that
there
exists
a
pair
of
base-equivalent
pre-steps
δ1
,
δ2
:
D
→
A
such
that
Φ(δ1


+

for
some
z
∈
Φ(A)
[cf.
also
the
deﬁnition
of

thus,
by
replacing
δ1
,
δ2
by
the
composite
of
δ1
,
δ2
with
an
appropriate
pre-step
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d)],
we
may
assume
that
Φ(δ1
)−1
(Div(δ1
))
=
x
+
y

+
z

;
Φ(δ2

(Div(δ2

=

98

for

[for

z
=

by
replacing
(x,
y)
by
(x
+
z

,
y
+
z

)
[cf.
discussion
of
the
the
preceding
paragraph],
it
follows
that
we
may
assume,
without
loss
of
generality,
that
z

=
0.
Next,
by
applying
the
ﬁrst
equivalence
of
categories
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d),
we
observe
that
there
exists
a
pre-step
δ
†
:
D
→
D†
such
that
Div(δ
†
)
=
Φ(δi
)(x
+
x
+
y
+
y

),
where
i
=
1,
2
[and
we
note
that
Φ(δi
)
is
independent
of
i,
since
δ1
,
δ2
are
base-equivalent].
Thus,
[again
by
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d)]
we
conclude
that
there
exist
base-equivalent
pre-steps
δ1A
,
δ2A
:
A
→
D†
such
that
δ
†
=
δ2A
◦
δ1
=
δ1A
◦
δ2
.
In
particular,
we
have
Div(δ1A
)
=
x
+
y

,
Div(δ2A
)
=
x
+
y.
Let
:
E
→
A
be
a
pre-step
with
Φ(
)−1
(Div(
))
=
x
+
x
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d)];
(φ
:
B
→
A,
ψ
:
B
→
C)
an
A-pair
that
corresponds
to
(x,
y);
(φ
:
B

→
A,
ψ

:
B

→
C

)
an
A-pair
that
corresponds
to
(x
,
y

).
Then
since
x,
x
≤
x
+
x
,
it
follows
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d)]
that
there
exist
factorizations
=
φ
◦
η,
=
φ
◦
η

,
where
η
:
E
→
B,
η

:
E
→
B

are
pre-steps.
Moreover,
by
applying
the
the
second
equivalence
of
categories
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d),
to
D†
,
we
conclude
from
the
existence
of
the
composites
of
:
E
→
A
with
δ1A
,
δ2A
:
A
→
D†
that
there
exists
a
pre-step
F
:
F
→
D†
and
a
pair
of
base-equivalent
pre-steps
δ1E
,
δ2E
:
E
→
F
such
that
the
following
relations
hold:
F
◦
δ1E
=
δ1A
◦
;
F
Div(δ1E
)
=
(Φ(
))(x
+
y

);
◦
δ2E
=
δ2A
◦
Div(δ2E
)
=
(Φ(
))(x
+
y)
[so
Φ(
F
)−1
(Div(
F
))
=
Φ(δiA
)−1
(x
+
x
),
for
i
=
1,
2].
On
the
other
hand,
since
Div(ψ
◦
η)
=
(Φ(
))(x
+
y)
=
Div(δ2E
),
Div(ψ

◦
η

)
=
(Φ(
))(x
+
y

)
=
Div(δ1E
),
we
thus
conclude
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d),
applied
to
the
pairs
of
pre-steps
(ψ
◦
η
:
E
→
C,
δ2E
:
E

F
)
and
(ψ

◦
η

:
E

C

,
δ1E
:
E

F
)
emanating
from
E]

that
there
exists
an

ι

C

such
that
Base(ψ

Base(ι

◦
Base(φ)−1

◦

That
is
to

we
have
a

In

we
conclude
that

(C

Base(φ

determine
the

(A).
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
claim.
Thus,
we
obtain
a
map
PicΦ

→
PicC
(A).
It
follows
immediately
from
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(i),
(b),
that
this
map
is
a
surjection.
To
show
that
this

is

it
suﬃces
to
consider
(x,

(x

Let

be

that

(φ

an

By

that

it

that

may
assume
that

Thus,

Thus,
it

that

hence
determine

veriﬁed

This
completes
the
proof
of
the
injectivity,
hence
also
of
the
bijectivity
of
the
map
PicΦ
(A)
→
PicC
(A).
Also,
the
portion
of
assertion
(i)
concerning
morphisms
of
Frobenius
type
follows
easily
by
considering
commutative
diagrams
as
in
Proposition
1.10,
(i).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Now
assertion
(ii)
follows
formally
from
assertion
(i)
[cf.
also
Remark
1.1.1;
the
factorization
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iv),
(a);
the
faithfulness
portion
of
Proposition
3.3,
(iv)].
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
First,
let
us
observe
that
by
assertion
(i),
any
∼
isom
isomorphism
αD
:
AD
→
AD
determines
an
object
(A
,
α)
∈
Ob(C
×D
DA
)
which
D

[in
light
of
the
fact
that
A
is
Frobenius-trivial,
hence
admits
base-identity
endomorphisms
of
Frobenius
type
of
arbitrary
prescribed
Frobenius
degree]
corresponds
[via
the
bijection
of
assertion
(i)]
to
an
element
ξ
∈
PicΦ
(A)
such
that
d
·
ξ
=
ξ,
for
all
d
∈
N≥1
.
Thus,
taking
d
=
2
implies
that
ξ
=
0,
i.e.,
[cf.
the
deﬁnition
of
∼
PicC
(A)]
that
there
exists
an
isomorphism
α
:
A
→
A
such
that
αD
=
Base(α).
In
particular,
we
conclude
that
base-isomorphic
Frobenius-trivial
objects
of
C
are,
in
fact,
isomorphic,
and
that
all
Frobenius-trivial
objects
of
C
are
Aut-ample.
In
light
of
these
observations,
it
follows
immediately
that
C
Fr-tr
satisﬁes
the
conditions
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
i.e.,
that
C
Fr-tr
is
a
Frobenioid
[of
isotropic,
group-like,
base-trivial,
and
Aut-ample
type].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii).
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iv).
First,
we
observe
that
since
C
is
of
unittrivial
type,
it
follows
immediately
[cf.,
e.g.,
Proposition
3.3,
(iii),
(iv)]
that
given
any
two
objects
A,
B
∈
Ob(C),
a
pull-back
morphism
A
→
B
(respectively,
baseidentity
endomorphism
of
Frobenius
type
of
A)
is
uniquely
determined
by
its
projection
to
D
(respectively,
by
its
Frobenius
degree).
Moreover,
by
assertion
(iii),
it
follows
immediately
that
if
A,
B
∈
Ob(C
Fr-tr
),
then
any
morphism
Base(A)
→
Base(B)
[in
D]
lifts
to
a
pull-back
morphism
of
C
Fr-tr
.
Thus,
we
conclude
that
the
natural
projection
functor
(C
Fr-tr
)pl-bk
→
D
is
an
equivalence
of
categories,
hence
that
any
skeletal
subcategory
P
⊆
(C
Fr-tr
)pl-bk
determines
a
base-section
of
C,
and
that
any
base-section
of
C
admits
an
associated
100
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
Frobenius-section.
Moreover,
since
C
is
of
unit-trivial
type,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
structure
of
an
elementary
Frobenioid
[cf.
the
description
of
the
kernel
in
Proposition
4.4,
(iii)]
that
C
is
of
birationally
Frobenius-normalized
type,
hence
also
of
model
type,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iv).

The

the

The

a

of

We
shall
refer
to
C
as
the

deﬁned
by

and
the

[which
we

Moreover,
there

and
the

this

with

if
and
only
if
the

(a)
if

then
C
admits
a
Frobenius-compact

(b)
D
is

C

Suppose
that

C

Then
there

Proof.
Assertions
(i),
(ii)
follow
via
a
routine
veriﬁcation
[which,
in
the
case
of
assertion
(ii),
is
reminiscent
of
the
veriﬁcation
that
“elementary
Frobenioids
are
Frobenioids”
in
Proposition
1.5,
(i)];
in
light
of
assertion
(ii),
assertion
(iii)
follows
formally
from
the
deﬁnitions
[cf.
Deﬁnitions
3.1,
(i);
4.5,
(iii)].
Here,
we
observe
that
the
objects
A
=
(AD
,
α)
such
that
α
=
0
are
Frobenius-trivial,
and
that
these
objects,
together
with
the
morphisms
φ
=
(degFr
(φ),
Base(φ),
Div(φ),
uφ
)
:
A
→
B
such
that
Div(φ)
=
0,
uφ
=
1
[i.e.,
uφ
is
the
identity
element
of
B(A)],
determine
a
base-Frobenius
pair
of
C.
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iv).
We
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
C,
hence
also
C
Fr-tr
,
is
a
skeleton.
Let
(P,
F
)
be
a
base-Frobenius
pair
of
C
[cf.
our
assumption
that
C
is
of
model
type].
Thus,
P
may
be
regarded
as
a
subcategory
of
C
Fr-tr
.
If
C
∈
Ob(C),
then
let
us
refer
to
a(n)[ordered]
pair
of
pre-steps
in
C
(B
→
A,
A
→
C)
such
that
A
∈
Ob(P)
as
an
F
P-path
for
C.
Write
C
for
the
category
C

whose
objects
are
objects
of
C
equipped
with
an
F
P-path,
and
whose
morphisms
are
the
morphisms
between
the
objects
regarded
as
objects
of
C.
Thus,
we
have
a
natural
functor
C

→
C
[obtained
by
forgetting
the
F
P-paths],
102
SHINICHI

which
is
manifestly
an
equivalence
of
categories.
Thus,
it
suﬃces
to
construct
an
∼
equivalence
of

C

→
C
that
is
compatible
with
the
functors
C

→

C
→

.
Next,
observe
that
we
may
apply
Remark
2.7.2
to
C
Fr-tr
[which
is
of
base-trivial
type,
by
Theorem
5.1,
(iii)]
to
conclude
that
every
morphism
φ
of
C
Fr-tr
admits
a
unique
factorization
φ
=
φP
◦
φO×
◦
φF
in
C
Fr-tr
,
where
φP
is
P-distinguished;
φO×
is
a
base-identity
automorphism;
φF
is
F
-distinguished.
Let
us
write
E
⊆
C
birat
for
the
full
subcategory
determined
by
the
image
of
the
objects
in
P.
Then
observe
∼
that
the
category
E
is
also
a
skeleton;
that
the
Frobenioid
E
→
C
birat
is
also
of
isotropic
and
base-trivial
type
[cf.
Proposition
4.8,
(i);
Theorem
5.1,
(iii)];
and
that
(P,
F
)
determine
a
base-Frobenius
pair
of
E.
Thus,
we
may
apply
Remark
2.7.2
to
E
to
conclude
that
every
morphism
ψ
of
E
admits
a
unique
factorization
ψ
=

ψF
in
E,
where
ψP
is
P-distinguished;
ψO×

ψF
is

Now
observe
that
to
every

Ob(C)
equipped
with
an
F
P-path
(ζA

“birat’s”
denote
the

of
C.
Now
in
light
of
the
fact
that
C
is
of
model
—
hence,
in
particular,
birationally
Frobenius-normalized
—
type,
it
is
a
routine
exercise
to
verify
that
these

determine
a
functor

Indeed,
this
is
immediate
for
the
ﬁrst
three
entries
of
the
data
that
deﬁne
a
morphism
of
C;
for
the
ﬁnal
entry,
it
follows
from
the
existence
of
the
unique
factorizations
of
morphisms
of

discussed
above.
Note
that
these
factorizations
also
imply
that

this

essentially
surjective
[cf.
Theorem
5.1,
(i)]
and
full
[cf.
Theorem
5.1,

hence
an
equivalence
of
categories,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iv).

Remark
5.2.1.
It
follows
formally
from
Theorem
5.2,
(ii),
(iv),
that
the
Frobenioid
“C”
of
Example
4.6
constitutes
an
example
of
a
Frobenioid
of
isotropic,
standard,
and
[strictly]
rational
type,
which
is
not
of
group-like
or
model
type.
Proposition
5.3.
(Realiﬁcations
of
Frobenioids)
Suppose
that
Φ
is
perffactorial.
Then
we
shall
refer
to
as
the
realiﬁcation
C
rlf
of
the
Frobenioid
C
the
model
Frobenioid
[cf.
Theorem
5.2,
(ii)]
associated
to
the
divisor
monoid
Φrlf
[i.e.,
the
“realiﬁcation”
of
Deﬁnition
2.4,
(i)]
and
the
rational
function
monoid
R

Φbirat
⊆
(Φrlf

[i.e.,
for
AD
∈
Ob(D),
(R

Φbirat
)(AD
)
is
the
R-vector
subspace
of
(Φrlf
)gp
(AD
)
generated
by
Φbirat
(AD
)].
Moreover,
the
Frobenioid
C
un-tr
(respectively,
(C
un-tr

)
is
of
model
type
and
may
be
obtained
as
the
model
Frobenioid
associated
to
the

Φpf

the
rational

monoid
Φbirat
(respectively,
Q
·
Φbirat
=
Φbirat
⊗Z
Q
=
(Φbirat

).
In
particular,
if
C
is
of
Frobenius-isotropic
type,
then
there
is
a
natural

the

Proof.
Since
Frobenioids

[cf.

the

Before

we
note
the
following
[portions
of
which
were

Proposition
5.5.
(Perfection,
Unit-trivialization
and
Realiﬁcation
of
Types)
Suppose
that
C
is
of
Frobenius-isotropic
and
Frobenius-normalized
type.
Then:
(i)
If
A
∈
Ob(C
istr
)
maps
to
an
object
Apf
∈
Ob(C
pf
),
then
the
natural
functor
∼
C
→
C
pf
determines
a
natural
isomorphism
O
(A)pf
→
O
(Apf
).
(ii)
There
is
a
natural
equivalence
of
categories
[compatible
with
the
functors
to
the
respective
elementary
Frobenioids]
between
(C

)un-tr
and
(C

and
between
(C
pf
)birat
and
(C

)pf
.
(iii)
If
C
is
of
standard
(respectively,
rationally
standard;
model)
type,
then
so
is
C
pf
.
Moreover,
C
un-tr
,
C
rlf
are
always
of
model
type.
Finally,
suppose
further
that
C
is
not
of
group-like
type.
Then
if
C
is
of
standard
(respectively,
rationally
standard)
type,
then
so
are
C
un-tr
,
C
rlf
.
(iv)
If
C
is
the
model
Frobenioid
associated
to
data
Φ,
B,
DivB
:
B

[cf.
Theorem

then
there
is
a
natural
equivalence

[compatible
with
the
functors
to
the
respective
elementary
Frobenioids]
between
C
pf

Proof.
Assertion
(i)
follows
immediately
for
Frobenius-trivial
A
by
considering
base-identity
endomorphisms
of
Frobenius
type
of
A
and
applying
the
hypothesis
that
C
is
of
Frobenius-normalized
type;
the
case
of
arbitrary
A
then
follows
by
considering
“pairs
of
pre-steps”
as
in
Theorem
5.1,
(i)
[cf.
also
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
THE
GEOMETRY
OF
FROBENIOIDS
I
105
(c)].
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
One
checks
immediately
that
[in
light
of
our
hypothesis
that
C
is
of
Frobenius-isotropic
type]
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
C
is
of
isotropic
type.
Then
it
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
the
perfection
[cf.
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(iii)]
that
it
suﬃces
to
obtain
natural
bijections
between
the
respective
sets
of
morphisms
between
the
images
of
two
given
objects
of
C
in
(C
pf
)un-tr
,
(C
un-tr
)pf
(respectively,
(C
pf
)birat
),
(C
birat
)pf
).
But
this
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions,
together
with
Proposition
3.2,
(ii),
applied
to
“pre-steps”
and
“units”
[i.e.,
base-identity
automorphisms].
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
First,
we
observe
that
C
un-tr
,
C
rlf
are
of
model
type
[cf.
Theorem
5.1,
(iv);
Proposition
5.3;
Theorem
5.2,
(ii)],
hence
of
isotropic
and
birationally
Frobenius-normalized
type
[cf.
Deﬁnitions
2.7,
(iii);
4.5,
(i)].
Next,
let
us
observe
that
by
assertion
(ii),
we
∼
∼
have
natural
equivalences
((C
un-tr
)birat
)pf
→
((C
pf
)un-tr
)birat
,
(C
birat
)pf
→
(C
pf
)birat
;
moreover,
since
C
un-tr
is
of
birationally
Frobenius-normalized
type,
it
follows
that
(C
un-tr
)birat
is
of
Frobenius-normalized
type,
so
assertion
(i)
may
be
applied
to
(C
un-tr
)birat
.
In
light
of
these
observations,
assertion
(iii)
for
C
pf
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions
[cf.
also
Proposition
3.2,
(ii),
(iii)]
by
observing
that
C
pf
is
of
isotropic
type,
and
that
by
assertion
(i),
if
C
∗
is
C
or
(C
un-tr
)birat
[or
C
birat
,
when
C
is
of
birationally
Frobenius-normalized
type],
and
A
∈
Ob((C
∗
)istr
),
then
O
(−)
of
the
image
of
A
in
(C
∗
)pf
is
the
perfection
of
O
(A).
Now
suppose
that
C,
hence
also
C
un-tr
,
C
rlf
,
are
not
of
group-like
type.
Since
(C
un-tr
)birat
admits
a
Frobeniuscompact
object,
the
same
is
true
for
(C
rlf
)birat
.
Also,
we
observe

the
pull-back
morphisms
of
C
un-tr
,
C

are
precisely
the
linear
isometries
[cf.
Proposition
1.4,
(ii)].
In
light
of
these
observations,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
if
C
is
of
standard
(respectively,
rationally
standard)
type,
then
so
are

Finally,
assertion

is

from

Proposition

Finally,
we
conclude
the
theory
of
the
present
§5
by
discussing
a
certain
issue
which
is
closely
related
to
the
issue
of
being
of
model
type.
Namely,
instead
of
working
at
the
level
of
the
entire
category
C,
or
C
Fr-tr
,
we
consider
the
issue
of
being
“of
model
type”
at
the
level
of
a
single
Frobenius-trivial
object:
Proposition
5.6.
(Base-Sections

Suppose
that

type.
Let

be
a

whose

natural


AutD
(AD
)
[cf.
Theorem
5.1,
(iii)]
is
the
identity,
and
φ
is
a
homomorphism
of
monoids
—
determined
by
“restricting”
P,
F
to
A,
in
fact,
depends
only
on
the
data
(C,
A),
and,
in
particular,
is
independent
of
the
data
(F
,
P)
—
up
to
conjugation
[as
a
pair!]
by
an
element
of
O×
(A).
We
shall
refer
to
such
a
pair
(σ,

as
a
base-Frobenius
pair
of
A;
when
F
is

only
up
to

with

we
shall
refer
to
such
a
pair
as
a
quasi-base-Frobenius
pair
of
A.

Let

be
another
such
pair,
that
arises
from
a
base-Frobenius
pair
(P

,
F

)
of
C.
Write
def
def
E
⊆
EndC
(A)
for
the
submonoid
of
base-isomorphisms;
φn
=
φ(n)
∈
E,
φn
=
φ
(n)
∈
E,
for
n
∈
N≥1
.
Then
I
claim
that
it
suﬃces
to
show
the
existence
of
a

⊆
E
such
that
u

for

Indeed,
if,
for

we
write

σα

so

=

u

σα

for

—
then
it
follows
from
the

of

F

that,
for

σα

φp
=
φp

σα
;
σα
·
φp
=
φp

—
hence
[since

being
of

type,
is
also
of
[birationally]
Frobenius-normalized
type
—
cf.
Deﬁnition
4.5,

that

(u

=

—
which
[by
the
total
epimorphicity
of
C]
implies
that
vα
=
vαp
,
for
all
p
∈
Primes.
Thus,
by
taking
p
=
2,
we
obtain
that
vα
=
1.
Since
φ,
φ
are
homomorphisms,
and
N≥1
is
generated
by
Primes,
this
completes
the
proof
of
the
claim.
To
verify
the
existence
of
a
u
∈
O×
(A)
as
in
the
above
claim,
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
if
M
⊆
O×
(A)
⊆
E
is
any
subgroup
such
that
for
any
m
∈
M
,
f
∈
E,
there
exists
an
m
∈
M
such
that
f
·
m
=
m
·
f
,
then
there
is
a
natural
monoid
def
structure
on
the
set
of
cosets
EM
=
M
\E
=
{M
·
f
}f
∈E
,
together
with
a
natural
surjection
of
monoids
E

EM
.
For
p
∈
Primes,
let
us
write
Mp
⊆
O×
(A)
for
the
closed
subgroup
topologically
generated
by
the
pro-l
portions
(O×
(A))[l]
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.8,
(ii)]
of
O×
(A),
as
l
ranges
over
the
primes
=
p.
Note
that
since
the
Frobenioid
C
Fr-tr
is
of
Aut-ample
type
[cf.
Theorem
5.1,
(iii)],
it
follows
that
any
f
∈
E
admits
a
factorization
f
=
f0
·
f1
,
where
f0
is
an
automorphism,
and
f1
is
a
base-identity
endomorphism.
Thus,
[by
applying,
again,
the
fact
that
C,
being
of
model
type,
is
also
of
[birationally]
Frobenius-normalized
type
—
cf.
Deﬁnition
4.5,
(i)]
it
follows
that
“for
any
m
∈
Mp
,
there
exists
an
m
∈
Mp
such
THE
GEOMETRY
OF

that
f
·
m
=
m
·
f
”.
In
particular,
it
makes
sense
to
speak
of
the
monoid
EMp
.
Let
p
us
use
the
symbol
“
≈
”
to
denote
the
equality
of
the
images
in
Ep
of
elements
of
E.
Now
since
we
have
a
natural
isomorphism
∼
O×
(A)[p]
→
O×
(A)
p∈Primes
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.8,
(ii)],
it
thus
follows
that
to
prove
the
existence
of
a
u
∈
O×
(A)
as
desired,
it
suﬃces
to
show,
for
each
p
∈
Primes,
the
existence
of
a
up
∈
O×
(A)[p]
p
≈
φl
,
for
all
l
∈
Primes
[i.e.,
we
then
take
u
to
be
the
“inﬁnite
such
that
up

of
the
up
].
p
Now
observe
that
for
each
l
∈
Primes,
φl
≈
vl
·
φl
,
for
some
vl
∈
O×
(A)[p].
p
Since,
for
w
∈
O×
(A)[p],
we
have,
for
l
∈
Primes,
w
·
φl
·
w−1
≈
w1−l
·
φl
[where
we
recall
again
that
C,
being
of
model
type,
is
also
of
[birationally]
Frobenius-normalized
type
—
cf.
Deﬁnition
4.5,

and
O×
(A)[p]
is
a

it
follows
that
there

a

such
that

that

for

On
the
other
hand,
since
φ,

it

that

;
p
φl1

φl2
≈

[for

∈

Thus,
for

we
have
p

—
which
[by
the
total
epimorphicity
of

implies
that

[for
all

Since
O×
(A)[p]
is
a
[topologically
ﬁnitely
generated]
pro-p
group,
we
thus
conclude
p
that
wl
≈
1.

quasi-inverse
to
Ψ
preserve
base-isomorphisms.
Then:
(i)
Ψ
maps
base-sections
(respectively,
quasi-base-Frobenius
pairs)
of
C1
to
base-sections
(respectively,
quasi-base-Frobenius

of

In
particular,
C1
is
of

if
and
only
if
C2

(ii)
C1

of
unit-proﬁnite

if
and
only

(iii)
Suppose
that
C1

Then
Ψ
maps

Suppose,

that
both
Ψ

preserve
Frobenius
degrees.
Then
the
preﬁx
“quasi-”
may
be
removed
from
the
statements
of
(i),
(iii).
Proof.
Indeed,
sorting
through
the
deﬁnitions,
to
verify
assertions
(i),
(ii),
(iii),
(iv)
it
suﬃces
to
show
that

the

be
thought

where
L

If
we
write
V
[L]
for
the
normalization
of
V
in
L
[so
V
[L]
is
also
a
proper

then
let

Observe
that
Φ(L)gp

may
be
identiﬁed
with
the

and
that
Φ(L)pf

Q[DL

[since

that
the

By
assigning
to
a

f
the
divisor
obtained
by
subtracting
the
divisor

of

the
divisor

,
we
obtain
a
natural
homomorphism
B(L)

In

the
assignments

a

Φ

a

Assume
that
the

labeled
by
the

is
equal
to
the
data
labeled
by
the

[so
in
the
following,
we
shall
omit
these

Also,
let
us
suppose
that
k
is
of
positive
characteristic
p.
Then
the
Frobenius
morphism
ψ
:
V
→
V
satisﬁes
the
conditions
of
(i),
hence
determines
a
functor
Ψ:C→C
which
is
isomorphic
to
the
naive
Frobenius
functor
[of
degree
p
on
C]
of
Proposition
2.1.
(iii)
We
maintain
the
assumption
of
(ii)
concerning
indices.
Then
the
Frobenioid
C
is
of
isotropic,
standard,
and
birationally
Frobenius-normalized

of
type,
but
not
of
group-like
type.
If,
moreover,
for
every
ﬁnite
extension
L
⊆
K
K,
and
every
D
∈
DL
,
it
holds
that
D
lies
in
the
support
of
the
image
in
Φ(L)gp
of
an
element
of
B(L),
then
C
is
of
rationally
standard
type.
(iv)
We
maintain
the
assumption
of
(ii)
concerning
indices.
Then
D
is
Frobenius-slim.
Let
Z
⊆
G
be
the
subgroup
of
elements
that
commute
with
some
open
subgroup
of
G.
Then
D
is
slim
if
and
only
if
Z
=
{1};
D
is
Div-slim
[relative
to

Φ]
if
and
only
if,
for
every
1
=
z
∈
Z,
there
exists
a
ﬁnite
Galois
extension
L
⊆
K
of
K
such
that
z
acts
nontrivially
on
Φ(L).
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
Note
that
by
assumptions
(b),
(c)
[in

1
of
K1
the
statement
of
assertion
(i)],
it
follows
that
any
ﬁnite
extension
L1
⊆
K
def

2
of
K2
such
that
[L2
:
K2
]
=
[L1
:
determines
a
ﬁnite
extension
L2
=
L1
·
K2
⊆
K
K1
].
Thus,
ψ
determines
a
functor
D1
→
D2
.
Moreover,
by
assumption
(a)
[in
the
statement
of
assertion
(i)],
it
follows
that
by
pulling
back
[Cartier]
divisors
and
rational
functions
via
ψ,
we
obtain
compatible
natural
transformations
Φ1
→
Φ2
|D1
,
B1
→
B2
|D1
.
Thus,
it
follows
formally
from
the
deﬁnition
of
the
category
underlying
a
model
Frobenioid
in
Theorem
5.2,
(i),
that
we
obtain
a
functor
Ψ
:
C1
→
C2
satisfying
the
properties
stated
in
assertion
(i).
From
this
deﬁnition
of
the
functor
Ψ,
it
then
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
the
“Frobenius
morphism
in
characteristic
p”,
together
with
the
deﬁnition
of
the
“naive
Frobenius
functor”
of
Proposition
2.1
—
i.e.,
in
a
word,
that
both
functors
are
obtained
by
“raising
to
the
p-th
power”
—
that
these
two
functors
are
isomorphic.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertions
(i),
(ii).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
The
fact
that
C
is
of
isotropic
and
birationally
Frobenius-normalized
type
follows
formally
from
Theorem
5.2,
(ii).
The
fact
that
C
is
not
of
group-like
type
is
immediate
from
our
assumption
that
DK
=
∅
[and
the
deﬁnition
of
Φ].
It
is
immediate
that
every
monomorphism
of
D
is
an
isomorphism,
hence
that
D
is
of
FSM-type
[hence
also
of
FSMFF-type
—
cf.
§0].
If
a
K-linear

of
K
induces
an
automorphism
of
Φ(L)
automorphism
α
of
a
ﬁnite
extension
L
⊆
K
112
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
which
preserves
the
primes
of
L,
then
it
is
immediate
from
the
fact
that
α
induces
an
automorphism
of
the
scheme
V
[L]
that
α
maps
every
prime
divisor
D
∈
Φ(L)
to
D
[i.e.,
not
to
some
n
·
D,
where
n
≥
2];
thus,
we
conclude
that
Φ
is
non-dilating,

hence
that
C
is
of
standard
type.
Now
suppose
that
for
every
ﬁnite
extension
L
⊆
K
gp
of
K,
and
every
D
∈
DL
,
it
holds
that
D
lies
in
the
support
of
the
image
in
Φ(L)
of
an
element
of
B(L).
Then
it
follows
formally
[cf.
Deﬁnition
4.5,
(ii)]
that
C
is
of
[strictly]
rational
type
[since
Φ
has
already
been
observed
to
be
perf-factorial
—
cf.
Example
6.1].
Thus,
C
satisﬁes
condition
(a)
of
Deﬁnition
4.5,
(iii).
Now
I
claim
that
every
object
of
(C
un-tr
)birat
is
Frobenius-compact.
Indeed,
if
α
is
a
K-linear

of
K
that
acts
by
multiplication
by
automorphism
of
a
ﬁnite
extension
L
⊆
K
birat
pf
λ
∈
Q>0
on
Φ
(L)
(=
0),
then
since
α
induces
an
automorphism
of
the
variety
V
[L],
it
follows
that
the
order
∈
Q>0
of
the
zero
[or
pole]
of
highest
order
of
an
element
f
∈
Φbirat
(L)pf
is
preserved
by
α,
hence
that
λ
=
1.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
claim,
and
hence
of
the
fact
that
C
is
of
rationally
standard
type.

is
a
ﬁnite
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iv).
First,
we
observe
that
if
L
⊆
K
extension
of
K
that
corresponds
to
an
open
subgroup
H
⊆
G,
then
there
is
a
natural
isomorphism
∼
(Z
⊇)
ZG
(H)
→
Aut(DSpec(L)
→
D)
[cf.
[Mzk7],
Corollary
1.1.6].
Since
G
is
proﬁnite,
hence,
in
particular,
residually
ﬁnite,
it
follows
formally
that
Z,
ZG
(H)
are
also
residually
ﬁnite,
hence
that
D
is
Frobenius-slim,
by
Remark
3.1.2.
Also,
since
Z
is
the
union
of
subgroups
of
G
of
the
form
“ZG
(H)”,
it
follows
formally
that
D
is
slim
if
and
only
if
Z
=
{1},
and
that
D
is
Div-slim
[relative
to
Φ]
if
and
only
if,
for
every
1
=
z
∈
Z,
there
exists

of
K
such
that
z
acts
nontrivially
on
Φ(L
).
This
a
ﬁnite
Galois
extension
L
⊆
K
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iv).

Remark
6.2.1.
Theorem
6.2,
(ii),
constitutes
the
principal
justiﬁcation
for
the
name
“Frobenius
functor”
that
was
applied
to
various
functors
in
§2.
From
this
point
of
view,
the
decomposition
of
the
naive
Frobenius
functor
of
Proposition
2.1
into
“unit-linear”
and
“unit-wise”
Frobenius
functors
[cf.
the
proof
of
Corollary
2.6]
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
the
decomposition
of
the
Frobenius
morphism
in
positive
characteristic
algebraic
geometry
over
a
ﬁxed
base
into
the
composite
of
a
“relative
Frobenius

which
is
linear
over
the
ﬁxed
base,
with
the

morphism
of

Frobenioid

Let
F
be

Write
V(F

for

with
their

OF
for
the

of

of
F
.
If
v
∈
V(F

then
we
shall
write
Fv
for
the
completion
of
F
at
v;
Ov×
⊆

for
the
group
of
units
[i.e.,
elements

Ov

the

Thus,
there

Note,
moreover,
that
Φ,
B,
as
well
as
the
homomorphism

are
functorial
in
the

Thus,
if

Galois
extension
of

G

Gal(F/F

def

then
Φ,
B
determine

and
we
have
a

Moreover,
for
each
ﬁnite

L

one
veriﬁes

that
Φ(L)

that
there

and
that
the

are
precisely
the

Thus,
by
Theorem

(ii),
this
data
determines
a
[model]
Frobenioid

of
isotropic
and
birationally
Frobenius-normalized
type.
Note
that
an

of

may
be
thought
of
as

equipped

If

M
is
an

bundle
on

[where

then
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
a

be
thought
of
as
consisting
of
the

(c)

Also,
we
observe
that

we

observe
that
we

as
follows:
If

so
we

then
the

If
v

nonarchimedean,
then
the

In
light
of

many
readers
might
expect
that
the
next
natural
step
is
to
attempt
to
apply
the
theory
of
Frobenioids
to
study
arithmetic
line
bundles
on
higher-dimensional
arithmetic
varieties.
This
leads,
however,
to
numerous
complications
which
are
beyond
the
scope
of
the

Moreover,
it
is
not
even
clear
to
the

at
the

of

that
this
constitutes
a
natural
direction
in
which
to

ﬁnite

of
F2
is
isomorphic
to
L1
in
a
fashion
that
is
compatible
with
an
isomorphism
F1
∼
=
F2
.
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
We
have
already
seen
in
Example
6.3
that
the
Frobenioid
C
is
of
isotropic
and
birationally
Frobenius-normalized
type,
and
that
Φ
is
nonzero
[so
C
is
not
of
group-like
type]
and
perf-factorial.
As
was
observed
in
the
proof
of
Theorem
6.2,
(iii),
(iv),
D
is
Frobenius-slim
and
of
FSM-type,
hence
also
of
FSMFF-type.
Moreover,
since
any
automorphism
of
a
number
ﬁeld
that
ﬁxes
all
of
the
valuations
of
the
number
ﬁeld
is
clearly
equal
to
the
identity
automorphism,
it
follows
immediately
that
Φ
is
non-dilating,
and
that
D
is
Div-slim
[relative
to
Φ,
hence
also
relative
to
Φpf
,
Φrlf
].
Also,
it
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnition
of
B
that
C
is
of
[strictly]
rational
type,
and
that
every
object
of
(C
un-tr
)birat
is
Frobeniuscompact.
Thus,
we
conclude
that
C
[hence
also
C
pf
,
C
rlf
,
C
un-tr
,
(C
pf
)un-tr
—
cf.
Proposition
5.5,
(iii)]
is
of
rationally
standard
type.
The
proof
of
the
criterion
for
D
to
be
slim
is
entirely
similar
to
the
proof
given
for
Theorem
6.2,
(iv).
Finally,
to
show
that
the
surjection
δA
:
PicΦ
(A)

R
is,
in
fact,
an
isomorphism,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
the
image
of
Φbirat
(L)
⊗Z
R
=
gp
rlf
gp
(L×
)⊗Z
R
in
(Φrlf
factor
)
(L)
is
equal
to
the
set
of
elements
of
(Φfactor
)
(L)
with
ﬁnite
support
whose
image
under
degarith
is
0.
But
this
is
an
immediate
consequence
of
L
the
well-known
Dirichlet
unit
theorem
of
classical
number
theory
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Lang2],
p.
104].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Now
assertion
(ii)
follows
by
observing
that
the
isomorphism
of
groups
∼
PicΦ
(A1
)
→
PicΦ
(A2
)
determined
by
Ψrlf
[cf.
assertion
(i);
Corollary
4.10;
Corollary
4.11,
(iii)]
is
compatible
with
the
“order
structure”
induced
on
both
sides
[via
δA1
,
δA2
]
by
the
“order
116
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
structure”
of
R.
[Indeed,
this
compatibility
follows
from
the
fact
that
the
isomor∼
rlf
phism
in
question
arises
from
an
isomorphism
of
monoids
Φrlf
1
(A1
)
→
Φ2
(A2
).]
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Next,
we
observe
that
assertion
(iii)
follows
formally
from
assertion
(ii),
by
applying
Lemma
6.5,
(ii),
below
in
the
following
fashion:
If
deg(Ψrlf
)
∈
Q>0
,
then
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
there
exist
three
nonarchimedean
valuations
w1
,
w3
,
w5
∈
V(L1
)
lying
over
primes
p1
,
p3
,
p5
∈
Primes,
respectively,
with
the
property
that
w1
→
w2
∈
V(L2
),
w3
→
w4
∈
V(L2
),
w5
→
w6
∈
V(L2
),
where
w2
,
w4
,
w6
lie
over
primes
p2
,
p4
,
p6
∈
Primes,
respectively,
such
that
p1
,
p2
,
p3
,
p4
,
p5
,
p6
are
distinct.
But
this
implies
that
log(p1
)/log(p2
),
log(p3
)/log(p4
),
log(p5
)/log(p6
)
∈
(deg(Ψrlf
))−1
·
Q>0
in
contradiction
to
Lemma
6.5,
(ii).
Thus,
deg(Ψrlf
)
∈
Q>0
.
The
ﬁnal
portion
of
assertion
(iii)
concerning
valuations
of
Q
now
follows
from
Lemma
6.5,
(i).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii).
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iv).
Suppose
that
v1
∈
V(L1
)
maps
to
v2
∈
V(L2
)
[cf.
the
notation
of
the
statement
of
assertion
(iii)].
For
i
=
1,
2,
write
deg(Li
,
vi
)
for
the
number
of
valuations
∈
V(Li
),
including
vi
,
that
lie
over
the
same
valuation
of
Q
as
vi
.
Then
by
Tchebotarev’s
density
theorem
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Lang2],
Chapter
VIII,
§4,
Theorem
10],
it
follows
that
[Li
:
Q]
is
equal
to
the
maximum
of
the
deg(Li
,
vi
),
as
vi
ranges
over
the
elements
of
V(Li
).
Moreover,
if
vi
is
nonarchimedean
and
lies
over
a
prime
pi
∈
V(Li
),
then
pi
splits
completely
in
Li
if
and
only
if
deg(Li
,
vi
)
=
[Li
:
Q].
Thus,
it
follows
that
if
v1
,
v2
lie
over
a
prime
p
∈
Primes
[cf.
assertion
(iii)],
then
[again
by
assertion
(iii)]
p
splits
completely
in
L1
if
and
only
if
p
splits
completely
in
L2
.
If
this
is
the
case,
then
it
follows
that
degarith
maps
a
generator
Li
of
the
monoid
Φi
(Li
)vi
(∼
Z
)
to
log(p).
Thus,
we
conclude
that
deg(Φrlf
)
=
1,
as
=
≥0
desired.
Note
that
this
implies
that
v1
is
of
degree
1
[i.e.,
degarith
maps
a
generator
L1
∼
of
the
monoid
Φ1
(L1
)v1
(=
Z≥0
)
to
log(p)]
if
and
only
if
v2
is
of
degree
1.
Thus,
if
L1
is
Galois
over
Q,
then
whenever
v2
is
of
degree
1,
it
follows
that
v1
is
of
degree
1,
hence
that
p
splits
completely
in
L1
[since
L1
is
Galois
over
Q].
But
this
implies
[again
by
Tchebotarev’s
density
theorem
—
cf.,
e.g.,
[NSW],
Theorem
12.2.5]
that
L1
⊆
L2
,
hence
that
L1
=
L2
[since
we
have
already
seen
that
[L1
:
Q]
=
[L2
:
Q]].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iv).

Proof.
Assertion
(i)
is
a
formal
consequence
of
the
fact
that
Z
is
a

factorization
domain.
Assertion
(ii)
is
a
consequence
of
a
theorem
of
Lang
[cf.
[Lang1];
[Baker],
p.
119]:
Indeed,
since
the
log(pi
)
are
linearly
independent
over
Q
[by
assertion
(i)],
it
follows
that
each
of
the
following
two
sets
of
numbers
is
also
linearly
independent
over
Q:
{log(p2
),
log(p4
),
log(p6
)};
{1,
log(p3
)/log(p4
)}
Moreover,
all
six
products
of
one
element
from
the
ﬁrst
set
and
one
element
from
the
second
set
are
of
the
form
μ
·
log(pi
),
where
μ
∈
Q>0
.
Thus,
the
exponential
of
each
of
these
products
is
algebraic,
in
contradiction
to
Lang’s
theorem.

Appendix:
Slim
Exponentiation
In
the
present
Appendix,
we
discuss
some
elementary
general
nonsense
concerning
slim
categories.
Deﬁnition
A.1.
(i)
A
2-category
of
1-categories
will
be
called
2-slim
[cf.
[Mzk7],
Deﬁnition
1.2.4,
(iii)]
if
every
1-morphism
[i.e.,
functor]
in
the
2-category
has
no
nontrivial
automorphisms.
(ii)
If
D
is
a
2-category
of
1-categories,
then
we
shall
write
|D|
for
the
associated
1-category
whose
objects
are
objects
of
D
and
whose
morphisms
are
isomorphism
classes
of
morphisms
of
D
[cf.
[Mzk7],
Deﬁnition
1.2.4,
(iv)].
We
shall
also
refer
to
|D|
as
the
coarsiﬁcation
of
C.
Remark
A.1.1.
The
name
“coarsiﬁcation”
is
motivated
by
the
theory
of
“coarse
moduli
spaces”
associated
to
(say)
“ﬁne
moduli
stacks”
[cf.
[Mzk7],
Remark
1.2.4.1].
The
following
result
may
be
regarded
as
a
generalization
of
[Mzk7],
Proposition
1.2.5,
(ii)
[a
result
concerning
anabelioids],
to
the
case
of
arbitrary
slim
categories.
Proposition
A.2.
(Slim
Exponentiation)
Let
C
be
a
slim
category
[cf.
§0].
Let
D
be
the
2-category
of
1-categories
deﬁned
as
follows:
The
objects
of
D
are
the
categories
CA
[cf.
§0],
where
A
∈
Ob(A).
The
1-morphisms
of
D
are
the
functors
f!
:
CA
→
CB
[cf.
§0]
induced
by
morphisms
f
:
A
→
B
of
C.
The
2-morphisms
of
D
are
isomorphisms
between
these
functors
[cf.
§0].
Then
D
is
2-slim.
Moreover,
the
functor
E
:
C
→
|D|
A
→
CA
;
f
→
f!
∼
determines
an
equivalence
of
categories
C
→
|D|.
We
shall
refer
to
the
functor
E
as
the
slim
exponentiation
functor.
Proof.
The
fact
that
D
is
2-slim
follows
immediately
from
the
assumption
that
C
is
slim.
Now
it
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
E
is
full
and
essentially
surjective.
To
verify
that
E
is
faithful,
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
given
any
two
morphisms
f,
g
:
A
→
B
of
C,
an
isomorphism
between
the
functors
f!
,
g!
:
CA
→
CB
determines
an
isomorphism
between
the
composites
of
the
functors
f!
,
g!
with
THE
GEOMETRY
OF
FROBENIOIDS
I
119
the
natural
functor
CB
→
C.
On
the
other
hand,
these
two
composite
functors
CA
→
C
both
coincide
with
the
natural
functor
CA
→
C
[i.e.,
that
maps
an
object
∼
C
→
A
of
CA
to
the
object
C
of
C].
Thus,
any
isomorphism
f!
→
g!
determines
an
automorphism
of
the
natural
functor
CA
→
C,
which
[by
the
slimness
of
C!]
is
the
∼
identity
automorphism.
But
this
implies
[by
applying
the
isomorphism
f!
→
g!
to
idA
the
object
A−→A
of
CA
]
that
f
=
g,
as
desired.
