Introduction
The
purpose
of
this
paper
is
to
prove
an
absolute
version
of
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
for
local
p-adic
ﬁelds
(given
as
Theorem
4.2
in
the
text):
Theorem
:
Let
K
and
K

be
ﬁnite
extensions
of
Qp
.
Let
IsomQp
(K,
K

)
denote
the
set
of
Qp
-algebra
isomorphisms
of
K
with
K

.
Let
OutF
ilt
(ΓK
,
ΓK

)
denote
the
set
of
outer
isomorphisms
of
ﬁltered
groups
between
the
absolute
Galois
groups
of
K
and
K

equipped
with
the
ﬁltrations
deﬁned
by
the
higher
(i.e.,
with
index
>
0)
ramiﬁcation
groups
in
the
upper
numbering.
Then
the
natural
morphism
IsomQp
(K,
K
)
→
OutF
ilt
(ΓK
,
ΓK

)
induced
by
“looking
at
the
morphism
induced
on
absolute
Galois
groups”
is
a
bijection.
On
the
one
hand,
one
knows
(cf.
the
Remark
in
[4]
following
Theorem
4.2)
that
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
cannot
hold
in
the
naive
sense
(i.e.,
if
one
removes
the
condition
of
“compatibility
with
the
ﬁltrations”
from
the
outer
isomorphisms
considered
–
see,
e.g.,
[8]),
so
one
must
put
some
sort
of
condition
on
the
outer
isomorphisms
of
Galois
groups
that
one
considers.
The
condition
discussed
here
is
that
they
preserve
the
higher
ramiﬁcation
groups.
One
can
debate
how
natural
a
condition
this
is,
but
at
least
it
gives
some
sort
of
idea
of
how
“good”
an
outer
isomorphism
of
Galois
groups
must
be
in
order
to
arise
“geometrically.”
Historical
Remark:
I
originally
set
out
to
prove
the
naive
version
of
the
above
Theorem,
only
to
discover
that
this
was,
in
fact,
false.
Thus,
I
decided
to
add
the
“preservation
of
ﬁltration”
condition
because
this
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
minimal
natural
condition
that
would
allow
me
to
complete
the
proof
that
I
had
envisaged
(i.e.,
the
proof
discussed
in
this
paper).
Later,
after
submitting
this
paper
for
publication,
I
was
informed,
however,
by
the
referee
that
in
fact,
just
such
a
result
(as
the
above
Theorem)
had
been

conjectured
in
discussions
following
a
talk
at
the
Institute
for
Advanced
Study
in
Princeton
in
the
Fall
of
1993,
and,
moreover,
that
this
conjecture
may
have
existed
in
the
“folklore”
even
earlier
than
this.
At
the
time
I
proved
this
result,
however,
I
was
entirely
unaware
that
this
result
had,
in
fact,
been
conjectured
by
others.
Theorem
4.2
is
proved
by
ﬁrst
showing
that
outer
isomorphisms
of
the
type
considered
necessarily
take
Hodge-Tate
representations
to
Hodge-Tate
representations;
then
one
concludes
by
using
a
well-known
classiﬁcation
result
for
abelian
Hodge-Tate
representations.
Thus,
Theorem
4.2
can
be
regarded
as
an
application
of
p-adic
Hodge
theory.
In
fact,
careful
inspection
will
reveal
that
the
proof
of
Theorem
4.2
runs,
in
many
respects,
in
a
fashion
parallel
to
the
proof
of
the
main
result
of
[7]
(although
it
is,
of
course,
technically
much
simpler
than
the
proof
of
[7]).
The
result
of
this
paper
was
motivated
by
a
question
of
A.
Schmidt
relative
to
the
results
of
[7]:
Namely,
in
[7],
a
relative
Grothendieck
Conjecture-type
result
for
hyperbolic
curves
over
local
p-adic
ﬁelds
was
proven.
The
question
of
A.
Schmidt
was
whether
or
not
such
a
result
could
be
extended
to
an
absolute
Grothendieck
Conjecture-type
result
for
hyperbolic
curves
over
local
p-adic
ﬁelds.
At
the
present
time,
the
author
is
unable
to
prove
such
an
absolute
result,
but
nonetheless,
it
seems
that
a
result
such
as
Theorem
4.2
(whose
proof
belongs
to
the
same
circle
of
ideas
as
the
proof
of
the
main
result
of
[7])
might
be
a
useful
ﬁrst
step
in
this
direction.
Finally,
the
author
would
like
to
thank
A.
Tamagawa
for
useful
discussions
during
which
he
presented
the
proof
of
Theorem
4.2,
as
well
as
A.
Schmidt
for
posing
(via
email)
the
motivational
question
discussed
above.
Section
1:
The
Cyclotomic
Character
and
Inertia
Let
p
be
a
prime
number.
Let
K
be
a
p-adic
local
ﬁeld.
By
this,
we
shall
mean
in
this
paper
that
K
is
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
.
Fix
an
algebraic
closure
K
of
K.
Let
def
ΓK
=
Gal(K/K).
The
purpose
of
this
paper
is
to
examine
to
what
extent
K
can
be
recovered
“group-theoretically”
from
ΓK
.
Here
(and
throughout
the
paper),
when
we
say
that
an
object
associated
to
K
can
be
recovered
“group-theoretically”
from
ΓK
,
we
mean
that
given
another
local
p-adic
ﬁeld
K

,
together
with
an
isomorphism
of
topological
groups
α
:
ΓK
∼
=
ΓK
,
the
object
associated
to
K
is
necessarily
taken
by
α
to
the
corresponding
object
associated
to
K

.
That
is
to
say,
the
use
of
this
term
“group-theoretically”
is
the
same
as
in
[7].
In
this
ﬁrst
Section,
we
observe
that
the
cyclotomic
character
and
the
inertia
subgroup
of
ΓK
can
be
recovered
group-theoretically
from
ΓK
.
It
should
be
remarked
that
the
results
of
this
Section
are
well-known
(see
the
Remark
at
the
end
of
this
Section
for
bibliographical
information).
We
begin
by
reviewing
duality.
Suppose
that
M
is
a
Zp
-module
of
ﬁnite
length
equipped
with
a
continuous
ΓK
-action.
Then
one
knows
(see,
e.g.,
[2],
Proposition
3.8)
that
one
has
a
natural
isomorphism
of
Galois
cohomology
modules
2
H
i
(K,
M
)
∼
=
H
2−i
(K,
M
∨
(1))∨
for
i
≥
0.
Here,
the
“(1)”
is
a
Tate
twist,
and
the
superscripted
“∨”’s
denote
the
“Pontrjagin
dual”
(i.e.,
Hom(−,
Qp
/Zp
)).
Suppose
that
M
is
isomorphic
as
a
Zp
-module
to
Z/pn
Z
(for
some
n
≥
1).
Then
it
follows
from
the
above
isomorphism
that
M
is
isomorphic
as
a
ΓK
-module
to
Z/pn
Z(1)
if
and
only
if
H
2
(K,
M
)
∼
=
Z/pn
Z.
This
is
clearly
a
group-theoretic
condition
on
M
.
Thus,
we
conclude
that
the
isomorphism
class
of
the
ΓK
-module
Zp
(1)
can
be
recovered
group-theoretically
from
ΓK
.
Proposition
1.1:
The
cyclotomic
character
χ
:
ΓK
→
Zp
×
can
be
recovered
entirely
group-theoretically
from
ΓK
.
Now
recall
from
local
class
ﬁeld
theory
(see,
e.g.,
[3])
that
we
have
a
natural
isomorphism
×
∧
∼
Γab
K
=
(K
)
where
the
superscripted
“ab”
denotes
the
abelianization,
and
“(K
×
)∧
”
denotes
the
proﬁnite
completion
of
K
×
=
K
−
{0}.
Let
k
be
the
residue
ﬁeld
of
OK
(the
ring
of
integers
of
K).
Thus,
k
is
the
ﬁeld
of
q
=
pf
elements.
Now
it
is
well-known
that
(K
×
)∧
ﬁts
into
an
exact
sequence
of
topological
groups:

→0
0
→
UK
→
(K
×
)∧
→
Z
×
.
In
particular,
one
thus
sees
that
the
prime-to-p
part
of
the
torsion
where
UK
=
OK
×
∧
subgroup
of
(K
)
has
precisely
q
−
1
elements,
and
that
the
pro-p
quotient
of
(K
×
)∧
is
the
direct
sum
of
a
torsion
group
and
a
free
Zp
-module
of
rank
[K
:
Qp
]
+
1.
(Here
we
use
the
p-adic
logarithm
on
an
open
subgroup
of
UK
to
identify
it
(modulo
torsion)
with
an
open
subgroup
of
K.)
Thus,
it
follows
from
the
above
isomorphism
that
def
Proposition
1.2:
The
number
q
of
elements
in
the
residue
ﬁeld
of
OK
,
and
well
as
the
absolute
degree
[K
:
Qp
]
of
K,
can
be
recovered
entirely
group-theoretically
from
ΓK
.
Now
let
H
⊆
ΓK
be
an
open
subgroup.
Let
L
⊇
K
be
the
extension
ﬁeld
of
K
corresponding
to
H.
By
applying
Proposition
1.2
to
L
and
H,
we
see
that
the
number
qL
of
elements
in
the
residue
ﬁeld
of
OL
can
be
recovered
group-theoretically
from
H
⊆
ΓK
.
Note,
moreover,
that
L
is
unramiﬁed
over
K
if
and
only
qL
=
q
[ΓK
:H]
.
Thus,
we
see
that
we
have
obtained
the
following
Corollary
1.3:
from
ΓK
.
The
inertia
subgroup
IK
⊆
ΓK
can
be
determined
group-theoretically
3
Remark:
It
follows,
in
particular,
from
the
results
of
this
Section
that
(i)
[K
:
Qp
]
and
(ii)
the
maximal
abelian
(over
Qp
)
subﬁeld
of
K
are
determined
group-theoretically
by
ΓK
.
That
(i)
and
(ii)
are
determined
by
ΓK
is
stated
in
[4]
(the
Remark
following
Theorem
4.2),
although
the
proofs
of
these
facts
given
in
the
references
of
[4]
are
somewhat
diﬀerent
both
in
substance
and
in
point
of
view
from
what
we
have
done
in
this
Section.
Moreover,
the
content
of
Propositions
1.1
and
1.2
is
also
essentially
contained
in
[8],
and
Corollary
1.3
is
explicitly
stated
in
§1
of
[9].
Section
2:
Higher
Ramiﬁcation
Groups
Recall
that
the
p-adic
logarithm
deﬁnes
a
natural
isomorphism
of
UK
(modulo
torsion)
onto
an
open
subgroup
of
K.
In
particular,
it
deﬁnes
an
isomorphism
of
UK
⊗Zp
Qp
with
K.
Now,
for
any
ﬁnite
extension
L
of
K
(corresponding
to
some
subgroup
ΓL
⊆
ΓK
),
we
have
a
commutative
diagram
UK
⊗Zp
Qp
⏐
⏐log

K
−→
UL
⊗Zp
Qp
⏐
⏐log

−→
L
(where
the
horizontal
maps
are
the
natural
inclusions).
Moreover,
if
we
regard
UK
(respecab
tively,
UL
)
as
a
subgroup
of
Γab
K
(respectively,
ΓL
)
then
the
morphism
UK
→
UL
may
be
recovered
group-theoretically
by
means
of
the
“Verlagerung,
or
transfer,
map”
(see,
e.g.,
[6],
Chapter
VII,
§8).
We
thus
obtain
the
following
result:
Proposition
2.1:
The
ΓK
-module
K
may
be
recovered
group-theoretically
from
ΓK
.
Note,
however,
that
at
this
point,
the
multiplicative
structure
on
K
(i.e.,
its
structure
as
a
ﬁeld,
as
opposed
to
just
as
an
additive
group
with
ΓK
-action)
has
yet
to
be
recovered
group-theoretically.
Now
let
v
≥
0
be
a
real
number.
Then
we
shall
denote
by
ΓvK
⊆
ΓK
the
higher
ramiﬁcation
group
associated
to
the
number
v
in
the
“upper
numbering”
(see,
e.g.,
[3],
v
⊆
UK
the
subgroup
1
+
mnK
,
where
mK
⊆
OK
is
the
p.
155).
Let
us
denote
by
UK
maximal
ideal,
and
n
is
the
unique
integer
for
which
n
−
1
<
v
≤
n.
Then
it
is
well-known
v
(Theorem
1
of
[3],
p.
155)
that
the
image
of
ΓvK
in
Γab
K
is
equal
to
UK
⊆
UK
.
Let
eK
be
the
absolute
ramiﬁcation
index
of
K
(i.e.,
the
ramiﬁcation
index
of
K
over
Qp
).
Note
that,
by
Proposition
1.2,
it
follows
that
eK
can
be
recovered
group-theoretically
from
ΓK
.
Suppose
that
we
are
given
(in
addition
to
ΓK
)
the
subgroup
ΓvK
⊆
ΓK
for
some
v
=
r
·
eK
,
where
v
r
≥
2
is
an
integer.
Then
it
follows
that
we
know
the
subgroup
UK
⊆
UK
.
Moreover,
it
follows
from
the
theory
of
the
p-adic
logarithm
(see,
e.g.,
[5],
Chapter
IV,
§1)
that
the
submodule
4
v
p−r
·
UK
⊆
UK
⊗Zp
Qp
corresponds
to
the
submodule
OK
⊆
K
under
the
isomorphism
induced
by
the
p-adic
logarithm.
∧
∧
Now
let
us
denote
by
K
the
p-adic
completion
of
the
ﬁeld
K.
Thus,
K
is
the
quotient
ﬁeld
of
the
p-adic
completion
of
the
ring
of
integers
OK
.
Then
we
see
that
we
have
obtained
the
following
result:
Proposition
2.2:
Suppose
that
we
are
given
the
following
group-theoretic
data:
the
topological
group
ΓK
,
together
with
the
indexed
ﬁltration
ΓvK
for
all
v
>
0.
Then
the
∧
ΓK
-modules
OK
,
and
K
can
be
recovered
group-theoretically
from
this
group-theoretic
data.
Proof:
To
obtain
OK
,
we
simply
apply
the
above
discussion
to
ﬁnite
extensions
L
of
K,
and
use
Proposition
2.1.
Note
that
when
we
pass
to
an
open
subgroup
ΓL
⊆
ΓK
,
since
the
upper
numbering
is
not
compatible
with
passage
to
subgroups,
one
must
ﬁrst
convert
to
the
lower
numbering
(which
is
compatible
with
passage
to
subgroups),
and
then
convert
back
to
the
upper
numbering
for
ΓL
.
(See,
e.g.,
[6],
Chapter
IV,
for
more
details
on
the
properties
of
the
upper
and
lower
numberings.)
It
is
for
this
reason
that
we
need
all
the
ΓvK
for
v
>
0
(note
that
we
already
have
Γ0K
=
IK
by
Corollary
1.3),
rather
than
just
ΓvK
for
suﬃciently
large
v.
∧
∧
To
obtain
K
,
we
note
that
K
is
just
the
p-adic
completion
of
OK
tensored
over
Zp
with
Qp
.
Before
proceeding,
it
will
be
convenient
to
formalize
the
hypothesis
of
the
preceding
Proposition.
Let
G
be
a
topological
group.
We
would
like
to
consider
ﬁltrations
Gv
on
G
indexed
by
a
real
number
v,
as
follows:
Deﬁnition
2.3:
We
shall
call
a
collection
of
closed
normal
subgroups
{Gv
}
of
G
(where
v
ranges
over
all
positive
real
numbers)
a
ﬁltration
on
G
if
Gv1
⊆
Gv2
whenever
v1
≥
v2
.
There
are
obvious
notions
of
morphisms
and
isomorphisms
between
ﬁltered
groups,
which
we
leave
to
the
refer
to
formalize.
Moreover,
because
of
the
normality
assumption
on
the
Gv
,
there
is
also
a
notion
of
outer
isomorphisms
(i.e.,
isomorphisms,
considered
modulo
inner
isomorphisms)
between
ﬁltered
groups.
Note
that
ΓK
is
equipped
with
a
natural
ﬁltration
deﬁned
by
the
ΓvK
.
Thus,
Proposition
2.2
may
be
reformulated
as
stating
that
∧
the
ΓK
-module
K
may
be
recovered
group-theoretically
from
the
ﬁltered
group
ΓK
.

Section
3:
Hodge-Tate
Representations
Next,
let
us
observe
the
following
formal
consequence
of
Proposition
2.2:
Let
V
be
a
ﬁnite
dimensional
Qp
-vector
space
equipped
with
a
continuous
action
by
ΓK
.
For
any
∧
integer
i,
let
dV
(i)
be
the
Qp
-dimension
of
the
space
of
ΓK
-invariants
of
V
(−i)⊗Qp
K
.
Let
dV
be
the
sum
of
the
dV
(i)
as
i
ranges
over
all
the
integers.
It
is
well-known
([1],
Chapter
III,
§1.2)
that
dV
≤
dimQp
(V
).
Moreover,
if
dV
=
dimQp
(V
),
then
the
ΓK
-module
V
is
called
Hodge-Tate.
Corollary
3.1:
Given
a
continuous
Qp
[ΓK
]-vector
space
of
ﬁnite
Qp
-dimension,
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
V
is
Hodge-Tate
(as
well
as
the
invariants
dV
(i))
can
be
determined
entirely
group-theoretically
from
the
ﬁltered
group
ΓK
.
We
shall
especially
be
interested
in
the
following
type
of
representation:
Let
E
be
a
ﬁnite
Galois
extension
of
Qp
containing
K.
Let
us
suppose
that
the
ΓK
-module
V
is
equipped
with
an
E-action,
and
that
V
has
dimension
one
over
E.
Thus,
EndE
(V
)
=
E,
and
the
ΓK
action
on
V
is
given
by
some
representation
ρV
:
ΓK
→
E
×
,
which
necessarily
factors
through
Γab
K
.
Now
we
make
the
following
Deﬁnition
3.2:
We
shall
call
the
E[ΓK
]-module
V
uniformizing
if
the
restriction
of
ρV
×
to
some
open
subgroup
I
of
UK
(⊆
Γab
induced
by
restricting
K
)
is
the
morphism
I
→
E
some
morphism
of
ﬁelds
K
→
E
to
I
⊆
UK
⊆
K.
By
class
ﬁeld
theory,
it
follows
immediately
that
uniformizing
V
exist.
Now
one
knows
([1],
Chapter
III,
Appendix,
§5)
that
V
(as
in
the
paragraph
preceding
Deﬁnition
3.2)
is
uniformizing
if
and
only
if
dV
(1)
=
[E
:
K];
dV
(0)
=
[E
:
K]
·
([K
:
Qp
]
−
1).
Thus,
we
obtain
the
following
Corollary
3.3:
Given
a
continuous
E[ΓK
]-module
V
of
E-dimension
1,
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
V
is
uniformizing
can
be
determined
entirely
group-theoretically
from
the
ﬁltered
group
ΓK
.
Section
4:
The
Main
Theorem
Let
K
and
K

be
local
p-adic
ﬁelds.
Let
us
assume
that
we
are
given
an
isomorphism
α
:
ΓK
∼
=
ΓK

of
ﬁltered
groups.
Let
V
be
a
uniformizing
E[ΓK
]-module,
for
some
Galois
extension
E
of
Qp
which
contains
both
K
and
K

.
Note
that
α
allows
us
to
regard
V
also
as
an
E[ΓK

]-module.
Moreover,
by
Corollary
3.3,
it
follows
that
V
is
also
a
uniformizing
6
E[ΓK

]-module.
Thus,
it
follows
that
there
exist
open
submodules
I
⊆
UK
and
I

⊆
UK

such
that
the
isomorphism
UK
∼
=
UK

induced
by
α
maps
I
onto
I

,
and
moreover,
the
resulting
isomorphism
αI
:
I
∼
=
I

ﬁts
into
a
commutative
diagram
I
⏐
⏐

I
−→
α
I
⏐
⏐

E×
idE
×
E×
−→
where
the
vertical
morphisms
are
induced
by
ﬁeld
inclusions
ι
:
K
→
E
and
ι
:
K

→
E.
Since
I
(respectively,
I

),
regarded
as
a
subset
of
UK
⊆
K
(respectively,
UK

⊆
K

),
generates
K
(respectively,
K

)
as
a
Qp
-vector
space
(by
Lemma
4.1
below),
it
thus
follows
that
Im(ι)
=
Im(ι
).
In
other
words,
K
and
K

may
be
realized
as
the
same
subﬁeld
of
E,
i.e.,
the
ﬁeld
inclusions
ι
and
ι
induce
an
isomorphism
of
ﬁelds
αK
:
K
∼
=
K

whose
restriction
to
I
⊆
UK
⊆
K
is
αI
.
Lemma
4.1
:
If
I
⊆
UK
is
an
open
subgroup,
then
the
Qp
-vector
space
generated
by
I
in
K
is
equal
to
K.
Proof:
Let
Z
⊆
K
be
the
Qp
-subspace
of
K
generated
by
I.
Note
that
UK
is
open
in
K
(in
the
p-adic
topology).
Thus,
I
is
open
in
K.
Moreover,
if
z
∈
Z,
then
it
follows
from
def
the
deﬁnition
of
Z
that
z
+
I
=
{z
+
i
|
i
∈
I}
is
also
contained
in
Z.
On
the
other
hand,
z
+
I
is
open
in
K.
Thus,
it
follows
that
Z
is
open
in
K.
On
the
other
hand,
if
Z
=
K,
then
(since
the
p-adic
topology
on
Qp
is
not
discrete),
it
would
follow
that
Z
is
not
open
in
K.
This
contradiction
shows
that
Z
=
K,
thus
completing
the
proof
of
the
Lemma.
In
other
words,
we
have
proven
the
following
result:
Theorem
4.2:
Let
K
and
K

be
ﬁnite
extensions
of
Qp
.
Let
IsomQp
(K,
K

)
denote
the
set
of
Qp
-algebra
isomorphisms
of
K
with
K

.
Let
OutF
ilt
(ΓK
,
ΓK

)
denote
the
set
of
outer
isomorphisms
of
ﬁltered
groups
between
the
absolute
Galois
groups
of
K
and
K

equipped
with
the
ﬁltrations
deﬁned
by
the
higher
(i.e.,
with
index
>
0)
ramiﬁcation
groups
in
the
upper
numbering.
Then
the
natural
morphism
IsomQp
(K,
K
)
→
OutF
ilt
(ΓK
,
ΓK

)
induced
by
“looking
at
the
morphism
induced
on
absolute
Galois
groups”
is
a
bijection.
Proof:
That
this
morphism
is
injective
follows
by
looking
at
the
induced
isomorphism
×
∧
ab
∼

×
∧
∼
between
Γab
K
=
(K
)
and
ΓK

=
((K
)
)
.
(Alternatively,
the
more
group-theoretically
oriented
reader
may
prefer
to
regard
the
injectivity
of
this
morphism
as
a
consequence
of
7
the
fact
that
the
centralizer
of
ΓK
in
ΓQp
is
trivial.)
Now
let
us
show
that
the
morphism
is
surjective.
Let
α
:
ΓK
∼
=
ΓK

be
an
isomorphism
that
is
compatible
with
the
ﬁltrations.
Then,
in
the
preceding
paragraph,
we
constructed
a
ﬁeld
isomorphism
αK
:
K
∼
=
K

.
To
see
that
the
morphism
induced
by
αK
is
equal
to
the
original
α
(up
to
composition
with
an
inner
isomorphism),
it
suﬃces
simply
to
construct
the
analogues
αL
:
L
∼
=
L
of
αK
for


corresponding
ﬁnite
extensions
L
and
L
of
K
and
K
,
and
then
conclude
via
a
standard
general
nonsense
argument.
Remark
Concerning
the
Motivation
for
Theorem
4.2:
Let
XK
be
a
closed
hyperbolic
curve
over
K
(as
in
[7]).
Let
ΠX
be
the
absolute
fundamental
group
of
XK
.
Thus,
ΠX
ﬁts
into
an
exact
sequence
of
topological
groups
1
→
ΔX
→
ΠX
→
ΓK
→
1
where
ΔX
⊆
ΠX
is
the
geometric
fundamental
group
of
XK
(i.e.,
the
fundamental
group
of
XK
⊗K
K).
The
main
result
of
[7]
implies
that
XK
can
be
functorially
reconstructed
from
the
morphism
ΠX
→
ΓK
.
The
question
of
A.
Schmidt
referred
to
in
Section
0
was
whether
or
not
XK
can,
in
fact,
be
reconstructed
from
ΠX
alone.
At
the
present
time,
the
author
has
not
succeeded
in
doing
this,
but
nevertheless,
one
can
make
the
following
observations.
First
of
all,
by
an
argument
similar
to
that
of
Proposition
1.1
(using
Poincaré
duality),
one
can
at
least
reconstruct
the
cyclotomic
character
ΠX
→
ΓK
→
Zp
×
group-theoretically.
Once
one
has
the
cyclotomic
character,
one
can
use
it
to
consider
H
1
(ΠX
,
Zp
(1)),
which
is
surjected
onto
by
H
1
(ΓK
,
Zp
(1)).
This
allows
one
to
reconstruct
the
quotient
ΠX
→
ΠX
/ΔX
group-theoretically.
What
is
still
missing
at
this
point,
however,
is
an
argument
that
would
allow
one
to
reconstruct
(grouptheoretically)
the
isomorphism
ΠX
/ΔX
∼
=
ΓK
induced
by
the
natural
morphism
ΠX
→
ΓK
.
At
the
time
of
writing,
the
author
does
not
see
how
to
do
this.
Furthermore,
the
argument
just
discussed
for
reconstructing
the
cyclotomic
character
group-theoretically
breaks
down
in
the
case
when
the
curve
XK
is
aﬃne.
Thus,
at
any
rate,
it
seems
that
in
order
to
prove
an
“absolute
Grothendieck
Conjecture-type
result
for
hyperbolic
curves
over
local
ﬁelds,”
some
fundamentally
new
ideas
are
needed.
It
is
hoped
that
Theorem
4.2
could
serve
as
a
ﬁrst
step
in
this
direction.
