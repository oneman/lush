We
begin
our
discussion
by
posing
the
following
elementary
problem
concerning
algebraic
varieties
over
the
complex
numbers
(where,
roughly
speaking,
an
“algebraic
variety
over
the
complex
numbers”
is
a
geometric
object
deﬁned
by
polynomial
equations
with
coeﬃcients
which
are
complex
numbers):
Problem:
Given
an
algebraic
variety
Z
over
C,
it
is
possible
to
give
some
sort
of
natural
explicit
catalogue
of
the
rational
points
Z(C)
of
Z?
1
To
gain
a
sense
of
what
is
meant
by
the
expression
“a
natural
explicit
catalogue,”
it
is
useful
to
begin
by
thinking
about
some
basic
examples.
Perhaps
the
simplest
nontrivial
examples
of
algebraic
varieties
are
plane
curves,
i.e.,
subvarieties
of
A2C
(two-dimensional
aﬃne
space
over
C)
deﬁned
by
a
single
polynomial
equation
f
(X,
Y
)
=
0
in
two
variables.
In
this
case,
the
set
of
rational
points
Z(C)
of
the
corresponding
variety
Z
is
given
by
Z(C)
=
{(x,
y)
∈
C2
|
f
(x,
y)
=
0}
Moreover,
we
can
classify
plane
curves
by
the
degree
of
the
deﬁning
equation
f
(X,
Y
).
We
then
see
that
the
resulting
sets
Z(C)
may
be
explicitly
described
as
follows:
(1.)
The
Linear
Case
(deg(f
)
=
1):
Up
to
coordinate
transformations,
this
is
the
case
given
by
the
equation
f
(X,
Y
)
=
X.
In
this
case,
we
then
obtain
an
explicit
catalogue
of
the
rational
points
by:
∼
(0,
?)
:
C
→
Z(C)
(i.e.,
mapping
z
∈
C
to
(0,
z)
∈
Z(C)).
(2.)
The
Quadratic
Case
(deg(f
)
=
2):
Up
to
coordinate
transformations
(and
ruling
out
degenerate
cases),
we
see
that
this
is
essentially
the
case
where
the
equation
f
(X,
Y
)
=
X
·Y
−
1.
In
this
case,
an
explicit
catalogue
is
given
by
the
exponential
map:
exp
:
C
→
Z(C)
=
C×
(In
fact,
the
map
may
be
deﬁned
intrinsically,
without
using
coordinate
transformations
to
render
the
deﬁning
equation
in
the
“standard
form”
X
·
Y
=
1.)
(3.)
The
Cubic
Case
(deg(f
)
=
3):
Up
to
adding
the
point(s)
at
inﬁnity,
this
is
essentially
the
case
where
we
are
dealing
with
an
elliptic
curve
E.
In
this
case,
as
well,
we
have
a
natural
exponential
map:
expE
:
TE
→
E(C)
(where
TE
is
the
one-dimensional
complex
vector
space
given
by
the
tangent
space
to
some
ﬁxed
point
–
“the
origin”
–
of
E).
This
map
allows
us
to
think
of
E
as
being
of
the
form
“C/Λ”
(where
Λ
∼
=
Z2
is
a
lattice
in
C).
2
(4.)
Higher
Degree:
If
deg(f
)
≥
4,
or
we
wish
to
consider
lower
degree
cases
with
lots
of
points
removed,
then
we
are
led
naturally
to
the
following
notion:
A
hyperbolic
curve
Z
is
a
smooth,
proper
connected
algebraic
curve
of
genus
g
with
r
points
removed,
where
we
assume
that
2g
−
2
+
r
>
0.
According
to
the
uniformization
theorem
of
Köbe,
hyperbolic
curves
may
be
unidef
formized
by
the
upper
half-plane
H
=
{z
∈
C
|
Im(z)
>
0},
i.e.,
we
have
a
surjective
(holomorphic)
covering
map:
H
→
Z(C)
which
allows
us
to
think
of
Z(C)
as
being
of
the
form
H/Γ,
where
Γ
is
some
discrete
group
acting
on
H.

“Intrinsic”
Hodge
Theories
In
the
preceding
section,
we
posed
the
problem
of
explicitly
cataloguing
the
rational
points
of
a
variety
(over
C).
By
looking
at
various
examples,
we
saw
that
this
problem
may
also
be
worded
–
in
perhaps
more
familiar
terms
–
as
the
problem
of
ﬁnding
natural
uniformizations
of
varieties.
In
the
present
section,
we
would
like
to
further
reﬁne
our
understanding
of
the
problem
of
ﬁnding
natural
uniformizations/explicit
catalogues
of
rational
points
by
rewording
this
problem
in
terms
of
the
language
of
“Hodge
theory.”
First,
let
us
discuss
what
we
mean
in
general
by
the
notion
of
a
“Hodge
theory.”
By
a
Hodge
theory,
we
shall
mean
an
equivalence
of
the
following
form:
⎛
⎛
⎞
algebraic
⎜
geometry
⎟
⎜
⎟
⎜
(e.g.,
⎟
⎝
⎠
rational
points)
⇐⇒
⎜
⎜
⎜
⎜
⎜
⎝
Over
C:
topology
+
diﬀerential
geometry
Over
the
p-adics:
pro-p
étale
topology
+
Galois
action
⎞
⎟
⎟
⎟
⎟
⎟
⎠
The
most
familiar
example
of
such
an
equivalence
is
the
Hodge
theory
of
cohomologies.
Over
C,
this
amounts
to
“classical
Hodge
theory,”
i.e.,
the
well-known
isomorphism
between
the
de
Rham
cohomology
of
an
algebraic
variety
(which
is
well-known
to
be
an
algebro-geometric
invariant
of
the
variety)
and
the
singular
cohomology
of
the
variety
(which
is
a
topological
invariant).
More
recently,
the
p-adic
Hodge
theory
of
cohomologies
has
been
developed
by
Fontaine
et
al.
(cf.,
e.g.,
[Falt2,3]).
This
theory
asserts
an
3
equivalence
between
the
(algebraic)
de
Rham
cohomology
of
an
algebraic
variety
over
a
ﬁnite
extension
K
of
Qp
and
the
p-adic
étale
cohomology
of
the
variety,
equipped
with
its
natural
Galois
action
(i.e.,
action
of
Gal(K)).
This
“Hodge
theory
of
cohomologies”
is
the
most
basic
example
of
a
“Hodge
theory”
as
deﬁned
above.
In
the
present
manuscript,
however,
we
would
like
to
consider
a
diﬀerent
kind
of
Hodge
theory
which
we
shall
call
an
intrinsic
Hodge
theory,
or
IHT,
for
short.
By
an
intrinsic
Hodge
theory,
we
mean
a
Hodge
theory
–
i.e.,
an
equivalence
of
the
form
discussed
above
–
in
which
the
invariant
which
appears
on
the
“algebraic
geometry”
side
is
the
“variety
itself.”
There
are
several
diﬀerent
ways
to
interpret
the
phrase
“the
variety
itself.”
In
the
present
manuscript,
we
shall
consider
the
following
two
interpretations:
(1.)
The
Physical
Interpretation:
In
this
interpretation,
one
takes
the
phrase
the
“variety
itself”
to
mean
the
“rational
points
of
the
variety.”
(2.)
The
Modular
Interpretation:
In
this
interpretation,
one
takes
the
phrase
the
“variety
itself”
to
mean
the
“moduli
of
the
variety.”
Note
that
(it
is
a
tautology
of
terminology
that)
a
physical
IHT
essentially
amounts
to
some
sort
of
explicit
description
of
the
rational
points
of
the
variety
in
terms
of
topology
and
geometry.
Thus,
one
may
summarize
the
above
discussion
as
follows:
physical
IHT
=
uniformization
of
the
variety
modular
IHT
=
uniformization
of
the
moduli
space
of
deformations
of
the
variety
Before
concluding
this
section,
we
make
some
remarks
on
the
relationship
between
the
“IHT’s”
that
we
wish
to
discuss
here
and
the
more
well-known
“Hodge
theories
of
cohomologies.”
First
of
all,
although
in
general,
IHT’s
are
not
the
same
as
Hodge
theories
of
cohomologies,
typically
in
proving
theorems
which
realize
IHT’s,
the
technical
tools
of
the
corresponding
Hodge
theory
of
cohomologies
(e.g.,
in
the
p-adic
case,
the
techniques
of
so-called
“p-adic
Hodge
theory”
as
in
[Falt2])
play
an
important
role.
Secondly,
in
the
case
of
Gm
=
V
(X
·
Y
−
1)
(i.e.,
Example
(2)
in
§1,
(A.)),
as
well
as
in
the
case
of
elliptic
curves
(i.e.,
Example
(3)
in
§1,
(A.)),
it
just
so
happens
that
the
ﬁrst
cohomology
module
of
the
curve
“is”
the
curve
itself,
i.e.,
in
more
sophisticated
language,
in
these
cases
the
curve
in
question
is
a
1-motive.
Thus,
in
these
cases,
it
turns
out
that
the
notions
of
IHT
and
Hodge
theory
of
H
1
coincide.
In
particular,
in
these
cases,
the
well-known
Hodge
theory
of
H
1
already
provides
a
uniformization
of
the
curve.
Note
that
this
diﬀers
quite
substantially
from
the
case
of
higher
genus
(Example
(4)
in
§1,
(A.)).

Completion
at
Arithmetic
Primes
So
far
in
our
discussion,
we
have
ignored
the
important
issue
of
what
sort
of
ground
ﬁeld
should
be
considered
in
our
discussion
of
uniformizations/explicit
catalogues
of
rational
points/IHT’s.
In
the
examples
of
§1,
(A.),
we
considered
the
situation
over
the
complex
number
ﬁeld,
since
this
is
the
most
elementary
and
well-known
example
of
a
ground
ﬁeld
over
which
IHT’s
may
be
realized.
Of
course,
ideally,
one
would
like
to
realize
IHT’s
over
any
ﬁeld,
for
instance,
over
a
number
ﬁeld
(i.e.,
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Q)
–
a
case
for
which
the
problem
of
determining
the
set
of
rational
points
explicitly
is
of
prime
interest.
Unfortunately,
however,
typically,
in
order
to
realize
an
IHT
(or,
indeed,
any
sort
of
“Hodge
theory”),
one
must
work
over
a
base
which
is
complete
with
respect
to
some
sort
of
“arithmetic
prime.”
The
three
main
examples
of
this
sort
of
base
are
the
following:
(i.)
the
complex
number
ﬁeld
C
(this
also
covers
the
case
of
R
by
working
with
objects
over
C
equipped
with
an
action
of
complex
conjugation,
i.e.,
of
Gal(C/R))
(ii.)
a
p-adic
ﬁeld
K
(i.e.,
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
)
(iii.)
power
series
over
Z
–
typically
arising
as
the
completion
of
some
sort
of
moduli
space
at
a
Z-valued
point
corresponding
to
a
degenerate
object
parametrized
by
the
moduli
space.
Indeed,
all
completions
of
number
ﬁelds
fall
under
cases
(i.)
and
(ii.).
Thus,
if
one
is
ultimately
interested
in
rational
points
of
number
ﬁelds,
IHT’s
over
bases
as
in
(i.)
and
(ii.)
are
of
natural
interest.
Also,
since
the
coeﬃcients
of
the
powers
series
appearing
in
(iii.)
are
integers,
case
(iii.)
is
also
of
substantial
arithmetic
interest.
In
the
following
discussion,
the
following
principle
will
serve
as
an
important
guide:
Guiding
Principle:
For
every
type
of
arithmetic
prime
(i.e.,
cases
(i.),
(ii.),
and
(iii.)
above),
one
expects
that
there
should
be
a
canonical
uniformization
theory
at
that
prime.
In
general,
however,
one
does
not
expect
that
the
canonical
uniformization
theories
at
diﬀerent
primes
should
be
compatible
with
one
another.
We
will
return
to
this
point
in
more
detail
later.
In
terms
of
types
of
varieties,
the
main
cases
in
which
one
has
well-developed
physical
and
modular
IHT’s
are
the
following:
(1.)
abelian
varieties
(2.)
hyperbolic
curves.
The
physical
and
modular
IHT’s
in
these
cases
may
be
roughly
summarized
in
the
following
charts:

(p-adic
Teichmüller
theory)
Of
these
two
examples,
undoubtedly
the
example
of
abelian
varieties
is
the
more
well-known.
Over
C,
the
exponential
map
of
an
abelian
variety
gives
a
uniformization
of
the
abelian
variety
by
a
complex
linear
space.
This
generalizes
Example
(3)
of
§1,
(A.).
Moreover,
by
using
the
periods
that
one
obtains
from
this
uniformization,
one
obtains
a
uniformization
of
the
moduli
space
of
abelian
varieties
by
the
Siegel
upper
half-plane.
Thus,
we
see
both
the
physical
and
modular
aspects
of
the
IHT
of
abelian
varieties
in
evidence.
In
the
p-adic
case,
the
IHT
of
an
abelian
variety
essentially
amounts
to
the
p-adic
Hodge
theory
of
H
1
of
the
abelian
variety.
Although
the
p-adic
Hodge
theory
of
H
1
of
an
abelian
variety
has
many
diﬀerent
aspects,
most
of
these
may
be
traced
to
the
fundamental
paper
of
Tate
([Tate])
in
the
late
1960’s.
In
this
paper,
the
main
theorem
(“Tate’s
theorem”
in
the
chart)
states
that
homomorphisms
between
formal
groups
(e.g.,
the
formal
groups
arising
from
abelian
varieties)
over
p-adic
ﬁelds
are
essentially
equivalent
to
homomorphisms
between
the
corresponding
Tate
modules.
In
some
sense,
this
result
is
the
analogue
for
abelian
varieties
of
the
main
theorem
(Theorem
1)
of
§2
below,
and
may
be
regarded
as
a
sort
of
physical
IHT
for
abelian
varieties.
On
the
other
hand,
the
modular
aspect
of
the
IHT
of
abelian
varieties
may
be
seen
most
easily
in
Serre-Tate
theory,
which
gives
rise
to
p-adic
parameters
on
the
moduli
space
of
abelian
varieties
that
are
very
much
analogous
to
the
Siegel
upper
half-plane
uniformization
in
the
complex
case.
Finally,
in
a
neighborhood
of
a
point
in
the
moduli
space
corresponding
to
a
degenerating
abelian
variety,
one
has
the
theory
of
Tate
curves,
generalized
by
Mumford
and
Faltings/Chai
([FC]).
Moreover,
it
turns
out
that
in
the
case
of
abelian
varieties,
the
complex,
p-adic,
and
degenerating
object
theories
are
all
compatible
with
one
another.
For
instance,
if
one
specializes
the
uniformizing
parameters
that
one
obtains
on
the
moduli
6
space
in
a
neighborhood
of
a
point
corresponding
to
a
degenerating
abelian
variety
to
a
padic
(respectively,
complex)
base,
one
obtains
parameters
compatible
with
the
Serre-Tate
parameters
(respectively,
the
Siegel
upper
half-plane
uniformization).
Next,
we
consider
the
case
of
hyperbolic
curves.
Over
C,
the
physical
aspect
of
the
IHT
of
hyperbolic
curves
(cf.
Example
(4)
of
§1,
(A.))
essentially
amounts
to
the
Fuchsian
uniformization.
Then
just
as
the
exponential
map
uniformization
of
an
abelian
variety
“induces”
the
Siegel
upper
half-plane
uniformization
of
the
moduli
space
of
abelian
varieties,
the
Fuchsian
uniformization
of
a
hyperbolic
curve
“induces”
the
Bers
uniformization
of
the
moduli
space
of
hyperbolic
curves
(cf.
§3,
(A.)
below,
as
well
as
the
Introduction
of
[Mzk4]).
In
a
neighborhood
of
a
point
in
the
moduli
space
corresponding
to
a
totally
degenerate
(proper)
hyperbolic
curve,
one
has
the
theory
of
[Mumf].
Note,
however,
that
this
theory
is
not
compatible
with
the
theory
of
the
Fuchsian
uniformization
in
the
following
sense:
If
one
specializes
the
(Z-coeﬃcient)
power
series
in
the
base
ring
to
some
C-valued
point
in
a
neighborhood
of
a
point
in
the
moduli
space
corresponding
to
a
totally
degenerate
curve,
the
resulting
uniformization
over
C
that
one
obtains
is
the
so-called
Schottky
uniformization
of
the
curve.
This
uniformization
is
completely
diﬀerent
from
the
Fuchsian
uniformization.
Finally,
we
come
to
the
p-adic
case.
It
seems
that
the
IHT
of
p-adic
hyperbolic
curves
has
not
been
studied
extensively
until
relatively
recently
([Mzk1-5]).
Thus,
It
is
the
goal
of
this
manuscript
to
report
on
recent
developments
concerning
the
intrinsic
Hodge
theory
(IHT)
of
p-adic
hyperbolic
curves.
The
physical
aspect,
which
concerns
a
theorem
(Theorem
1)
that
gives
a
strong
solution
to
Grothendieck’s
anabelian
conjecture,
will
be
the
topic
of
§2.
The
modular
aspect,
which
concerns
a
theory
–
which
we
call
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
–
which
may
be
regarded
as
either
the
hyperbolic
curve
analogue
of
Serre-Tate
theory
or
the
p-adic
analogue
of
the
theory
of
the
Fuchsian
and
Bers
uniformizations,
will
be
discussed
in
§3.
We
remark
here
that
this
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
is
not
compatible
with
the
specialization
of
the
theory
of
[Mumf]
to
the
p-adic
case.
This
may
disappoint
some
readers,
but
is,
in
fact,
natural
in
view
of
the
fact
that
even
over
C,
the
specialization
of
the
theory
of
[Mumf]
to
the
complex
numbers
is
not
compatible
(as
remarked
above)
with
the
theory
of
the
Fuchsian
uniformization.
Moreover,
it
is
in
line
with
the
general
Guiding
Principle
discussed
above
that
to
each
sort
of
arithmetic
prime
there
should
correspond
a
natural
uniformization
theory
of
hyperbolic
curves.
Thus,
it
seems
to
the
author
that
it
is
meaningless
to
argue
as
to
whether
it
is
the
specialization
of
the
[Mumf]
to
the
p-adic
case
or
the
theory
of
[Mzk1-4]
which
is
the
“true”
p-adic
analogue
of
the
Fuchsian
uniformization.
That
is
to
say,
it
seems
more
natural
to
the
author
to
regard
the
theory
of
[Mumf]
as
the
“true”
analogue
of
the
Fuchsian
uniformization
at
the
“degenerating
object
prime,”
and
the
theory
of
[Mzk1-4]
as
the
“true”
analogue
of
the
Fuchsian
uniformization
at
“the
prime
p.”
