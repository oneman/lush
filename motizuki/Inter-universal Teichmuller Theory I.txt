INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY I:
CONSTRUCTION OF HODGE THEATERS

Abstract.
The present paper is the ﬁrst in a series of four papers, the
goal of which is to establish an arithmetic version of Teichmüller theory for number
ﬁelds equipped with an elliptic curve — which we refer to as “inter-universal
Teichmüller theory” — by applying the theory of semi-graphs of anabelioids,
Frobenioids, the étale theta function, and log-shells developed in earlier papers by
the author. We begin by ﬁxing what we call “initial Θ-data”, which consists of
an elliptic curve EF over a number ﬁeld F , and a prime number l ≥ 5, as well as
some other technical data satisfying certain technical properties. This data determines various hyperbolic orbicurves that are related via ﬁnite étale coverings to the
once-punctured elliptic curve XF determined by EF . These ﬁnite étale coverings
admit various symmetry properties arising from the additive and multiplicative
structures on the ring Fl = Z/lZ acting on the l-torsion points of the elliptic curve.
We then construct “Θ±ell NF-Hodge theaters” associated to the given Θ-data. These
Θ±ell NF-Hodge theaters may be thought of as miniature models of conventional
scheme theory in which the two underlying combinatorial dimensions of a
number ﬁeld — which may be thought of as corresponding to the additive and
multiplicative structures of a ring or, alternatively, to the group of units and
value group of a local ﬁeld associated to the number ﬁeld — are, in some sense,
“dismantled” or “disentangled” from one another. All Θ±ell NF-Hodge theaters
are isomorphic to one another, but may also be related to one another by means of a
“Θ-link”, which relates certain Frobenioid-theoretic portions of one Θ±ell NF-Hodge
theater to another in a fashion that is not compatible with the respective conventional ring/scheme theory structures. In particular, it is a highly nontrivial
problem to relate the ring structures on either side of the Θ-link to one another. This
will be achieved, up to certain “relatively mild indeterminacies”, in future papers
in the series by applying the absolute anabelian geometry developed in earlier
papers by the author. The resulting description of an “alien ring structure” [associated, say, to the domain of the Θ-link] in terms of a given ring structure [associated,
say, to the codomain of the Θ-link] will be applied in the ﬁnal paper of the series to
obtain results in diophantine geometry. Finally, we discuss certain technical results
concerning proﬁnite conjugates of decomposition and inertia groups in the tempered fundamental group of a p-adic hyperbolic curve that will be of use in the
development of the theory of the present series of papers, but are also of independent
interest.

§I1. Summary of Main Results
The present paper is the ﬁrst in a series of four papers, the goal of which is
to establish an arithmetic version of Teichmüller theory for number ﬁelds
equipped with an elliptic curve, by applying the theory of semi-graphs of anabelioids, Frobenioids, the étale theta function, and log-shells developed in [SemiAnbd],
[FrdI], [FrdII], [EtTh], and [AbsTopIII] [cf., especially, [EtTh] and [AbsTopIII]].
Unlike many mathematical papers, which are devoted to verifying properties of
mathematical objects that are either well-known or easily constructed from wellknown mathematical objects, in the present series of papers, most of our eﬀorts
will be devoted to constructing new mathematical objects. It is only in the ﬁnal
portion of the third paper in the series, i.e., [IUTchIII], that we turn to the task of
proving properties of interest concerning the mathematical objects constructed. In
the fourth paper of the series, i.e., [IUTchIV], we show that these properties may
be combined with certain elementary computations to obtain diophantine results
concerning elliptic curves over number ﬁelds.
We refer to §0 below for more on the notations and conventions applied in the
present series of papers. The starting point of our constructions is a collection of
initial Θ-data [cf. Deﬁnition 3.1]. Roughly speaking, this data consists, essentially,
of
· an elliptic curve EF over a number ﬁeld F ,
· an algebraic closure F of F ,
· a prime number l ≥ 5,
· a collection of valuations V of a certain subﬁeld K ⊆ F , and
· a collection of valuations Vbad
mod of a certain subﬁeld Fmod ⊆ F
that satisfy certain technical conditions — we refer to Deﬁnition 3.1 for more details.
Here, we write Fmod ⊆ F for the ﬁeld of moduli of EF , K ⊆ F for the extension ﬁeld
of F determined by the l-torsion points of EF , XF ⊆ EF for the once-punctured
elliptic curve obtained by removing the origin from EF , and XF → CF for the
hyperbolic orbicurve obtained by forming the stack-theoretic quotient of XF by the

natural action of {±1}. Then F is assumed to be Galois over Fmod , Gal(K/F )
is assumed to be isomorphic to a subgroup of GL2 (Fl ) that contains SL2 (Fl ), EF
is assumed to have stable reduction at all of the nonarchimedean valuations of F ,
def
CK = CF ×F K is assumed to be a K-core [cf. [CanLift], Remark 2.1.1], V
is assumed to be a collection of valuations of K such that the natural inclusion
∼
Fmod ⊆ F ⊆ K induces a bijection V → Vmod between V and the set Vmod of all
valuations of the number ﬁeld Fmod , and
Vbad
mod ⊆ Vmod
is assumed to be some nonempty set of nonarchimedean valuations of odd residue
characteristic over which EF has bad [i.e., multiplicative] reduction — i.e., roughly
speaking, the subset of the set of valuations where EF has bad multiplicative reduction that will be “of interest” to us in the context of the theory of the present series

of papers. Then we shall write Vbad = Vbad

def

Vgood = V\Vbad . Also, we shall apply the superscripts “non” and “arc” to V, Vmod
to denote the subsets of nonarchimedean and archimedean valuations, respectively.
This data determines, up to K-isomorphism [cf. Remark 3.1.3], a ﬁnite étale
covering C K → CK of degree l such that the base-changed covering

torsion points of EK (K) [where we write EK = EF ×F K] which, at v ∈ Vbad ,
restricts to the quotient arising from coverings of the dual graph of the special ﬁber.
Moreover, the above data also determines a cusp

[i.e., the generator determined by the unique loop of the dual graph of the special

[cf. the discussion at the beginning of §4; Deﬁnitions 6.1, 6.4] will play an important
role in the discussion to follow. The natural action of the stabilizer in Gal(K/F ) of
the quotient EK [l]  Q on Q determines a natural poly-action of F
l on C K , i.e.,

a natural isomorphism of Fl with some subquotient of Aut(C K ) [cf. Example 4.3,

(iv)]. The F
l -symmetry constituted by this poly-action of Fl may be thought
of as being essentially arithmetic in nature, in the sense that the subquotient of
Aut(C K ) that gives rise to this poly-action of F
l is induced, via the natural map
Aut(C K ) → Aut(K), by a subquotient of Gal(K/F ) ⊆ Aut(K). In a similar vein,
the natural action of the automorphisms of the scheme X K on the cusps of X K
determines a natural poly-action of F±
on X K , i.e., a natural isomorphism of F±
l
l
with some subquotient of Aut(X K ) [cf. Deﬁnition 6.1, (v)]. The F±

l
may be thought of as being essentially geoconstituted by this poly-action of F±

metric in nature, in the sense that the subgroup AutK (X K ) ⊆ Aut(X K ) [i.e., of
K-linear automorphisms] maps isomorphically onto the subquotient of Aut(X K )

that gives rise to this poly-action of F±
l . On the other hand, the global Fl symmetry of C K only extends to a “{1}-symmetry” [i.e., in essence, fails to extend!]

Perhaps the most basic kind of prime-strip is a D-prime-strip. When v ∈
V , the portion of a D-prime-strip labeled by v is given by a category equivalent
to [the full subcategory determined by the connected objects of] the category of
X
tempered coverings of X v [when v ∈ Vbad ] or ﬁnite étale coverings of −
→v [when
non

v ∈ Vgood ]. When v ∈ Varc , an analogous deﬁnition may be obtained by applying
the theory of Aut-holomorphic orbispaces developed in [AbsTopIII], §2. One variant
of the notion of a D-prime-strip is the notion of a D -prime-strip. When v ∈ Vnon ,
the portion of a D -prime-strip labeled by v is given by a category equivalent to
[the full subcategory determined by the connected objects of] the Galois category

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY I

associated to Gv ; when v ∈ Varc , an analogous deﬁnition may be given. In some
sense, D-prime-strips may be thought of as abstractions of the “local arithmetic
holomorphic structure” of [copies of] Fmod [which we regard as equipped with
the once-punctured elliptic curve XF ] — cf. the discussion of [AbsTopIII], §I3. On
the other hand, D -prime-strips may be thought of as “mono-analyticizations”
[i.e., roughly speaking, the arithmetic version of the underlying real analytic structure associated to a holomorphic structure] of D-prime-strips — cf. the discussion of
[AbsTopIII], §I3. Throughout the present series of papers, we shall use the notation

to denote mono-analytic structures.
Next, we recall the notion of a Frobenioid over a base category [cf. [FrdI]
for more details]. Roughly speaking, a Frobenioid [typically denoted “F”] may
be thought of as a category-theoretic abstraction of the notion of a category of
line bundles or monoids of divisors over a base category [typically denoted “D”]
of topological localizations [i.e., in the spirit of a “topos”] such as a Galois category. In addition to D- and D -prime-strips, we shall also consider various types
of prime-strips that arise from considering various natural Frobenioids — i.e., more
concretely, various natural monoids equipped with a Galois action — at v ∈ V. Perhaps the most basic type of prime-strip arising from such a natural monoid is an
F-prime-strip. Suppose, for simplicity, that v ∈ Vbad . Then v and F determine,
up to conjugacy, an algebraic closure F v of Kv . Write
· OF v for the ring of integers of F v ;
· OF ⊆ OF v for the multiplicative monoid of nonzero integers;
v

· OF× ⊆ OF v for the multiplicative monoid of units;
v

· OFμ ⊆ OF v for the multiplicative monoid of roots of unity;
v

· OFμ2l ⊆ OF v for the multiplicative monoid of 2l-th roots of unity;
v

· q ∈ OF v for a 2l-th root of the q-parameter of EF at v.
v

Thus, OF v , OF , OF× , OFμ , and OFμ2l are equipped with natural Gv -actions. The
v

v

v

v

portion of an F-prime-strip labeled by v is given by data isomorphic to the monoid
OF , equipped with its natural Πv ( Gv )-action [cf. Fig. I1.2]. There are various
v

mono-analytic versions of the notion of an F-prime-strip; perhaps the most basic
is the notion of an F  -prime-strip. The portion of an F  -prime-strip labeled by
v is given by data isomorphic to the monoid OF× × q N , equipped with its natural
v

v

Gv -action [cf. Fig. I1.2]. Often we shall regard these various mono-analytic versions of an F-prime-strip as being equipped with an additional global realiﬁed
Frobenioid, which, at a concrete level, corresponds, essentially, to considering var∼
ious arithmetic degrees ∈ R at v ∈ V ( → Vmod ) that are related to one another by
means of the product formula. Throughout the present series of papers, we shall
use the notation

of D-ΘNF- and D-Θ±ell -Hodge theaters summarized above [cf. also Fig. I1.3 below]
is one of the main topics of the present paper and is discussed in detail in §4 and
§6. The left-hand portion of Fig. I1.3 corresponds to the D-Θ±ell -Hodge theater;
the right-hand portion of Fig. I1.3 corresponds to the D-ΘNF-Hodge theater; these
left-hand and right-hand portions are glued together by identifying D-prime-strips
in such a way that the labels 0 = ±t ∈ Fl on the left are identiﬁed with the
corresponding label j ∈ F
l on the right [cf. Proposition 6.7; Remark 6.12.2; Fig.
6.5].
In this context, we remark that many of the constructions of [AbsTopIII] were
intended as prototypes for constructions of the present series of papers. For instance, the global theory of [AbsTopIII], §5, was intended as a sort of simpliﬁed
prototype for the Θ±ell NF-Hodge theaters of the present paper, i.e., except with
the various label bookkeeping devices deleted. The various panalocal objects of [AbsTopIII], §5, were intended as prototypes for the various types of prime-strips that

8

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

appear in the present series of papers. Perhaps most importantly, the theory of the
log-Frobenius functor and log-shells developed in [AbsTopIII], §3, §4, §5, was intended as a prototype for the theory of the log-link that is developed in [IUTchIII].
In particular, although most of the main ideas and techniques of [AbsTopIII],
§3, §4, §5, will play an important role in the present series of papers, many of the
constructions performed in [AbsTopIII], §3, §4, §5, will not be applied in a direct,
literal sense in the present series of papers.
The F±
l -symmetry has the advantange that, being geometric in nature, it
allows one to permute various copies of “Gv ” [where v ∈ Vnon ] associated to distinct labels ∈ Fl without inducing conjugacy indeterminacies. This phenomenon,
which we shall refer to as conjugate synchronization, will play a key role in
the Kummer theory surrounding the Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic evaluation of the
theta function at l-torsion points that is developed in [IUTchII]— cf. the discussion of Remark 6.12.6; [IUTchII], Remark 3.5.2, (ii), (iii); [IUTchII], Remark
4.5.3, (i). By contrast, the F
l -symmetry is more suited to situations in which one
must descend from K to Fmod . In the present series of papers, the most important
such situation involves the Kummer theory surrounding the reconstruction of
the number ﬁeld Fmod from the étale fundamental group of C K — cf. the discussion of Remark 6.12.6; [IUTchII], Remark 4.7.6. This reconstruction will be
discussed in Example 5.1 of the present paper. Here, we note that such situations
necessarily induce global Galois permutations of the various copies of “Gv ” [where
v ∈ Vnon ] associated to distinct labels ∈ F
l that are only well-deﬁned up to conjugacy indeterminacies. In particular, the F
l -symmetry is ill-suited to situations,
such as those that appear in the theory of Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic evaluation that
is developed in [IUTchII], that require one to establish conjugate synchronization.

[cf. Figs. 4.4, 4.7, 6.1, 6.3, 6.5 for more details]
Ultimately, when, in [IUTchIV], we consider diophantine applications of the
theory developed in the present series of papers, we will take the prime number
l to be “large”, i.e., roughly of the order of the square root of the height of the
elliptic curve EF [cf. [IUTchIV], Corollary 2.2, (ii), (C1)]. When l is regarded as
large, the arithmetic of the ﬁnite ﬁeld Fl “tends to approximate” the arithmetic of
the ring of rational integers Z. That is to say, the decomposition that occurs in
a Θ±ell NF-Hodge theater into the “additive” [i.e., F±
l -] and “multiplicative” [i.e.,
-]

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY I

the discussion of [AbsTopIII], §I3], of the ring Z — cf. the discussion of Remarks
6.12.3, 6.12.6.
Alternatively, this decomposition into additive and multiplicative symmetries
in the theory of Θ±ell NF-Hodge theaters may be compared to groups of additive and multiplicative symmetries of the upper half-plane [cf. Fig. I1.4
below]. Here, the “cuspidal” geometry expressed by the additive symmetries of
the upper half-plane admits a natural “associated coordinate”, namely, the classical q-parameter, which is reminiscent of the way in which the F±
l -symmetry
is well-adapted to the Kummer theory surrounding the Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic
evaluation of the theta function at l-torsion points [cf. the above discussion].
By contrast, the “toral”, or “nodal” [cf. the classical theory of the structure of
Hecke correspondences modulo p], geometry expressed by the multiplicative symmetries of the upper half-plane admits a natural “associated coordinate”, namely,
the classical biholomorphic isomorphism of the upper half-plane with the unit disc,
which is reminiscent of the way in which the F
l -symmetry is well-adapted to the
Kummer theory surrounding the number ﬁeld Fmod [cf. the above discussion].
For more details, we refer to the discussion of Remark 6.12.3, (iii).
From the point of view of the scheme-theoretic Hodge-Arakelov theory developed in [HASurI], [HASurII], the theory of the combinatorial structure of a Θ±ell NFHodge theater — and, indeed, the theory of the present series of papers! — may
be regarded as a sort of
solution to the problem of constructing “global multiplicative subspaces” and “global canonical generators” [cf. the quotient “Q” and
the cusp “” that appear in the above discussion!]
— the nonexistence of which in a “naive, scheme-theoretic sense” constitutes the
main obstruction to applying the theory of [HASurI], [HASurII] to diophantine
geometry [cf. the discussion of Remark 4.3.1]. Indeed, prime-strips may be
thought of as “local analytic sections” of the natural morphism Spec(K) →
Spec(Fmod ). Thus, it is precisely by working with such “local analytic sections” —
i.e., more concretely, by working with the collection of valuations V, as opposed to
the set of all valuations of K — that one can, in some sense, “simulate” the notions
of a “global multiplicative subspace” or a “global canonical generator”. On the other
hand, such “simulated global objects” may only be achieved at the cost of
“dismantling”, or performing “surgery” on, the global prime structure of the number ﬁelds involved [cf. the discussion of Remark 4.3.1]
— a quite drastic operation, which has the eﬀect of precipitating numerous technical
diﬃculties, whose resolution, via the theory of semi-graphs of anabelioids, Frobenioids, the étale theta function, and log-shells developed in [SemiAnbd], [FrdI],
[FrdII], [EtTh], and [AbsTopIII], constitutes the bulk of the theory of the present
series of papers! From the point of view of “performing surgery on the global prime
structure of a number ﬁeld”, the labels ∈ F
l that appear in the “arithmetic”

Fl -symmetry may be thought of as a sort of “miniature ﬁnite approximation” of this global prime structure, in the spirit of the idea of “Hodge theory at
ﬁnite resolution” discussed in [HASurI], §1.3.4. On the other hand, the labels ∈ Fl
that appear in the “geometric” F±
l -symmetry may be thought of as a sort

of “miniature ﬁnite approximation” of the natural tempered Z-coverings [i.e.,
tempered coverings with Galois group Z] of the Tate curves determined by EF at

discussed in [HASurI], §1.3.4.

As discussed above in our explanation of the models at v ∈ Vbad for F  -primestrips, by considering the 2l-th roots of the q-parameters of the elliptic curve EF
at v ∈ Vbad , and, roughly speaking, extending to v ∈ Vgood in such a way as to
satisfy the product formula, one may construct a natural F  -prime-strip “F
mod ”
[cf. Example 3.5, (ii); Deﬁnition 5.2, (iv)]. This construction admits an abstract,
algorithmic formulation that allows one to apply it to the underlying “Θ-Hodge
±ell
theater” of an arbitrary Θ±ell NF-Hodge theater † HT Θ NF so as to obtain an F  prime-strip
† 
Fmod
[cf. Deﬁnitions 3.6, (c); 5.2, (iv)]. On the other hand, by formally replacing the
2l-th roots of the q-parameters that appear in this construction by the reciprocal
of the l-th root of the Frobenioid-theoretic theta function, which we shall denote
“Θv ” [for v ∈ Vbad ], studied in [EtTh] [cf. also Example 3.2, (ii), of the present
paper], one obtains an abstract, algorithmic formulation for the construction of an
F  -prime-strip

Now let ‡ HT Θ NF be another Θ±ell NF-Hodge theater [relative to the given

In fact, the Θ-link discussed in the present paper is only a simpliﬁed version

The construction of the version of the Θ-link that we shall ultimately be interested
in is quite technically involved and, indeed, occupies the greater part of the theory

discussed in the present paper is of interest in that it allows one to give a relatively
straightforward introduction to many of the important qualitative properties of
the Θ-link — such as the Frobenius-picture discussed above and the étale-picture
to be discussed below — that will continue to be of central importance in the case
of the versions of the Θ-link that will be developed in [IUTchII], [IUTchIII].

Fig. I1.5: Frobenius-picture associated to the Θ-link
Now let us return to our discussion of the Frobenius-picture associated to the Θlink. The D -prime-strip associated to the F × -prime-strip † F×

naturally identiﬁed with the D -prime-strip † D> associated to a certain F-primestrip † F> [cf. the discussion preceding Example 5.4] that arises from the Θ-Hodge

of D -prime-strips. That is to say, when regarded up to isomorphism, the D prime-strip “(−) D> ” may be regarded as an invariant — i.e., a “mono-analytic
core” — of the various Θ±ell NF-Hodge theaters that occur in the Frobenius-picture
[cf. Corollaries 4.12, (ii); 6.10, (ii)]. Unlike the case with the Frobenius-picture,
±ell
the relationships of the various D-Θ±ell NF-Hodge theaters n HT D-Θ NF to this
mono-analytic core — relationships that are depicted by spokes in Fig. I1.6 below
— are compatible with arbitrary permutation symmetries among the spokes
[i.e., among the labels n ∈ Z of the D-Θ±ell NF-Hodge theaters] — cf. Corollaries
4.12, (iii); 6.10, (iii), (iv). The diagram depicted in Fig. I1.6 below will be referred
to as the étale-picture.
Thus, the étale-picture may, in some sense, be regarded as a collection of
canonical splittings of the Frobenius-picture. The existence of such splittings
suggests that

by applying various results from absolute anabelian geometry to the
various tempered and étale fundamental groups that constitute each DΘ±ell NF-Hodge theater in the étale-picture, one may obtain algorithmic
descriptions of — i.e., roughly speaking, one may take a “glimpse”

in the present series of papers and will be of particular importance in our treatment

Fig. I1.6: Étale-picture of D-Θ±ell NF-Hodge theaters
Before proceeding, we recall the “heuristic” notions of Frobenius-like — i.e.,
“order-conscious” — and étale-like — i.e., “indiﬀerent to order” — mathematical
structures discussed in [FrdI], §I4. These notions will play a key role in the theory
developed in the present series of papers. In particular, the terms “Frobeniuspicture” and “étale-picture” introduced above are motivated by these notions.
The main result of the present paper may be summarized as follows.

Theorem A. (F±

in the above discussion. Then one may construct a Θ±ell NF-Hodge theater [cf.

(ii) (Θ-links) By considering the 2l-th roots of the q-parameters “q ” of

symmetries among the spokes, i.e., among the labels n ∈ Z of the D-Θ±ell NFHodge theaters [cf. Corollaries 4.12, (ii), 6.10, (i)]. The diagram depicted in Fig.
I1.6 will be referred to as the étale-picture.
In addition to the main result discussed above, we also prove a certain technical
result concerning tempered fundamental groups — cf. Theorem B below —
that will be of use in our development of the theory of Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic
evaluation in [IUTchII]. This result is essentially a routine application of the theory of maximal compact subgroups of tempered fundamental groups developed in
[SemiAnbd] [cf., especially, [SemiAnbd], Theorems 3.7, 5.4, as well as Remark 2.5.3,
(ii), of the present paper]. Here, we recall that this theory of [SemiAnbd] may be
thought of as a sort of “Combinatorial Section Conjecture” [cf. Remark 2.5.1
of the present paper; [IUTchII], Remark 1.12.4] — a point of view that is of particular interest in light of the historical remarks made in §I5 below. Moreover, Theorem
B is of interest independently of the theory of the present series of papers in that
it yields, for instance, a new proof of the normal terminality of the tempered fundamental group in its proﬁnite completion, a result originally obtained in [André],
Lemma 3.2.1, by means of other techniques [cf. Remark 2.4.1]. This new proof
is of interest in that, unlike the techniques of [André], which are only available in
the proﬁnite case, this new proof [cf. Proposition 2.4, (iii)] holds in the case of
pro-Σ-completions, for more general Σ [i.e., not just the case of Σ = Primes].
Theorem B. (Proﬁnite Conjugates of Tempered Decomposition and
Inertia Groups) Let k be a mixed-characteristic [nonarchimedean] local
ﬁeld, X a hyperbolic curve over k. Write
Πtp
X

16

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

for the tempered fundamental group π1tp (X) [relative to a suitable basepoint]
of X [cf. [André], §4; [SemiAnbd], Example 3.10]; ΠX for the étale fundamental
group [relative to a suitable basepoint] of X. Thus, we have a natural inclusion
Πtp
X

→

ΠX

which allows one to identify ΠX with the proﬁnite completion of Πtp
X . Then every
decomposition group in ΠX (respectively, inertia group in ΠX ) associated to
a closed point or cusp of X (respectively, to a cusp of X) is contained in Πtp
X if
tp
and only if it is a decomposition group in ΠX (respectively, inertia group in Πtp
X)
associated to a closed point or cusp of X (respectively, to a cusp of X). Moreover,
tp
a ΠX -conjugate of Πtp
X contains a decomposition group in ΠX (respectively, inertia
group in Πtp
X ) associated to a closed point or cusp of X (respectively, to a cusp of
X) if and only if it is equal to Πtp
X.
Theorem B is [essentially] given as Corollary 2.5 [cf. also Remark 2.5.2] in
§2. Here, we note that although, in the statement of Corollary 2.5, the hyperbolic
curve X is assumed to admit stable reduction over the ring of integers Ok of k, one
veriﬁes immediately [by applying Proposition 2.4, (iii)] that this assumption is, in
fact, unnecessary.
Finally, we remark that one important reason for the need to apply Theorem B
in the context of the theory of Θ±ell NF-Hodge theaters summarized in Theorem A
is the following. The F±
l -symmetry, which will play a crucial role in the theory
of the present series of papers [cf., especially, [IUTchII], [IUTchIII]], depends, in an
essential way, on the synchronization of the ±-indeterminacies that occur locally
at each v ∈ V [cf. Fig. I1.1]. Such a synchronization may only be obtained by
making use of the global portion of the Θ±ell -Hodge theater under consideration.
On the other hand, in order to avail oneself of such global ±-synchronizations
[cf. Remark 6.12.4, (iii)], it is necessary to regard the various labels of the F±
l symmetry
( −l < . . . < −1 < 0 < 1 < . . . < l )
as conjugacy classes of inertia groups of the [necessarily] proﬁnite geometric étale
fundamental group of X K . That is to say, in order to relate such global proﬁnite
conjugacy classes to the corresponding tempered conjugacy classes [i.e., conjugacy
classes with respect to the geometric tempered fundamental group] of inertia groups
at v ∈ Vbad [i.e., where the crucial Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic evaluation is to be
performed!], it is necessary to apply Theorem B — cf. the discussion of Remark
4.5.1; [IUTchII], Remark 2.5.2, for more details.

constituted by the Frobenioids that appear in the various F  -prime-strips involved,
i.e., in essence, collections of monoids isomorphic to N or R≥0 [cf. Fig. I1.2].

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

If one thinks of the geometry of “conventional scheme theory” as being analogous to the geometry of “Euclidean space”, then the geometry represented by the
Frobenius-picture corresponds to a “topological manifold”, i.e., which is obtained by
gluing together various portions of Euclidean space, but which is not homeomorphic
to Euclidean space. This point of view is illustrated in Fig. I2.1 above, where the
various Θ±ell NF-Hodge theaters in the Frobenius-picture are depicted as [twodimensional! — cf. the discussion of §I1] twice-punctured topological surfaces
of genus one, glued together along tubular neighborhoods of cycles, which
correspond to the [one-dimensional! — cf. the discussion of §I1] mono-analytic
data that appears in the isomorphism that constitutes the Θ-link. The permutation symmetries in the étale-picture [cf. the discussion of §I1] are depicted in Fig.
I2.1 as the anti-holomorphic reﬂection [cf. the discussion of multiradiality in
[IUTchII], Introduction!] around a gluing cycle between topological surfaces.
Another elementary example that illustrates the spirit of the gluing operations
discussed in the present series of papers is the following. For i = 0, 1, let Ri be
a copy of the real line; Ii ⊆ Ri the closed unit interval [i.e., corresponding to
[0, 1] ⊆ R]. Write C0 ⊆ I0 for the Cantor set and
∼

φ : C0 → I1
for the bijection arising from the Cantor function. Then if one thinks of R0 and
R1 as being glued to one another by means of φ, then it is a highly nontrivial
problem
to describe structures naturally associated to the “alien” ring structure
of R0 — such as, for instance, the subset of algebraic numbers ∈ R0 —
in terms that only require the use of the ring structure of R1 .
A slightly less elementary example that illustrates the spirit of the gluing operations discussed in the present series of papers is the following. This example is
technically much closer to the theory of the present series of papers than the examples involving topological surfaces and Cantor sets given above. For simplicity, let
us write
G  O× , G  O
for the pairs “Gv  OF× ”, “Gv  OF ” [cf. the notation of the discussion
v

v

surrounding Fig. I1.2]. Recall from [AbsTopIII], Proposition 3.2, (iv), that the
operation
(G  O ) → G
of “forgetting O ” determines a bijection from the group of automorphisms of the
pair G  O — i.e., thought of as an abstract ind-topological monoid equipped
with a continuous action by an abstract topological group — to the group of automorphisms of the topological group G. By contrast, we recall from [AbsTopIII],
Proposition 3.3, (ii), that the operation
(G  O× )

→

G

of “forgetting O× ” only determines a surjection from the group of automorphisms
of the pair G  O× — i.e., thought of as an abstract ind-topological monoid

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY I

19

equipped with a continuous action by an abstract topological group — to the group
of automorphisms of the topological group G; that is to say, the kernel of this
surjection is given by the natural action of Z× on O× . In particular, if one works
with two copies Gi  Oi , where i = 0, 1, of G  O , which one thinks of as being
glued to one another by means of an indeterminate isomorphism
(G0  O0× )

∼

→

(G1  O1× )

[i.e., where one thinks of each (Gi  Oi× ), for i = 0, 1, as an abstract ind-topological
monoid equipped with a continuous action by an abstract topological group], then,
in general, it is a highly nontrivial problem
to describe structures naturally associated to (G0  O0 ) in terms that
only require the use of (G1  O1 ).
One such structure which is of interest in the context of the present series of papers
[cf., especially, the theory of [IUTchII], §1] is the natural cyclotomic rigidity
isomorphism between the group of torsion elements of O0 and an analogous
group of torsion elements naturally associated to G0 — i.e., a structure that is
manifestly not preserved by the natural action of Z× on O0× !
In the context of the above discussion of Fig. I2.1, it is of interest to note the
important role played by Kummer theory in the present series of papers [cf. the
Introductions to [IUTchII], [IUTchIII]]. From the point of view of Fig. I2.1, this
role corresponds to the precise speciﬁcation of the gluing cycle within each twicepunctured genus one surface in the illustration. Of course, such a precise speciﬁcation depends on the twice-punctured genus one surface under consideration, i.e.,
the same gluing cycle is subject to quite diﬀerent “precise speciﬁcations”, relative
to the twice-punctured genus one surface on the left and the twice-punctured genus
one surface on the right. This state of aﬀairs corresponds to the quite diﬀerent
Kummer theories to which the monoids/Frobenioids that appear in the Θ-link are
subject, relative to the Θ±ell NF-Hodge theater in the domain of the Θ-link and
the Θ±ell NF-Hodge theater in the codomain of the Θ-link. At ﬁrst glance, it might
appear that the use of Kummer theory, i.e., of the correspondence determined by
constructing Kummer classes, to achieve this precise speciﬁcation of the relevant
monoids/Frobenioids within each Θ±ell NF-Hodge theater is somewhat arbitrary,
i.e., that one could perhaps use other correspondences [i.e., correspondences not
determined by Kummer classes] to achieve such a precise speciﬁcation. In fact,
however, the rigidity of the relevant local and global monoids equipped with Galois actions [cf. Corollary 5.3, (i), (ii), (iv)] implies that, if one imposes the natural
condition of Galois-compatibility, then
the correspondence furnished by Kummer theory is the only acceptable choice for constructing the required “precise speciﬁcation of the
relevant monoids/Frobenioids within each Θ±ell NF-Hodge theater”
— cf. also the discussion of [IUTchII], Remark 3.6.2, (ii).
The construction of the Frobenius-picture described in §I1 is given in the
present paper. More elaborate versions of this Frobenius-picture will be discussed
in [IUTchII], [IUTchIII]. Once one constructs the Frobenius-picture, one natural

and fundamental problem, which will, in fact, be one of the main themes of the
present series of papers, is the problem of
describing an alien “arithmetic holomorphic structure” [i.e., an
±ell
alien “conventional scheme theory”] corresponding to some m HT Θ NF
in terms of a “known arithmetic holomorphic structure” corresponding to
±ell
n
HT Θ NF [where n = m]
— a problem, which, as discussed in §I1, will be approached, in the ﬁnal portion of
[IUTchIII], by applying various results from absolute anabelian geometry [i.e.,
more explicitly, the theory of [SemiAnbd], [EtTh], and [AbsTopIII]] to the various
tempered and étale fundamental groups that appear in the étale-picture.
The relevance to this problem of the extensive theory of “reconstruction of
ring/scheme structures” provided by absolute anabelian geometry is evident from
the statement of the problem. On the other hand, in this context, it is of interest to
note that, unlike conventional anabelian geometry, which typically centers on the
goal of reconstructing a “known scheme-theoretic object”, in the present series of
papers, we wish to apply techniques and results from anabelian geometry in order to
analyze the structure of an unknown, essentially non-scheme-theoretic object,
namely, the Frobenius-picture, as described above. Put another way, relative
to the point of view that “Galois groups are arithmetic tangent bundles” [cf. the
theory of the arithmetic Kodaira-Spencer morphism in [HASurI]], one may think
of conventional anabelian geometry as corresponding to the computation of the
automorphisms of a scheme as
H 0 (arithmetic tangent bundle)
and of the application of absolute anabelian geometry to the analysis of the Frobeniuspicture, i.e., to the solution of the problem discussed above, as corresponding to
the computation of
H 1 (arithmetic tangent bundle)
— i.e., the computation of “deformations of the arithmetic holomorphic
structure” of a number ﬁeld equipped with an elliptic curve.
In the context of the above discussion, we remark that the word “Hodge” in the
term “Hodge theater” was intended as a reference to the use of the word “Hodge”
in such classical terminology as “variation of Hodge structure” [cf. also the
discussion of Hodge ﬁltrations in [AbsTopIII], §I5], for instance, in discussions of
Torelli maps [the most fundamental special case of which arises from the tautological family of one-dimensional complex tori parametrized by the upper half-plane!],
where a “Hodge structure” corresponds precisely to the speciﬁcation of a particular holomorphic structure in a situation in which one considers variations of the
holomorphic structure on a ﬁxed underlying real analytic structure. That is to say,
later, in [IUTchIII], we shall see that the position occupied by a “Hodge theater”
within a much larger framework that will be referred to as the “log-theta-lattice” [cf.
the discussion of §I4 below] corresponds precisely to the speciﬁcation of a particular arithmetic holomorphic structure in a situation in which such arithmetic
holomorphic structures are subject to deformation.

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY I

§I3. Basepoints and Inter-universality
As discussed in §I2, the present series of papers is concerned with considering
“deformations of the arithmetic holomorphic structure” of a number ﬁeld — i.e., so
to speak, with performing “surgery on the number ﬁeld”. At a more concrete
level, this means that one must consider situations in which two distinct “theaters”
for conventional ring/scheme theory — i.e., two distinct Θ±ell NF-Hodge theaters
— are related to one another by means of a “correspondence”, or “ﬁlter”, that fails
to be compatible with the respective ring structures. In the discussion so far of
the portion of the theory developed in the present paper, the main example of such
a “ﬁlter” is given by the Θ-link. As mentioned earlier, more elaborate versions
of the Θ-link will be discussed in [IUTchII], [IUTchIII]. The other main example
of such a non-ring/scheme-theoretic “ﬁlter” in the present series of papers is the
log-link, which we shall discuss in [IUTchIII] [cf. also the theory of [AbsTopIII]].
One important aspect of such non-ring/scheme-theoretic ﬁlters is the property
that they are incompatible with various constructions that depend on the ring
structure of the theaters that constitute the domain and codomain of such a ﬁlter.
From the point of view of the present series of papers, perhaps the most important example of such a construction is given by the various étale fundamental
groups — e.g., Galois groups — that appear in these theaters. Indeed, these
groups are deﬁned, essentially, as automorphism groups of some separably closed
ﬁeld, i.e., the ﬁeld that arises in the deﬁnition of the ﬁber functor associated to the
basepoint determined by a geometric point that is used to deﬁne the étale fundamental group — cf. the discussion of [IUTchII], Remark 3.6.3, (i); [IUTchIII],
Remark 1.2.4, (i); [AbsTopIII], Remark 3.7.7, (i). In particular, unlike the case
with ring homomorphisms or morphisms of schemes with respect to which the étale
fundamental group satisﬁes well-known functoriality properties, in the case of nonring/scheme-theoretic ﬁlters, the only “type of mathematical object” that makes
sense simultaneously in both the domain and codomain theaters of the ﬁlter is the
notion of a topological group. In particular, the only data that can be considered in
relating étale fundamental groups on either side of a ﬁlter is the étale-like structure constituted by the underlying abstract topological group associated to
such an étale fundamental group, i.e., devoid of any auxiliary data arising from the
construction of the group “as an étale fundamental group associated to a basepoint determined by a geometric point of a scheme”. It is this fundamental aspect
of the theory of the present series of papers — i.e.,
of relating the distinct set-theoretic universes associated to the distinct
ﬁber functors/basepoints on either side of such a non-ring/scheme-theoretic
ﬁlter
— that we refer to as inter-universal. This inter-universal aspect of the theory
manifestly leads to the issue of considering
the extent to which one can understand various ring/scheme structures
by considering only the underlying abstract topological group of some
étale fundamental group arising from such a ring/scheme structure
— i.e., in other words, of considering the absolute anabelian geometry [cf. the
Introductions to [AbsTopI], [AbsTopII], [AbsTopIII]] of the rings/schemes under
consideration.

22

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

At this point, the careful reader will note that the above discussion of the
inter-universal aspects of the theory of the present series of papers depends, in
an essential way, on the issue of distinguishing diﬀerent “types of mathematical
objects” and hence, in particular, on the notion of a “type of mathematical object”.
This notion may be formalized via the language of “species”, which we develop
in the ﬁnal portion of [IUTchIV].
Another important “inter-universal” phenomenon in the present series of papers — i.e., phenomenon which, like the absolute anabelian aspects discussed above,
arises from a “deep sensitivity to particular choices of basepoints” — is the phenomenon of conjugate synchronization, i.e., of synchronization between conjugacy indeterminacies of distinct copies of various local Galois groups, which, as was
mentioned in §I1, will play an important role in the theory of [IUTchII], [IUTchIII].
The various rigidity properties of the étale theta function established in [EtTh]
constitute yet another inter-universal phenomenon that will play an important role
in theory of [IUTchII], [IUTchIII].

§I4. Relation to Complex and p-adic Teichmüller Theory
In order to understand the sense in which the theory of the present series
of papers may be thought of as a sort of “Teichmüller theory” of number ﬁelds
equipped with an elliptic curve, it is useful to recall certain basic, well-known facts
concerning the classical complex Teichmüller theory of Riemann surfaces of
ﬁnite type [cf., e.g., [Lehto], Chapter V, §8]. Although such a Riemann surface is
one-dimensional from a complex, holomorphic point of view, this single complex
dimension may be thought of consisting of two underlying real analytic dimensions.
Relative to a suitable canonical holomorphic coordinate z = x + iy on the Riemann
surface, the Teichmüller deformation may be written in the form
z → ζ = ξ + iη = Kx + iy
— where 1 < K < ∞ is the dilation factor associated to the deformation. That is
to say, the Teichmüller deformation consists of dilating one of the two underlying
real analytic dimensions, while keeping the other dimension ﬁxed. Moreover,
the theory of such Teichmüller deformations may be summarized as consisting of
the explicit description of a varying holomorphic structure within a
ﬁxed real analytic “container”
— i.e., the underlying real analytic surface associated to the given Riemann surface.
On the other hand, as discussed in [AbsTopIII], §I3, one may think of the ring
structure of a number ﬁeld F as a single “arithmetic holomorphic dimension”, which, in fact, consists of two underlying “combinatorial dimensions”,
corresponding to
· its additive structure “” and its multiplicative structure “”.
When, for simplicity, the number ﬁeld F is totally imaginary, one may think of
these two combinatorial dimensions as corresponding to the

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY I

23

· two cohomological dimensions of the absolute Galois group GF of F .
A similar statement holds in the case of the absolute Galois group Gk of a nonarchimedean local ﬁeld k. In the case of complex archimedean ﬁelds k [i.e.,
topological ﬁelds isomorphic to the ﬁeld of complex numbers equipped with its
usual topology], the two combinatorial dimensions of k may also be thought of as
corresponding to the
· two underlying topological/real dimensions of k.
Alternatively, in both the nonarchimedean and archimedean cases, one may think
of the two underlying combinatorial dimensions of k as corresponding to the
· group of units Ok× and value group k × /Ok× of k.
Indeed, in the nonarchimedean case, local class ﬁeld theory implies that this last
point of view is consistent with the interpretation of the two underlying combinatorial dimensions via cohomological dimension; in the archimedean case, the
consistency of this last point of view with the interpretation of the two underlying combinatorial dimensions via topological/real dimension is immediate from the
deﬁnitions.
This last interpretation in terms of groups of units and value groups is of
particular relevance in the context of the theory of the present series of papers.
That is to say, one may think of the Θ-link

Ftht

{ † Θv

— as a sort of “Teichmüller deformation relative to a Θ-dilation”, i.e., a deformation of the ring structure of the number ﬁeld equipped with an elliptic
curve constituted by the given initial Θ-data in which one dilates the underlying
combinatorial dimension corresponding to the local value groups relative to a “Θfactor”, while one leaves ﬁxed, up to isomorphism, the underlying combinatorial dimension corresponding to the local groups of units [cf. Remark 3.9.3]. This point
of view is reminiscent of the discussion in §I1 of “disentangling/dismantling”
of various structures associated to a number ﬁeld.
In [IUTchIII], we shall consider two-dimensional diagrams of Θ±ell NF-Hodge
theaters which we shall refer to as log-theta-lattices. The two dimensions of such
diagrams correspond precisely to the two underlying combinatorial dimensions of
a ring. Of these two dimensions, the “theta dimension” consists of the Frobeniuspicture associated to [more elaborate versions of] the Θ-link. Many of the important properties that involve this “theta dimension” are consequences of the theory
of [FrdI], [FrdII], [EtTh]. On the other hand, the “log dimension” consists of iterated copies of the log-link, i.e., diagrams of the sort that are studied in [AbsTopIII].

24

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

That is to say, whereas the “theta dimension” corresponds to “deformations of the
arithmetic holomorphic structure” of the given number ﬁeld equipped with an elliptic curve, this “log dimension” corresponds to “rotations of the two underlying
combinatorial dimensions” of a ring that leave the arithmetic holomorphic structure ﬁxed — cf. the discussion of the “juggling of ,  induced by log” in
[AbsTopIII], §I3. The ultimate conclusion of the theory of [IUTchIII] is that
the “a priori unbounded deformations” of the arithmetic holomorphic
structure given by the Θ-link in fact admit canonical bounds, which
may be thought of as a sort of reﬂection of the “hyperbolicity” of the
given number ﬁeld equipped with an elliptic curve
— cf. [IUTchIII], Corollary 3.12. Such canonical bounds may be thought of as
analogues for a number ﬁeld of canonical bounds that arise from diﬀerentiating
Frobenius liftings in the context of p-adic hyperbolic curves — cf. the discussion in the ﬁnal portion of [AbsTopIII], §I5. Moreover, such canonical bounds are
obtained in [IUTchIII] as a consequence of
the explicit description of a varying arithmetic holomorphic structure within a ﬁxed mono-analytic “container”
— cf. the discussion of §I2! — furnished by [IUTchIII], Theorem 3.11 [cf. also
the discussion of [IUTchIII], Remarks 3.12.2, 3.12.3, 3.12.4], i.e., a situation that
is entirely formally analogous to the summary of complex Teichmüller theory given
above.
The signiﬁcance of the log-theta-lattice is best understood in the context of
the analogy between the inter-universal Teichmüller theory developed in the
present series of papers and the p-adic Teichmüller theory of [pOrd], [pTeich].
Here, we recall for the convenience of the reader that the p-adic Teichmüller theory
of [pOrd], [pTeich] may be summarized, [very!] roughly speaking, as a sort of
generalization, to the case of “quite general” p-adic hyperbolic curves, of
the classical p-adic theory surrounding the canonical representation
π1 ( (P1 \ {0, 1, ∞})Qp )

→

π1 ( (Mell )Qp )

→

P GL2 (Zp )

— where the “π1 (−)’s” denote the étale fundamental group, relative to a suitable
basepoint; (Mell )Qp denotes the moduli stack of elliptic curves over Qp ; the ﬁrst
arrow denotes the morphism induced by the elliptic curve over the projective line
minus three points determined by the classical Legendre form of the Weierstrass
equation; the second arrow is the representation determined by the p-power torsion
points of the tautological elliptic curve over (Mell )Qp . In particular, the reader who
is familiar with the theory of the classical representation of the above display, but
not with the theory of [pOrd], [pTeich], may nevertheless appreciate, to a substantial
degree, the analogy between the inter-universal Teichmüller theory developed in the
present series of papers and the p-adic Teichmüller theory of [pOrd], [pTeich] by
thinking in terms of the
well-known classical properties of this classical representation.
In some sense, the gap between the “quite general” p-adic hyperbolic curves that
appear in p-adic Teichmüller theory and the classical case of (P1 \ {0, 1, ∞})Qp may

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY I

25

be thought of, roughly speaking, as corresponding, relative to the analogy with the
theory of the present series of papers, to the gap between arbitrary number ﬁelds
and the rational number ﬁeld Q. This point of view is especially interesting in
the context of the discussion of §I5 below.
The analogy between the inter-universal Teichmüller theory developed in
the present series of papers and the p-adic Teichmüller theory of [pOrd], [pTeich]
is described to a substantial degree in the discussion of [AbsTopIII], §I5, i.e., where
the “future Teichmüller-like extension of the mono-anabelian theory” may be understood as referring precisely to the inter-universal Teichmüller theory developed
in the present series of papers. The starting point of this analogy is the correspondence between a number ﬁeld equipped with a [once-punctured] elliptic curve [in the
present series of papers] and a hyperbolic curve over a positive characteristic perfect
ﬁeld equipped with a nilpotent ordinary indigenous bundle [in p-adic Teichmüller
theory] — cf. Fig. I4.1 below. That is to say, in this analogy, the number ﬁeld —
which may be regarded as being equipped with a ﬁnite collection of “exceptional”
valuations, namely, in the notation of §I1, the valuations lying over Vbad
mod — corresponds to the hyperbolic curve over a positive characteristic perfect ﬁeld — which
may be thought of as a one-dimensional function ﬁeld over a positive characteristic
perfect ﬁeld, equipped with a ﬁnite collection of “exceptional” valuations, namely,
the valuations corresponding to the cusps of the curve.
On the other hand, the [once-punctured] elliptic curve in the present series
of papers corresponds to the nilpotent ordinary indigenous bundle in p-adic Teichmüller theory. Here, we recall that an indigenous bundle may be thought of as a
sort of “virtual analogue” of the ﬁrst cohomology group of the tautological elliptic
curve over the moduli stack of elliptic curves. Indeed, the canonical indigenous
bundle over the moduli stack of elliptic curves arises precisely as the ﬁrst de Rham
cohomology module of this tautological elliptic curve. Put another way, from the
point of view of fundamental groups, an indigenous bundle may be thought of as
a sort of “virtual analogue” of the abelianized fundamental group of the tautological elliptic curve over the moduli stack of elliptic curves. By contrast, in the
present series of papers, it is of crucial importance to use the entire nonabelian
proﬁnite étale fundamental group — i.e., not just its abelizanization! — of the
given once-punctured elliptic curve over a number ﬁeld. Indeed, only by working
with the entire proﬁnite étale fundamental group can one avail oneself of the crucial
absolute anabelian theory developed in [EtTh], [AbsTopIII] [cf. the discussion
of §I3]. This state of aﬀairs prompts the following question:

To what extent can one extend the indigenous bundles that appear in classical complex and p-adic Teichmüller theory to objects that serve as “virtual analogues” of the entire nonabelian fundamental group of the
tautological once-punctured elliptic curve over the moduli stack of [oncepunctured] elliptic curves?
Although this question lies beyond the scope of the present series of papers, it is

Fig. I4.1: Correspondence between inter-universal Teichmüller theory and
p-adic Teichmüller theory
Now let us return to our discussion of the log-theta-lattice, which, as discussed
above, consists of two types of arrows, namely, Θ-link arrows and log-link arrows. As discussed in [IUTchIII], Remark 1.4.1, (iii) — cf. also Fig. I4.1 above,
as well as Remark 3.9.3, (i), of the present paper — the Θ-link arrows correspond
to the “transition from pn Z/pn+1 Z to pn−1 Z/pn Z”, i.e., the mixed characteristic extension structure of a ring of Witt vectors, while the log-link arrows, i.e.,

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY I

27

the portion of theory that is developed in detail in [AbsTopIII], and which will be
incorporated into the theory of the present series of papers in [IUTchIII], correspond to the Frobenius morphism in positive characteristic. As we shall see in
[IUTchIII], these two types of arrows fail to commute [cf. [IUTchIII], Remark 1.4.1,
(i)]. This noncommutativity, or “intertwining”, of the Θ-link and log-link arrows
of the log-theta-lattice may be thought of as the analogue, in the context of the
theory of the present series of papers, of the well-known “intertwining between the
mixed characteristic extension structure of a ring of Witt vectors and the Frobenius
morphism in positive characteristic” that appears in the classical p-adic theory. In
particular, taken as a whole, the log-theta-lattice in the theory of the present series
of papers may be thought of as an analogue, for number ﬁelds equipped with a
[once-punctured] elliptic curve, of the canonical lifting, equipped with a canonical Frobenius action — hence also the canonical Frobenius lifting over the
ordinary locus of the curve — associated to a positive characteristic hyperbolic
curve equipped with a nilpotent ordinary indigenous bundle in p-adic Teichmüller
theory [cf. Fig. I4.1 above; the discussion of [IUTchIII], Remarks 3.12.3, 3.12.4].
Finally, we observe that it is of particular interest in the context of the present
discussion that a theory is developed in [CanLift], §3, that yields an absolute
anabelian reconstruction for the canonical liftings of p-adic Teichmüller theory. That is to say, whereas the original construction of such canonical liftings
given in [pOrd], §3, is relatively straightforward, the anabelian reconstruction given
in [CanLift], §3, of, for instance, the canonical lifting modulo p2 of the logarithmic special ﬁber consists of a highly nontrivial anabelian argument. This state of
aﬀairs is strongly reminiscent of the stark contrast between the relatively straightforward construction of the log-theta-lattice given in the present series of papers and
the description of an “alien arithmetic holomorphic structure” given in [IUTchIII],
Theorem 3.11 [cf. the discussion in the earlier portion of the present §I4], which
is achieved by applying highly nontrivial results in absolute anabelian geometry —
cf. Fig. I4.1 above. In this context, we observe that the absolute anabelian theory
of [AbsTopIII], §1, which plays a central role in the theory surrounding [IUTchIII],
Theorem 3.11, corresponds, in the theory of [CanLift], §3, to the absolute anabelian
reconstruction of the logarithmic special ﬁber given in [AbsAnab], §2 [i.e., in essence,
the theory of absolute anabelian geometry over ﬁnite ﬁelds developed in [Tama1]; cf.
also [Cusp], §2]. Moreover, just as the absolute anabelian theory of [AbsTopIII], §1,
follows essentially by combining a version of “Uchida’s Lemma” [cf. [AbsTopIII],
Proposition 1.3] with the theory of Belyi cuspidalization — i.e.,
[AbsTopIII], §1 = Uchida Lem. + Belyi cuspidalization
— the absolute anabelian geometry over ﬁnite ﬁelds of [Tama1], [Cusp], follows
essentially by combining a version of “Uchida’s Lemma” with an application [to
the counting of rational points] of the Lefschetz trace formula for [powers of ] the
Frobenius morphism on a curve over a ﬁnite ﬁeld — i.e.,
[Tama1], [Cusp] = Uchida Lem. + Lefschetz trace formula for Frob.
— cf. the discussion of [AbsTopIII], §I5. That is to say, it is perhaps worthy of
note that in the analogy between the inter-universal Teichmüller theory developed
in the present series of papers and the p-adic Teichmüller theory of [pOrd], [pTeich],
[CanLift], the application of the theory of Belyi cuspidalization over number ﬁelds

28

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

and mixed characteristic local ﬁelds may be thought of as corresponding to the
Lefschetz trace formula for [powers of] the Frobenius morphism on a curve over a
ﬁnite ﬁeld, i.e.,
Belyi cuspidalization

←→

Lefschetz trace formula for Frobenius

[Here, we note in passing that this correspondence may be related to the correspondence discussed in [AbsTopIII], §I5, between Belyi cuspidalization and the
Verschiebung on positive characteristic indigenous bundles by considering the geometry of Hecke correspondences modulo p, i.e., in essence, graphs of the Frobenius
morphism in characteristic p!] It is the hope of the author that these analogies and
correspondences might serve to stimulate further developments in the theory.
§I5. Other Galois-theoretic Approaches to Diophantine Geometry
The notion of anabelian geometry dates back to a famous “letter to Faltings” [cf. [Groth]], written by Grothendieck in response to Faltings’ work on the
Mordell Conjecture [cf. [Falt]]. Anabelian geometry was apparently originally conceived by Grothendieck as a new approach to obtaining results in diophantine
geometry such as the Mordell Conjecture. At the time of writing, the author is
not aware of any expositions by Grothendieck that expose this approach in detail.
Nevertheless, it appears that the thrust of this approach revolves around applying
the Section Conjecture for hyperbolic curves over number ﬁelds to obtain a contradiction by applying this Section Conjecture to the “limit section” of the Galois
sections associated to any inﬁnite sequence of rational points of a proper hyperbolic
curve over a number ﬁeld [cf. [MNT], §4.1(B), for more details]. On the other hand,
to the knowledge of the author, at least at the time of writing, it does not appear
that any rigorous argument has been obtained either by Grothendieck or by other
mathematicians for deriving a new proof of the Mordell Conjecture from the [as
yet unproven] Section Conjecture for hyperbolic curves over number ﬁelds. Nevertheless, one result that has been obtained is a new proof by M. Kim [cf. [Kim]]
of Siegel’s theorem concerning Q-rational points of the projective line minus three
points — a proof which proceeds by obtaining certain bounds on the cardinality
of the set of Galois sections, without applying the Section Conjecture or any other
results from anabelian geometry.
In light of the historical background just discussed, the theory exposed in
the present series of papers — which yields, in particular, a method for applying
results in absolute anabelian geometry to obtain diophantine results such
as those given in [IUTchIV] — occupies a somewhat curious position, relative to
the historical development of the mathematical ideas involved. That is to say, at a
purely formal level, the implication
anabelian geometry

=⇒

diophantine results

at ﬁrst glance looks something like a “conﬁrmation” of Grothendieck’s original
intuition. On the other hand, closer inspection reveals that the approach of the
theory of the present series of papers — that is to say, the precise content of the
relationship between anabelian geometry and diophantine geometry established in

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY I

29

the present series of papers — diﬀers quite fundamentally from the sort of approach
that was apparently envisioned by Grothendieck.
Perhaps the most characteristic aspect of this diﬀerence lies in the central role
played by anabelian geometry over p-adic ﬁelds in the present series of papers.
That is to say, unlike the case with number ﬁelds, one central feature of anabelian
geometry over p-adic ﬁelds is the fundamental gap between relative and absolute
results [cf., e.g., [AbsTopI], Introduction]. This fundamental gap is closely related
to the notion of an “arithmetic Teichmüller theory for number ﬁelds” [cf.
the discussion of §I4 of the present paper; [AbsTopIII], §I3, §I5] — i.e., a theory of
deformations not for the “arithmetic holomorphic structure” of a hyperbolic curve
over a number ﬁeld, but rather for the “arithmetic holomorphic structure” of the
number ﬁeld itself! To the knowledge of the author, there does not exist any mention
of such ideas [i.e., relative vs. absolute p-adic anabelian geometry; the notion of an
arithmetic Teichmüller theory for number ﬁelds] in the works of Grothendieck.
As discussed in §I4, one fundamental theme of the theory of the present series
of papers is the issue of the
explicit description of the relationship between the additive structure and
the multiplicative structure of a ring/number ﬁeld/local ﬁeld.
Relative to the above discussion of the relationship between anabelian geometry
and diophantine geometry, it is of interest to note that this issue of understanding/describing the relationship between addition and multiplication is, on the one
hand, a central theme in the proofs of various results in anabelian geometry [cf.,
e.g., [Tama1], [pGC], [AbsTopIII]] and, on the other hand, a central aspect of the
diophantine results obtained in [IUTchIV].
From a historical point of view, it is also of interest to note that results from absolute anabelian geometry are applied in the present series of papers in the context
of the canonical splittings of the Frobenius-picture that arise by considering the
étale-picture [cf. the discussion in §I1 preceding Theorem A]. This state of aﬀairs
is reminiscent — relative to the point of view that the Grothendieck Conjecture
constitutes a sort of “anabelian version” of the Tate Conjecture for abelian varieties
[cf. the discussion of [MNT], §1.2] — of the role played by the Tate Conjecture for
abelian varieties in obtaining the diophantine results of [Falt], namely, by means
of the various semi-simplicity properties of the Tate module that arise as formal
consequences of the Tate Conjecture. That is to say, such semi-simplicity properties may also be thought of as “canonical splittings” that arise from Galois-theoretic
considerations [cf. the discussion of “canonical splittings” in the ﬁnal portion of
[CombCusp], Introduction].
Certain aspects of the relationship between the inter-universal Teichmüller
theory of the present series of papers and other Galois-theoretic approaches to diophantine geometry are best understood in the context of the analogy, discussed in
§I4, between inter-universal Teichmüller theory and p-adic Teichmüller theory.
One way to think of the starting point of p-adic Teichmüller is as an attempt to
construct a p-adic analogue of the theory of the action of SL2 (Z) on the upper
half-plane, i.e., of the natural embedding
ρR :

SL2 (Z)

→

SL2 (R)

30

of SL2 (Z) as a discrete subgroup. This leads naturally to consideration of the
representation
ρZ =

ρZp :

SL2 (Z)∧

→

SL2 (Z) =

p

SL2 (Zp )
p∈Primes

— where we write SL2 (Z)∧ for the proﬁnite completion of SL2 (Z). If one thinks
of SL2 (Z)∧ as the geometric étale fundamental group of the moduli stack of elliptic
curves over a ﬁeld of characteristic zero, then the p-adic Teichmüller theory of
[pOrd], [pTeich] does indeed constitute a generalization of ρZp to more general padic hyperbolic curves.
From a representation-theoretic point of view, the next natural direction
in which to further develop the theory of [pOrd], [pTeich] consists of attempting to
generalize the theory of representations into SL2 (Zp ) obtained in [pOrd], [pTeich]
to a theory concerning representations into SLn (Zp ) for arbitrary n ≥ 2. This is
precisely the motivation that lies, for instance, behind the work of Joshi and Pauly
[cf. [JP]].
On the other hand, unlike the original motivating representation ρR , the representation ρZ is far from injective, i.e., put another way, the so-called Congruence
Subgroup Property fails to hold in the case of SL2 . This failure of injectivity means
that working with
ρZ only allows one to access a relatively limited portion of SL2 (Z)∧ .
From this point of view, a more natural direction in which to further develop the
theory of [pOrd], [pTeich] is to consider the “anabelian version”
ρΔ :

SL2 (Z)∧

→

Out(Δ1,1 )

of ρZ — i.e., the natural outer representation on the geometric étale fundamental group Δ1,1 of the tautological family of once-punctured elliptic curves over the
moduli stack of elliptic curves over a ﬁeld of characteristic zero. Indeed, unlike the
case with ρZ , one knows [cf. [Asada]] that ρΔ is injective. Thus, the “arithmetic
Teichmüller theory for number ﬁelds equipped with a [once-punctured] elliptic curve” constituted by the inter-universal Teichmüller theory developed in
the present series of papers may [cf. the discussion of §I4!] be regarded as a
realization of this sort of “anabelian” approach to further developing the p-adic
Teichmüller theory of [pOrd], [pTeich].
In the context of these two distinct possible directions for the further development of the p-adic Teichmüller theory of [pOrd], [pTeich], it is of interest to recall
the following elementary fact:
If G is a free pro-p group of rank ≥ 2, then a [continuous] representation
ρG : G → GLn (Qp )
can never be injective!
Indeed, assume that ρG is injective and write . . . ⊆ Hj ⊆ . . . ⊆ Im(ρG ) ⊆ GLn (Qp )
for an exhaustive sequence of open normal subgroups of the image of ρG . Then since

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY I

31

the Hj are closed subgroups of GLn (Qp ), hence p-adic Lie groups, it follows that the
Qp -dimension dim(Hjab ⊗ Qp ) of the tensor product with Qp of the abelianization
of Hj may be computed at the level of Lie algebras, hence is bounded by the Qp dimension of the p-adic Lie group GLn (Qp ), i.e., we have dim(Hjab ⊗ Qp ) ≤ n2 , in
contradiction to the well-known fact since G ∼
= Im(ρG ) is free pro-p of rank ≥ 2, it
holds that dim(Hjab ⊗ Qp ) → ∞ as j → ∞. Note, moreover, that
this sort of argument, i.e., concerning the asymptotic behavior of the
abelianizations — or, more generally, of the Lie algebras associated to
the pro-algebraic groups determined by associated Tannakian categories
of representations — of open subgroups, is characteristic of the sort of
proofs that typically occur in anabelian geometry [cf., e.g., the proofs
of [Tama1], [pGC], [CombGC], as well as [Cusp], §3!].
That is to say, the above argument to the eﬀect that ρG can never be injective is a
typical instance of the more general phenomenon that
so long as one restricts oneself to representation theory into GLn (Qp )
[or even more general groups that arise as groups of Qp -valued points
of pro-algebraic groups], one can never access the sort of asymptotic
phenomena that form the “technical core” [cf., e.g., the proofs of
[Tama1], [pGC], [CombGC], as well as [Cusp], §3!] of various important
results in anabelian geometry.
Put another way, the two “directions” discussed above — i.e., representationtheoretic and anabelian — appear to be essentially mutually alien to one
another.
In this context, it is of interest to observe that the diophantine results derived in [IUTchIV] from the inter-universal Teichmüller theory developed in the
present series of papers concern essentially asymptotic behavior, i.e., they do
not concern properties of “a speciﬁc rational point over a speciﬁc number ﬁeld”,
but rather properties of the asymptotic behavior of “varying rational points over
varying number ﬁelds”. One important aspect of this asymptotic nature of the diophantine results derived in [IUTchIV] is that there are no distinguished number
ﬁelds that occur in the theory, i.e., the theory — being essentially asymptotic in
nature! — is “invariant” with respect to the operation of passing to ﬁnite extensions of the number ﬁeld involved [which, from the point of view of the absolute
Galois group GQ of Q, corresponds precisely to the operation of passing to smaller
and smaller open subgroups, as in the above discussion!]. This contrasts sharply
with the “representation-theoretic approach to diophantine geometry” constituted
by such works as [Wiles], where speciﬁc rational points over the speciﬁc number ﬁeld
Q — or, for instance, in generalizations of [Wiles] involving Shimura varieties, over
speciﬁc number ﬁelds characteristically associated to the Shimura varieties involved
— play a central role.

Section 0: Notations and Conventions

Monoids and Categories:
We shall use the notation and terminology concerning monoids and categories
of [FrdI], §0.
We shall refer to a topological space P equipped with a continuous map
P ×P ⊇S → P
as a topological pseudo-monoid if there exists a topological abelian group M [whose
group operation will be written multiplicatively] and an embedding of topological
spaces ι : P → M such that S = {(a, b) ∈ P × P | ι(a) · ι(b) ∈ ι(P ) ⊆ M }, and
the map S → P is obtained by restricting the group operation M × M → M on
M to P by means of ι. Here, if M is equipped with the discrete topology, then
we shall refer to the resulting P simply as a pseudo-monoid. In particular, every
topological pseudo-monoid determines, in an evident fashion, an underlying pseudomonoid. Let P be a pseudo-monoid. Then we shall say that the pseudo-monoid
P is divisible if M and ι may be taken such that for each positive integer n, every
element of M admits an n-th root in M , and, moreover, an element a ∈ M lies
in ι(P ) if and only if an lies in ι(P ). We shall say that the pseudo-monoid P is
cyclotomic if M and ι may be taken such that the subgroup μM ⊆ M of torsion
elements of M is isomorphic to the group Q/Z, μM ⊆ ι(P ), and μM · ι(P ) ⊆ ι(P ).
We shall refer to an isomorphic copy of some object as an isomorph of the
object.
If C and D are categories, then we shall refer to as an isomorphism C → D any
isomorphism class of equivalences of categories C → D. [Note that this terminology
diﬀers from the standard terminology of category theory, but will be natural in the
context of the theory of the present series of papers.] Thus, from the point of view
of “coarsiﬁcations of 2-categories of 1-categories” [cf. [FrdI], Appendix, Deﬁnition
A.1, (ii)], an “isomorphism C → D” is precisely an “isomorphism in the usual sense”
of the [1-]category constituted by the coarsiﬁcation of the 2-category of all small
1-categories relative to a suitable universe with respect to which C and D are small.
Let C be a category; A, B ∈ Ob(C). Then we deﬁne a poly-morphism A → B
to be a collection of morphisms A → B [i.e., a subset of the set of morphisms
A → B]; if all of the morphisms in the collection are isomorphisms, then we shall
refer to the poly-morphism as a poly-isomorphism; if A = B, then we shall re∼
fer to a poly-isomorphism A → B as a poly-automorphism. We deﬁne the full
∼
poly-isomorphism A → B to be the poly-morphism given by the collection of all
∼
isomorphisms A → B. The composite of a poly-morphism {fi : A → B}i∈I with a
poly-morphism {gj : B → C}j∈J is deﬁned to be the poly-morphism given by the
set [i.e., where “multiplicities” are ignored] {gj ◦ fi : A → C}(i,j)∈I×J .
Let C be a category. We deﬁne a capsule of objects of C to be a ﬁnite collection
{Aj }j∈J [i.e., where J is a ﬁnite index set] of objects Aj of C; if |J| denotes the

34

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

cardinality of J, then we shall refer to a capsule with index set J as a |J|-capsule;
def

also, we shall write π0 ({Aj }j∈J ) = J. A morphism of capsules of objects of C
{Aj }j∈J → {Aj  }j  ∈J 
is deﬁned to consist of an injection ι : J → J  , together with, for each j ∈ J, a
morphism Aj → Aι(j) of objects of C. Thus, the capsules of objects of C form a
category Capsule(C). A capsule-full poly-morphism
{Aj }j∈J → {Aj  }j  ∈J 
between two objects of Capsule(C) is deﬁned to be the poly-morphism associated
to some [ﬁxed] injection ι : J → J  which consists of the set of morphisms of
∼
Capsule(C) given by collections of [arbitrary] isomorphisms Aj → Aι(j) , for j ∈
J. A capsule-full poly-isomorphism is a capsule-full poly-morphism for which the
associated injection between index sets is a bijection.
If X is a connected noetherian algebraic stack which is generically scheme-like
[cf. [Cusp], §0], then we shall write
B(X)
for the category of ﬁnite étale coverings of X [and morphisms over X]; if A is a
def

noetherian [commutative] ring [with unity], then we shall write B(A) = B(Spec(A)).
Thus, [cf. [FrdI], §0] the subcategory of connected objects B(X)0 ⊆ B(X) may
be thought of as the subcategory of connected ﬁnite étale coverings of X [and
morphisms over X].
Let Π be a topological group. Then let us write
B temp (Π)
for the category whose objects are countable [i.e., of cardinality ≤ the cardinality
of the set of natural numbers], discrete sets equipped with a continuous Π-action,
and whose morphisms are morphisms of Π-sets [cf. [SemiAnbd], §3]. If Π may be
written as an inverse limit of an inverse system of surjections of countable discrete
topological groups, then we shall say that Π is tempered [cf. [SemiAnbd], Deﬁnition
3.1, (i)]. A category C equivalent to a category of the form B temp (Π), where Π is a
tempered topological group, is called a connected temperoid [cf. [SemiAnbd], Deﬁnition 3.1, (ii)]. Thus, if C is a connected temperoid, then C is naturally equivalent
to (C 0 ) [cf. [FrdI], §0]. Moreover, if Π is Galois-countable [cf. Remark 2.5.3, (i),
(T1)], then one can reconstruct [cf. Remark 2.5.3, (i), (T5)] the topological group Π,
up to inner automorphism, category-theoretically from B temp (Π) or B temp (Π)0 [i.e.,
the subcategory of connected objects of B temp (Π)]; in particular, for any Galoiscountable [cf. Remark 2.5.3, (i), (T1)] connected temperoid C, it makes sense to
write
π1 (C), π1 (C 0 )
for the topological groups, up to inner automorphism, obtained by applying this
reconstruction algorithm [cf. Remark 2.5.3, (i), (T5)].

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY I

35

In this context, if C1 , C2 are connected temperoids, then it is natural to deﬁne
a morphism
C 1 → C2
to be an isomorphism class of functors C2 → C1 that preserves ﬁnite limits and
countable colimits. [Note that this diﬀers — but only slightly! — from the deﬁnition
given in [SemiAnbd], Deﬁnition 3.1, (iii). This diﬀerence does not, however, have
any eﬀect on the applicability of results of [SemiAnbd] in the context of the present
series of papers.] In a similar vein, we deﬁne a morphism
C10 → C20
to be a morphism (C10 ) → (C20 ) [where we recall that we have natural equivalences
∼
of categories Ci → (Ci0 ) for i = 1, 2]. One veriﬁes immediately that an “isomorphism” relative to this terminology is equivalent to an “isomorphism of categories”
in the sense deﬁned at the beginning of the present discussion of “Monoids and
Categories”. Finally, if Π1 , Π2 are Galois-countable [cf. Remark 2.5.3, (i), (T1)]
tempered topological groups, then we recall that there is a natural bijective correspondence between
(a) the set of continuous outer homomorphisms Π1 → Π2 ,
(b) the set of morphisms B temp (Π1 ) → B temp (Π2 ), and
(c) the set of morphisms B temp (Π1 )0 → B temp (Π2 )0
— cf. Remark 2.5.3, (ii), (E7); [SemiAnbd], Proposition 3.2.
Suppose that for i = 1, 2, Ci and Ci are categories. Then we shall say that two
isomorphism classes of functors φ : C1 → C2 , φ : C1 → C2 are abstractly equivalent
∼
if, for i = 1, 2, there exist isomorphisms αi : Ci → Ci such that φ ◦ α1 = α2 ◦ φ. We
shall also apply this terminology to morphisms between [connected] temperoids,
as well as to morphisms between subcategories of connected objects of [connected]
temperoids.
Numbers:
We shall use the abbreviations NF (“number ﬁeld”), MLF (“mixed-characteristic [nonarchimedean] local ﬁeld”), CAF (“complex archimedean ﬁeld”), as deﬁned
in [AbsTopI], §0; [AbsTopIII], §0. We shall denote the set of prime numbers by
Primes.
Let F be a number ﬁeld [i.e., a ﬁnite extension of the ﬁeld of rational numbers].
Then we shall write
V(F )non
V(F ) = V(F )arc
for the set of valuations of F , that is to say, the union of the sets of archimedean
[i.e., V(F )arc ] and nonarchimedean [i.e., V(F )non ] valuations of F . Here, we note
that this terminology “valuation”, as it is applied in the present series of papers,
corresponds to such terminology as “place” or “absolute value” in the work of other
authors. Let v ∈ V(F ). Then we shall write Fv for the completion of F at v and
say that an element of F or Fv is integral [at v] if it is of norm ≤ 1 with respect
to the valuation v; if, moreover, L is any [possibly inﬁnite] Galois extension of F ,

36

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

then, by a slight abuse of notation, we shall write Lv for the completion of L at
some valuation ∈ V(L) that lies over v. If v ∈ V(F )non , then we shall write pv
for the residue characteristic of v. If v ∈ V(F )arc , then we shall write pv ∈ Fv
for the unique positive real element of Fv whose natural logarithm is equal to 1
[i.e., “e = 2.71828 . . . ”]. By passing to appropriate projective or inductive limits,
we shall also apply the notation “V(F )”, “Fv ”, “pv ” in situations where “F ” is an
inﬁnite extension of Q.
Curves:
We shall use the terms hyperbolic curve, cusp, stable log curve, and smooth
log curve as they are deﬁned in [SemiAnbd], §0. We shall use the term hyperbolic
orbicurve as it is deﬁned in [Cusp], §0.

Section 1: Complements on Coverings of Punctured Elliptic Curves
In the present §1, we discuss certain routine complements — which will be of
use in the present series of papers — to the theory of coverings of once-punctured
elliptic curves, as developed in [EtTh], §2.
Let l ≥ 5 be an integer prime to 6; X a hyperbolic curve of type (1, 1) over a
ﬁeld k of characteric zero; C a hyperbolic orbicurve of type (1, l-tors)± [cf. [EtTh],
Deﬁnition 2.1] over k, whose k-core C [cf. [CanLift], Remark 2.1.1; [EtTh], the
discussion at the beginning of §2] also forms a k-core of X. Thus, C determines,
def

up to k-isomorphism, a hyperbolic orbicurve X = C ×C X of type (1, l-tors) [cf.
[EtTh], Deﬁnition 2.1] over k. Moreover, if we write Gk for the absolute Galois
group of k [relative to an appropriate choice of basepoint], Π(−) for the arithmetic
fundamental group of a geometrically connected, geometrically normal, generically
scheme-like k-algebraic stack of ﬁnite type “(−)” [i.e., the étale fundamental group
π1 ((−))], and Δ(−) for the geometric fundamental group of “(−)” [i.e., the kernel
of the natural surjection Π(−)  Gk ], then we obtain natural cartesian diagrams

of ﬁnite étale coverings of hyperbolic orbicurves and open immersions of proﬁnite
groups. Finally, let us make the following assumption:
(∗) The natural action of Gk on Δab
X ⊗ (Z/lZ) [where the superscript “ab”
denotes the abelianization] is trivial.
Next, let  be a nonzero cusp of C — i.e., a cusp that arises from a nonzero
element of the quotient “Q” that appears in the deﬁnition of a “hyperbolic orbicurve
of type (1, l-tors)± ” given in [EtTh], Deﬁnition 2.1. Write 0 for the unique “zero
cusp” [i.e., “non-nonzero cusp”] of X;  ,  for the two cusps of X that lie over ;
and
ΔX  Δab
X ⊗ (Z/lZ)  Δ
for the quotient of Δab
X ⊗ (Z/lZ) by the images of the inertia groups of all nonzero
 
cusps =  ,  of X. Thus, we obtain a natural exact sequence
0 −→ I × I

−→ Δ

— where we write E for the genus one compactiﬁcation of X, and I , I for
the respective images in Δ of the inertia groups of the cusps  ,  [so we have
noncanonical isomorphisms I ∼
= Z/lZ ∼
= I ].
Next, let us observe that Gk , Gal(X/C) (∼
= Z/2Z) act naturally on the above
exact sequence. Write ι ∈ Gal(X/C) for the unique nontrivial element. Then ι
induces an isomorphism I ∼
= I ; if we use this isomorphism to identify I , I ,
then one veriﬁes immediately that ι acts on the term “I × I ” of the above exact
sequence by switching the two factors. Moreover, one veriﬁes immediately that ι

38

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

acts on ΔE ⊗(Z/lZ) via multiplication by −1. In particular, since l is odd, it follows
that the action by ι on Δ determines a decomposition into eigenspaces

— i.e., where ι acts on Δ+
 (respectively, Δ ) by multiplication by +1 (respectively,

ΠX  JX ;

determine isomorphisms I → Δ+

on Δ clearly commutes with the action of ι, we thus conclude that the quotient
ΔX  Δ  Δ+
 determines quotients

— where the surjections ΠX  Gk , ΠC  Gk induce natural exact sequences
+
1 → Δ+
 → JX → Gk → 1, 1 → Δ × Gal(X/C) → JC → Gk → 1; we have a
natural inclusion JX → JC .
Next, let us consider the cusp “2” of C — i.e., the cusp whose inverse images in
X correspond to the points of E obtained by multiplying  ,  by 2, relative to the
group law of the elliptic curve determined by the pair (X, 0 ). Since 2 = ±1 (mod l)
[a consequence of our assumption that l ≥ 5], it follows that the decomposition group
associated to this cusp “2” determines a section
σ : G k → JC
of the natural surjection JC  Gk . Here, we note that although, a priori, σ is only
determined by 2 up to composition with an inner automorphism of JC determined
by an element of Δ+
 × Gal(X/C), in fact, since [in light of the assumption (∗)!]
the natural [outer] action of Gk on Δ+
 × Gal(X/C) is trivial, we conclude that σ
is completely determined by 2, and that the subgroup Im(σ) ⊆ JC determined by
the image of σ is normal in JC . Moreover, by considering the decomposition groups
associated to the cusps of X lying over 2, we conclude that Im(σ) lies inside the
subgroup JX ⊆ JC . Thus, the subgroups Im(σ) ⊆ JX , Im(σ) × Gal(X/C) ⊆ JC

Corollary 1.2.
(Characteristic Nature of Coverings) Suppose that k is
an NF or an MLF. Then there exists a functorial group-theoretic algorithm
[cf. [AbsTopIII], Remark 1.9.8, for more on the meaning of this terminology] to
reconstruct

Proof. For simplicity, we consider the non-resp’d case; the resp’d case is entirely
similar [but slightly easier]. The argument is similar to the arguments applied in
[EtTh], Proposition 1.8; [EtTh], Proposition 2.4. First, we recall that Π−
X , ΠX , and
→
ΠC are slim [cf., e.g., [AbsTopI], Proposition 2.3, (ii)], hence embed naturally into
Aut(Π−
X ), and that one may recover the subgroup Δ−

[AbsTopI], Theorem 2.6, (v), (vi). Next, we recall that the algorithms of [AbsTopII],
Corollary 3.3, (i), (ii) — which are applicable in light of [AbsTopI], Example 4.8
— allow one to reconstruct ΠC [together with the natural inclusion Π−
X → ΠC ],

as well as the subgroups ΔX ⊆ ΔC ⊆ ΠC . In particular, l may be recovered via
the formula l2 = [ΔX : ΔX ] · [ΔX : Δ−

Remark 1.2.2. The group-theoretic algorithm for reconstructing the decomposition groups of cusps given [AbsTopI], Lemma 4.5 — which is based on the argument
given in the proof of [AbsAnab], Lemma 1.3.9 — contains some minor, inessential
inaccuracies. In light of the importance of this group-theoretic algorithm for the
theory of the present series of papers, we thus pause to discuss how these inaccuracies may be amended.
(i) The ﬁnal portion [beginning with the third sentence] of the second paragraph
of the proof of [AbsAnab], Lemma 1.3.9, should be replaced by the following text:
Since ri may be recovered group-theoretically, given any ﬁnite étale coverings
Z i → Vi → X i
such that Zi is cyclic [hence Galois], of degree a power of l, over Vi ,
one may determine group-theoretically whether or not Zi → Vi is totally
ramiﬁed [i.e., at some point of Zi ], since this condition is easily veriﬁed
to be equivalent to the condition that the covering Zi → Vi admit a
factorization Zi → Wi → Vi , where Wi → Vi is ﬁnite étale of degree l,
and rWi < l · rVi . Moreover, this group-theoreticity of the condition that a
cyclic covering be totally ramiﬁed extends immediately to the case of pro-l
cyclic coverings Zi → Vi . Thus, by Lemma 1.3.7, we conclude that the
inertia groups of cusps in (ΔXi )(l) [i.e., the maximal pro-l quotient of ΔXi ]
may be characterized [group-theoretically!] as the maximal subgroups of
(ΔXi )(l) that correspond to [proﬁnite] coverings satisfying this condition.
(ii) The ﬁnal portion [beginning with the third sentence] of the statement of
[AbsTopI], Lemma 4.5, (iv), should be replaced by the following text:
Then the decomposition groups of cusps ⊆ H ∗ may be characterized [“group-theoretically”] as the maximal closed subgroups I ⊆ H ∗
isomorphic to Zl which satisfy the following condition: We have

in Remark 1.2.2 are closely related to certain minor, inessential inaccuracies in
the theory of [CombGC]. Thus, it is of interest, in the context of the discussion of
Remark 1.2.2, to pause to discuss how these inaccuracies may be amended. These
inaccuracies arise in the arguments applied in [CombGC], Deﬁnition 1.4, (v), (vi),
and [CombGC], Remarks 1.4.2, 1.4.3, and 1.4.4, to prove [CombGC], Theorem
1.6. These arguments are formulated in a somewhat confusing way and should be
modiﬁed as follows:
(i) First of all, we remark that in [CombGC], as well as in the following discussion, a “Galois” ﬁnite étale covering is to be understood as being connected.
(ii) In the second sentence of [CombGC], Deﬁnition 1.4, (v), the cuspidal and
nodal cases of the notion of a purely totally ramiﬁed covering are in fact unnecessary
and may be deleted. Also, the terminology introduced in [CombGC], Deﬁnition
1.4, (vi), concerning ﬁnite étale coverings that descend is unnecessary and may be
deleted.
(iii) The text of [CombGC], Remark 1.4.2, should be replaced by the following
text:
Let G  → G be a Galois ﬁnite étale covering of degree a positive power of
l, where G is of pro-Σ PSC-type, Σ = {l}. Then one veriﬁes immediately
that, if we assume further that the covering G  → G is cyclic, then G  → G
is cuspidally totally ramiﬁed if and only if the inequality
r(G  ) < l · r(G)
— where we write G  → G  → G for the unique [up to isomorphism]
factorization of the ﬁnite étale covering G  → G as a composite of ﬁnite
étale coverings such that G  → G is of degree l — is satisﬁed. Suppose

further that G  → G is a [not necessarily cyclic!] Πunr
G -covering [so n(G ) =


deg(G /G) · n(G)]. Then one veriﬁes immediately that G → G is verticially
purely totally ramiﬁed if and only if the equality
i(G  ) = deg(G  /G) · (i(G) − 1) + 1
is satisﬁed. Also, we observe that this last inequality is equivalent to the
following equality involving the expression “i(. . . ) − n(. . . )” [cf. Remark
1.1.3]:
i(G  ) − n(G  ) = deg(G  /G) · (i(G) − n(G) − 1) + 1
(iv) The text of [CombGC], Remark 1.4.3, should be replaced by the following
text:
Suppose that G is of pro-Σ PSC-type, Σ = {l}. Then one veriﬁes immediately that the cuspidal edge-like subgroups of ΠG may be characterized as
the maximal [cf. Proposition 1.2, (i)] closed subgroups A ⊆ ΠG isomorphic
to Zl which satisfy the following condition:
for every characteristic open subgroup ΠG  ⊆ ΠG , if we write
G  → G  → G for the ﬁnite étale coverings corresponding to

42

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
def

ΠG  ⊆ ΠG  = A · ΠG  ⊆ ΠG , then the cyclic ﬁnite étale covering
G  → G  is cuspidally totally ramiﬁed.
[Indeed, the necessity of this characterization is immediate from the definitions; the suﬃciency of this characterization follows by observing that
since the set of cusps of a ﬁnite étale covering of G is always ﬁnite, the
above condition implies that there exists a compatible system of cusps of
the various G  that arise, each of which is stabilized by the action of A.] On
the other hand, in order to characterize the unramiﬁed verticial subgroups
of Πunr
G , it suﬃces — by considering stabilizers of vertices of underlying
semi-graphs of ﬁnite étale Πunr
G -coverings of G — to give a functorial characterization of the set of vertices of G [i.e., which may also be applied
to ﬁnite étale Πunr
G -coverings of G]. This may be done, for sturdy G, as
follows. Write MGunr for the abelianization of Πunr
G . For each vertex v of
the underlying semi-graph G of G, write MGunr [v] ⊆ MGunr for the image of
unr
associthe Πunr
G -conjugacy class of unramiﬁed verticial subgroups of ΠG
ated to v. Then one veriﬁes immediately, by constructing suitable abelian
Πunr
G -coverings of G via suitable gluing operations [i.e., as in the proof of
Proposition 1.2], that the inclusions MGunr [v] ⊆ MGunr determine a split
injection

MGunr [v] → MGunr
v

[where v ranges over the vertices of G], whose image we denote by MGunr-vert ⊆
MGunr . Now we consider elementary abelian quotients
φ : MGunr  Q
— i.e., where Q is an elementary abelian group. We identify such quotients
whenever their kernels coincide and order such quotients by means of the
relation of “domination” [i.e., inclusion of kernels]. Then one veriﬁes immediately that such a quotient φ : MGunr  Q corresponds to a verticially
purely totally ramiﬁed covering of G if and only if there exists a vertex v
of G such that φ(MGunr [v]) = Q, φ(MGunr [v  ]) = 0 for all vertices v  = v of
G. In particular, one concludes immediately that
the elementary abelian quotients φ : MGunr  Q whose restriction to MGunr-vert surjects onto Q and has the same kernel as the
quotient
MGunr-vert  MGunr [v]  MGunr [v] ⊗ Fl
— where the ﬁrst “” is the natural projection; the second “”
is given by reduction modulo l — may be characterized as the
maximal quotients [i.e., relative to the relation of domination]
among those elementary abelian quotients of MGunr that correspond to verticially purely totally ramiﬁed coverings of G.
Thus, since G is sturdy, the set of vertices of G may be characterized as
the set of [nontrivial!] quotients MGunr-vert  MGunr [v] ⊗ Fl .

(v) The text of [CombGC], Remark 1.4.4, should be replaced by the following
text:
Suppose that G is of pro-Σ PSC-type, where Σ = {l}, and that G is
noncuspidal. Then, in the spirit of the cuspidal portion of Remark 1.4.3,
we observe the following: One veriﬁes immediately that the nodal edge-like
subgroups of ΠG may be characterized as the maximal [cf. Proposition 1.2,
(i)] closed subgroups A ⊆ ΠG isomorphic to Zl which satisfy the following
condition:
for every characteristic open subgroup ΠG  ⊆ ΠG , if we write
G  → G  → G for the ﬁnite étale coverings corresponding to
def
ΠG  ⊆ ΠG  = A · ΠG  ⊆ ΠG , then the cyclic ﬁnite étale covering
G  → G  is nodally totally ramiﬁed.
Here, we note further that [one veriﬁes immediately that] the ﬁnite étale
covering G  → G  is nodally totally ramiﬁed if and only if it is module-wise
nodal.
(vi) The text of the second paragraph of the proof of [CombGC], Theorem 1.6,
should be replaced by the following text [which may be thought as being appended
to the end of the ﬁrst paragraph of the proof of [CombGC], Theorem 1.6]:
Then the fact that α is group-theoretically cuspidal follows formally from
the characterization of cuspidal edge-like subgroups given in Remark 1.4.3
and the characterization of cuspidally totally ramiﬁed cyclic ﬁnite étale
coverings given in Remark 1.4.2.
(vii) The text of the ﬁnal paragraph of the proof of [CombGC], Theorem 1.6,
should be replaced by the following text [which may be thought of as a sort of
“easy version” of the argument given in the proof of the implication “(iii) =⇒ (i)”
of [CbTpII], Proposition 1.5]:
Finally, we consider assertion (iii). Suﬃciency is immediate. On the
other hand, necessity follows formally from the characterization of unramiﬁed verticial subgroups given in Remark 1.4.3 and the characterization
of verticially purely totally ramiﬁed ﬁnite étale coverings given in Remark
1.4.2.

Section 2: Complements on Tempered Coverings
In the present §2, we discuss certain routine complements — which will be of
use in the present series of papers — to the theory of tempered coverings of graphs
of anabelioids, as developed in [SemiAnbd], §3 [cf. also the closely related theory
of [CombGC]].
Let Σ, Σ be nonempty sets of prime numbers such that Σ ⊆ Σ;
G
a semi-graph of anabelioids of pro-Σ PSC-type [cf. [CombGC], Deﬁnition 1.1, (i)],
whose underlying semi-graph we denote by G. Write Πtp
G for the tempered fundamental group of G [cf. the discussion preceding [SemiAnbd], Proposition 3.6, as
well as Remark 2.5.3, (i), (T6), of the present paper] and ΠG for the pro-Σ [i.e.,
maximal pro-Σ quotient of the proﬁnite] fundamental group of G [cf. the discussion
preceding [SemiAnbd], Deﬁnition 2.2] — both taken with respect to appropriate
choices of basepoints. Thus, since discrete free groups of ﬁnite rank inject into
their pro-l completions for any prime number l [cf., e.g., [RZ], Proposition 3.3.15],
it follows that we have a natural injection [cf. [SemiAnbd], Proposition 3.6, (iii), as
well as Remark 2.5.3, (ii), (E7), of the present paper, when Σ = Primes; the proof
in the case of arbitrary Σ is entirely similar]
Πtp
G → ΠG
that we shall use to regard Πtp
G as a subgroup of ΠG and ΠG as the pro-Σ completion
tp
of ΠG .
Next, let
H
be the semi-graph of anabelioids associated to a connected sub-semi-graph H ⊆
G. One veriﬁes immediately that the restriction of H to the maximal subgraph
[cf. the discussion at the beginning of [SemiAnbd], §1] of H coincides with the
restriction to the maximal subgraph of the underlying semi-graph of some semigraph of anabelioids of pro-Σ PSC-type. That is to say, roughly speaking, up to the
possible omission of some of the cuspidal edges, H “is” a semi-graph of anabelioids
of pro-Σ PSC-type. In particular, since the omission of cuspidal edges clearly does
not aﬀect either the tempered or pro-Σ fundamental groups, we shall apply the
notation introduced above for “G” to H. We thus obtain a natural commutative
diagram

of [outer] inclusions [cf. [SemiAnbd], Proposition 2.5, (i), when Σ = Primes; in
light of the well-known structure of fundamental groups of hyperbolic Riemann
surfaces of ﬁnite type, a similar proof may be given in the case of arbitrary Σ, i.e.,

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY I

by considering successive composites of ﬁnite étale Galois coverings that restrict to
trivial coverings over the closed edges and ﬁnite étale abelian [Galois] coverings obtained by gluing together suitable abelian coverings] of topological groups, which we
shall use to regard all of the groups in the diagram as subgroups of ΠG . In partictp
ular, one may think of Πtp
H (respectively, ΠH ) as the decomposition subgroup in ΠG
(respectively, ΠG ) [which is well-deﬁned up to Πtp
G - (respectively, ΠG -)conjugacy]
associated to the sub-semi-graph H.
The following result is the central technical result underlying the theory of the
present §2.
Proposition 2.1.
(Proﬁnite Conjugates of Nontrivial Compact Subgroups) In the notation of the above discussion, let Λ ⊆ Πtp
G be a nontrivial
−1
compact subgroup, γ ∈ ΠG an element such that γ · Λ · γ ⊆ Πtp
G [or, equivatp
tp
−1
lently, Λ ⊆ γ · ΠG · γ]. Then γ ∈ ΠG .
Proof. Write Γ for the “pro-Σ semi-graph” associated to the universal pro-Σ étale
covering of G [i.e., the covering corresponding to the subgroup {1} ⊆ ΠG ]; Γtp for
the “pro-semi-graph” associated to the universal tempered covering of G [i.e., the
covering corresponding to the subgroup {1} ⊆ Πtp
G ]. Thus, we have a natural dense
tp
map Γ → Γ. Let us refer to a [“pro-”]vertex of Γ that occurs as the image of
a [“pro-”]vertex of Γtp as tempered. Since Λ, γ · Λ · γ −1 are compact subgroups of
Πtp
G , it follows from [SemiAnbd], Theorem 3.7, (iii) [cf. also [SemiAnbd], Example
3.10, as well as Remark 2.5.3, (ii), (E7), of the present paper], that there exist

−1
verticial subgroups Λ , Λ ⊆ Πtp
⊆ Λ . Thus, Λ ,
G such that Λ ⊆ Λ , γ · Λ · γ
Λ correspondto tempered vertices v  , v  of Γ; {1} = γ · Λ · γ −1 ⊆ γ · Λ · γ −1 , so
Λ = {1}. Since Λ , γ · Λ · γ −1 are both verticial subgroups of
(γ · Λ · γ −1 )
ΠG , it thus follows either from [AbsTopII], Proposition 1.3, (iv), or from [NodNon],
Proposition 3.9, (i), that the corresponding vertices v  , (v  )γ of Γ are either equal
or adjacent. In particular, since v  is tempered, we thus conclude that (v  )γ is
tempered. Thus, v  , (v  )γ are tempered, so γ ∈ Πtp
G , as desired. 
Next, relative to the notation “C”, “N ” and related terminology concerning
commensurators and normalizers discussed, for instance, in [SemiAnbd], §0; [CombGC], §0, we have the following result.
Proposition 2.2.
(Commensurators of Decomposition Subgroups Associated to Sub-semi-graphs) In the notation of the above discussion, ΠH (respectively, Πtp
H ) is commensurably terminal in ΠG (respectively, ΠG [hence, also
tp
in ΠG ]). In particular, Πtp
G is commensurably terminal in ΠG .
Proof. First, let us observe that by allowing, in Proposition 2.1, Λ to range over the
open subgroups of any verticial [hence, in particular, nontrivial compact!] subgroup
of Πtp
G , we conclude from Proposition 2.1 that
Πtp
G is commensurably terminal in ΠG

46

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

— cf. Remark 2.2.2 below. In particular, by applying this fact to H [cf. the discussion preceding Proposition 2.1], we conclude that Πtp
H is commensurably terminal
in ΠH . Next, let us observe that it is immediate from the deﬁnitions that
tp

G

G

G

tp
[where we think of ΠH , ΠG , respectively, as the pro-Σ completions of Πtp
H , ΠG ].
On the other hand, by the evident pro-Σ analogue of [SemiAnbd], Corollary 2.7,
(i) [cf. also the argument involving gluing of abelian coverings in the discussion
preceding Proposition 2.1], we have CΠ (ΠH ) = ΠH . Thus, by the commensurable
G

terminality of Πtp
H in ΠH , we conclude that
tp
tp
tp
Πtp
H ⊆ CΠ (ΠH ) ⊆ CΠ (ΠH ) = ΠH

— as desired. 
Remark 2.2.1. It follows immediately from the theory of [SemiAnbd] [cf., e.g.,
[SemiAnbd], Corollary 2.7, (i)] that, in fact, Propositions 2.1 and 2.2 can be proven
for much more general semi-graphs of anabelioids G than the sort of G that appears
in the above discussion. We leave the routine details of such generalizations to the
interested reader.
Remark 2.2.2. Recall that when Σ = Primes, the fact that
Πtp
G is normally terminal in ΠG
may also be derived from the fact that any nonabelian ﬁnitely generated free group
is normally terminal [cf. [André], Lemma 3.2.1; [SemiAnbd], Lemma 6.1, (i)] in its
proﬁnite completion. In particular, the proof of the commensurable terminality of
Πtp
G in ΠG that is given in the proof of Proposition 2.2 may be thought of as a new
proof of this normal terminality that does not require one to invoke [André], Lemma
3.2.1, which is essentially an immediate consequence of the rather diﬃcult conjugacy
separability result given in [Stb1], Theorem 1. This relation of Proposition 2.1 to
the theory of [Stb1] is interesting in light of the discrete analogue given in Theorem
2.6 below of [the “tempered version of Theorem 2.6” constituted by] Proposition
2.4 [which is essentially a formal consequence of Proposition 2.1].

pro-Σ [i.e., maximal pro-Σ quotient of the proﬁnite] fundamental group of Xk ; ΠX
for the quotient of the proﬁnite fundamental group of X by the subgroup of the
proﬁnite fundamental group of Xk that determines the quotient ΔX . Thus, since
discrete free groups of ﬁnite rank inject into their pro-l completions for any prime

tp
completion of Δtp
X ; ΠX is generated by the images of ΠX and ΔX .
Now suppose that the residue characteristic p of k is not contained in Σ;
that the semi-graph of anabelioids G of the above discussion is the pro-Σ semi-graph
of anabelioids associated to the geometric special ﬁber of the stable model X of X
over Ok [cf., e.g., [SemiAnbd], Example 3.10]; and that the sub-semi-graph H ⊆ G

(vi) Let
Ix ⊆ Δtp
X (respectively, Ix ⊆ ΔX )
be an inertia group associated to a cusp x of X. Write ξ for the cusp of the stable
model X corresponding to x. Then the following conditions are equivalent:
tp
(a) Ix lies in a Δtp
X - (respectively, ΔX -) conjugate of ΔX,H (respectively,

ΔX,H );
(b) ξ meets an irreducible component of the special ﬁber of X that is contained in H.
Proof. Assertion (i) follows immediately from Proposition 2.2. Assertion (ii) follows immediately from the deﬁnitions of the various tempered fundamental groups
involved, together with the following elementary observation: If G  F is a surjection of ﬁnitely generated free discrete groups, which induces a surjection G  F
between the respective pro-Σ completions [so, since discrete free groups of ﬁnite
rank inject into their pro-l completions for any prime number l [cf., e.g., [RZ],
Proposition 3.3.15], we think of G and F as subgroups of G and F , respectively],
def

def

then H = Ker(G  F ) is dense in H = Ker(G  F ), relative to the pro-Σ topology of G. Indeed, let ι : F → G be a section of the given surjection G  F [which
exists since F is free]. Then if {gi }i∈N is a sequence of elements of G that converges,
in the pro-Σ topology of G, to a given element h ∈ H, and maps to a sequence of
elements {fi }i∈N of F [which necessarily converges, in the pro-Σ topology of F , to
the identity element 1 ∈ F ], then one veriﬁes immediately that {gi · ι(fi )−1 }i∈N is
a sequence of elements of H that converges, in the pro-Σ topology of G, to h. This
completes the proof of the observation and hence of assertion (ii).
Next, we consider assertion (iii). In the following, we give, in eﬀect, two distinct
proofs of the slimness of ΔX,H : one is elementary, but requires one to assume that
condition (a) holds; the other depends on the highly nontrivial theory of [Tama2]
and requires one to assume that condition (b) holds. If condition (a) holds, then

def
let us set Σ∗ = Σ {l}. If condition (b) holds, but condition (a) does not hold [so

Σ = Primes = Σ {p}], then let us set Σ∗ = Σ. Thus, in either case, p ∈ Σ∗ , and
Σ ⊆ Σ∗ ⊆ Σ.

def
Let J ⊆ ΔX be a normal open subgroup. Write JH = J ΔX,H ; J  J ∗ for
the maximal pro-Σ∗ quotient; JH∗ ⊆ J ∗ for the image of JH in J ∗ . Now suppose that
α ∈ ΔX,H commutes with JH . Let v be a vertex of the dual graph of the geometric
special ﬁber of a stable model XJ of the covering XJ of Xk determined by J. Write
Jv ⊆ J for the decomposition group [well-deﬁned up to conjugation in J] associated
to v; Jv∗ ⊆ J ∗ for the image of Jv in J ∗ . Then let us observe that
(†) there exists an open subgroup J0 ⊆ ΔX which is independent of J, v,
and α such
 ∗that if ∗J ⊆ J0 , then for arbitrary v [and α] as above, it holds
∗
that Jv JH (⊆ J ) is inﬁnite and nonabelian.
Indeed, suppose that condition (a) holds. Now it follows immediately from the
deﬁnitions that the image of the homomorphism Jv ⊆ J ⊆ ΔX  ΠG is pro-Σ; in

Riemann surface, hence [as is well-known] is inﬁnite and nonabelian [so we may
def

take J0 = ΔX ]. Now suppose that condition (b) holds, but condition (a) does
not hold. Then it follows immediately from [Tama2], Theorem 0.2, (v), that, for
an appropriate choice of J0 , if J ⊆ J0 , then every v corresponds to an irreducible
component that either maps to a point in X or contains a node that maps to a
smooth point of X . In particular, it follows that for every choice of v, there exists
at least one pro-Σ, torsion-free, pro-cyclic subgroup F ⊆ Jv that lies in Ker(Jv ⊆

J ⊆ ΔX  ΠG ) ⊆ Jv JHand, moreover, maps injectively into J ∗ . Thus, we
obtain an injection F → Jv∗ JH∗ ; a similar statement holds when F is replaced by
any Jv -conjugate of F . Moreover, it follows from the well-known structure of the
pro-Σ completion of the fundamental group of a hyperbolic Riemann surface [such
the Jv -conjugates of such a group F topologically generate
as Jv∗ ] that the image of 
a closed subgroup of Jv∗ JH∗ which is inﬁnite and nonabelian. This completes the
proof of (†).
Next, let us observe that it follows by applying either [AbsTopII], Proposition
1.3,(iv), or [NodNon], Proposition 3.9, (i), to the variousΔX -conjugates in J ∗ of
Jv∗ JH∗ as in (†) that the fact that α commutes with Jv∗ JH∗ implies that α ﬁxes
v. If condition (a) holds, then the fact that conjugation by αon the maximal pro-l
quotient of Jv [which, as we saw above, is a quotient of Jv∗ JH∗ ] is trivial implies
[cf. the argument concerning the inertia group “Iv ⊆ Dv ” in the latter portion
of the proof of [SemiAnbd], Corollary 3.11] that α not only ﬁxes v, but also acts
trivially on the irreducible component of the special ﬁber of XJ determined by v;
since v as in (†) is arbitrary, we thus conclude that α acts on the abelianization
(J ∗ )ab of J ∗ as a unipotent automorphism of ﬁnite order, hence that α acts trivially
on (J ∗ )ab ; since J as in (†) is arbitrary, we thus conclude [cf., e.g., the proof of
[Conﬁg], Proposition 1.4] that α is the identity element, as desired. Now suppose
that condition (b) holds, but condition (a) does not hold. Then since J and v as
in (†) are arbitrary, we thus conclude again from [Tama2], Theorem 0.2, (v), that
α ﬁxes not only v, but also every closed point on the irreducible component of the
special ﬁber of XJ determined by v, hence that α acts trivially on this irreducible
component. Again since J and v as in (†) are arbitrary, we thus conclude that
α is the identity element, as desired. This completes the proof of assertion (iii).
In light of the exact sequences of assertion (iii), assertion (iv) follows immediately
from assertion (i). Assertion (vi) follows immediately from a similar argument to
the argument applied in the proof of [CombGC], Proposition 1.5, (i), by passing to
pro-Σ completions.
Finally, it follows immediately from the deﬁnitions of the various tempered
fundamental groups involved that to verify assertion (v), it suﬃces to verify the
following analogue of assertion (v) for a nonabelian ﬁnitely generated free discrete
group G: for any ﬁnitely generated subgroup F ⊆ G, if we use the notation “∧”

to denote the pro-Σ completion, then F G = F . But to verify this assertion
concerning G, it follows immediately from [SemiAnbd], Corollary 1.6, (ii), that we
may assume without loss of generality that the inclusion F ⊆ G admits a splitting
G  F [i.e., such that the composite F → G  F is the identity on F ], in which

50


case the desired equality “F G = F ” follows immediately. This completes the
proof of assertion (v), and hence of Corollary 2.3. 
Next, we observe the following arithmetic analogue of Proposition 2.1.
Proposition 2.4. (Proﬁnite Conjugates of Nontrivial Arithmetic Compact Subgroups) In the notation of the above discussion:
(i) Let Λ ⊆ Δtp
X be a nontrivial pro-Σ compact subgroup, γ ∈ ΠX an
−1
· Δtp
element such that γ · Λ · γ −1 ⊆ Δtp
X [or, equivalently, Λ ⊆ γ
X · γ]. Then
tp
γ ∈ ΠX .
(ii) Suppose that Σ = Primes. Let Λ ⊆ Πtp
X be a [nontrivial] compact
subgroup whose image in Gk is open, γ ∈ ΠX an element such that γ · Λ · γ −1 ⊆
tp
−1
Πtp
· Πtp
X [or, equivalently, Λ ⊆ γ
X · γ]. Then γ ∈ ΠX .
tp
(iii) Δtp
X (respectively, ΠX ) is commensurably terminal in ΔX (respectively, ΠX ).

Proof. First, we consider assertion (i). We begin by observing that since [as is
well-known — cf., e.g., [Conﬁg], Remark 1.2.2] ΔX is strongly torsion-free, it follows
that there exists a ﬁnite index characteristic open subgroup J ⊆ Δtp
X such that, if
we write GJ for the pro-Σ semi-graph of anabelioids associated to the special ﬁber of
the stable model [i.e., over the ring of integers Ok of k] of the ﬁnite étale covering of

X ×k k determined by J, then J Λ has nontrivial image in the pro-Σ completion
of the abelianization of J, hence in Πtp
GJ [since, as is well-known, our assumption
that p ∈
/ Σ implies that the surjection J  Πtp
GJ induces an isomorphism between
the pro-Σ completions of the respective abelianizations]. Since the quotient Πtp
X
surjects onto Gk , and J is open of ﬁnite index in Δtp
,
we
may
assume
without
loss
X

of generality that γ lies in the closure J of J in ΠX . Since J Λ has nontrivial
image in Πtp
GJ , it thus follows from Proposition 2.1 [applied to GJ ] that the image
of γ via the natural surjection on pro-Σ completions J  ΠGJ lies in Πtp
GJ . Since,
tp
by allowing J to vary, ΠX (respectively, ΠX ) may be written as an inverse limit of
tp
the topological groups Πtp
X /Ker(J  ΠGJ ) (respectively, ΠX /Ker(J  ΠGJ )), we
thus conclude that [the original] γ lies in Πtp
X , as desired.
Next, we consider assertion (ii). First, let us observe that it follows from a similar argument to the argument applied to prove Proposition 2.1 — where, instead of
applying [SemiAnbd], Theorem 3.7, (iii), we apply its arithmetic analogue, namely,
[SemiAnbd], Theorem 5.4, (ii); [SemiAnbd], Example 5.6 [cf. also Remark 2.5.3,
(ii), (E5), (E7), of the present paper] — that the image of γ in ΠX /Ker(ΔX  ΠG ∗ )
tp
tp
lies in Πtp
X /Ker(ΔX  ΠG ∗ ), where [by invoking the hypothesis that Σ = Primes]
we take G ∗ to be a semi-graph of anabelioids as in [SemiAnbd], Example 5.6, i.e.,
the semi-graph of anabelioids whose ﬁnite étale coverings correspond to arbitrary
admissible coverings of the geometric special ﬁber of the stable model X . Here, we
note that when one applies either [AbsTopII], Proposition 1.3, (iv), or [NodNon],

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY I

51

Proposition 3.9, (i) — after, say, restricting the outer action of Gk on Πtp
G ∗ to a
closed pro-Σ subgroup of the inertia group Ik of Gk that maps isomorphically onto
the maximal pro-Σ quotient of Ik — to the vertices “v  ”, “(v  )γ ”, one may only
conclude that these two vertices either coincide, are adjacent, or admit a common
adjacent vertex; but this is still suﬃcient to conclude the temperedness of “(v  )γ ”
from that of “v  ”. Now [just as in the proof of assertion (i)] by applying [the evident
tp
tp
analogue of] this observation to the quotients Πtp
X  ΠX /Ker(J  ΠG ∗ ) — where
J

∗
J ⊆ Δtp
X is a ﬁnite index characteristic open subgroup, and GJ is the semi-graph of
anabelioids whose ﬁnite étale coverings correspond to arbitrary admissible coverings
of the special ﬁber of the stable model over Ok of the ﬁnite étale covering of X ×k k
determined by J — we conclude that γ ∈ Πtp
X , as desired.

Finally, we consider assertion (iii). Just as in the proof of Proposition 2.2, the
commensurable terminality of Δtp
X in ΔX follows immediately from assertion (i),
by allowing, in assertion (i), Λ to range over the open subgroups of a pro-Σ Sylow
subgroup of a decomposition group ⊆ Δtp
X associated to an irreducible component
of the special ﬁber of X . The commensurable terminality of Πtp
X in ΠX then follows
tp
immediately from the commensurable terminality of ΔX in ΔX . 
Remark 2.4.1. Thus, when Σ = Primes, the proof given above of Proposition
2.4, (iii), yields a new proof of [André], Corollary 6.2.2 [cf. also [SemiAnbd], Lemma
6.1, (ii), (iii)] which is independent of [André], Lemma 3.2.1, hence also of [Stb1],
Theorem 1 [cf. the discussion of Remark 2.2.2].
Corollary 2.5. (Proﬁnite Conjugates of Tempered Decomposition and
Inertia Groups) In the notation of the above discussion, suppose further that
Σ = Primes. Then every decomposition group in ΠX (respectively, inertia
group in ΠX ) associated to a closed point or cusp of X (respectively, to a cusp of
tp
X) is contained in Πtp
X if and only if it is a decomposition group in ΠX (respectively,
tp
inertia group in ΠX ) associated to a closed point or cusp of X (respectively, to a
cusp of X). Moreover, a ΠX -conjugate of Πtp
X contains a decomposition group in
tp
tp
ΠX (respectively, inertia group in ΠX ) associated to a closed point or cusp of X
(respectively, to a cusp of X) if and only if it is equal to Πtp
X.
tp
Let Dx ⊆ Πtp
X be the decomposition group in ΠX associated to a closed

def
point or cusp x of X; Ix = Dx Δtp
X . Then the decomposition groups of ΠX
associated to x are precisely the ΠX -conjugates of Dx ; the decomposition groups
tp
of Πtp
X associated to x are precisely the ΠX -conjugates of Dx . Since Dx is compact
and surjects onto an open subgroup of Gk , it thus follows from Proposition 2.4,
(ii), that a ΠX -conjugate of Dx is contained in Πtp
X if and only if it is, in fact, a
tp
ΠX -conjugate of Dx , and that a ΠX -conjugate of Πtp
X contains Dx if and only if
tp
it is, in fact, equal to ΠX . In a similar vein, when x is a cusp of X [so Ix ∼
= Z],
it follows — i.e., by applying Proposition 2.4, (i), to the unique maximal pro-Σ
subgroup of Ix — that a ΠX -conjugate of Ix is contained in Πtp
X if and only if it is,
tp
tp
in fact, a ΠX -conjugate of Ix , and that a ΠX -conjugate of ΠX contains Ix if and
only if it is, in fact, equal to Πtp
X . This completes the proof of Corollary 2.5. 

Proof.

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

Remark 2.5.1. The content of Corollary 2.5 may be regarded as a sort of [very
weak!] version of the “Section Conjecture” of anabelian geometry — i.e., as the
assertion that certain sections of the tempered fundamental group [namely, those
that arise from geometric sections of the proﬁnite fundamental group] are geometric
as sections of the tempered fundamental group. This point of view is reminiscent
of the point of view of [SemiAnbd], Remark 6.9.1. Perhaps one way of summarizing
this circle of ideas is to state that one may think of
(i) the classiﬁcation of maximal compact subgroups of tempered fundamental
groups given in [SemiAnbd], Theorem 3.7, (iv); [SemiAnbd], Theorem 5.4,
(ii) [cf. also Remark 2.5.3, (ii), (E5), (E7), of the present paper], or, for
that matter,
(ii) the more elementary fact that “any ﬁnite group acting on a tree [without
inversion] ﬁxes at least one vertex” [cf. [SemiAnbd], Lemma 1.8, (ii)] from
which these results of [SemiAnbd] are derived
as a sort of combinatorial version of the Section Conjecture.
Remark 2.5.2. Ultimately, when we apply Corollary 2.5 in [IUTchII], it will
only be necessary to apply the portion of Corollary 2.5 that concerns inertia groups
of cusps, i.e., the portion whose proof only requires the use of Proposition 2.4,
(i), which is essentially an immediate consequence of Proposition 2.1. That is to
say, the theory developed in [IUTchII] [and indeed throughout the present series of
papers] will never require the application of Proposition 2.4, (ii), i.e., whose proof
depends on a slightly more complicated version of the proof of Proposition 2.1.
Remark 2.5.3. In light of the importance of the theory of [SemiAnbd] in the
present §2, we pause to discuss certain minor oversights on the part of the author
in the exposition of [SemiAnbd].
(i) Certain pathologies occur in the theory of tempered fundamental groups
if one does not impose suitable countability hypotheses. In order to discuss these
countability hypotheses, it will be convenient to introduce some terminology as
follows:
(T1) We shall say that a tempered group is Galois-countable if its topology admits a countable basis. We shall say that a connected temperoid
is Galois-countable if it arises from a Galois-countable tempered group.
We shall say that a temperoid is Galois-countable if it arises from a collection of Galois-countable connected temperoids. We shall say that a
connected quasi-temperoid is Galois-countable if it arises from a Galoiscountable connected temperoid. We shall say that a quasi-temperoid is
Galois-countable if it arises from a collection of Galois-countable connected
quasi-temperoids.
(T2) We shall say that a semi-graph of anabelioids G is Galois-countable if it
is countable, and, moreover, admits a countable collection of ﬁnite étale
coverings {Gi → G}i∈I such that for any ﬁnite étale covering H → G,
there exists an i ∈ I such that the base-changed covering H ×G Gi → Gi
splits over the constituent anabelioid associated to each component of [the
underlying semi-graph of] Gi .

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY I

53

(T3) We shall say that a semi-graph of anabelioids G is strictly coherent if it
is coherent [cf. [SemiAnbd], Deﬁnition 2.3, (iii)], and, moreover, each of
the proﬁnite groups associated to components c of [the underlying semigraph of] G [cf. the ﬁnal sentence of [SemiAnbd], Deﬁnition 2.3, (iii)] is
topologically generated by N generators, for some positive integer N that
is independent of c. In particular, it follows that if G is ﬁnite and coherent,
then it is strictly coherent.
(T4) One veriﬁes immediately that every strictly coherent, countable semigraph of anabelioids is Galois-countable.
(T5) One veriﬁes immediately that if, in [SemiAnbd], Remark 3.2.1, one assumes in addition that the temperoid X is Galois-countable, then it follows
that its associated tempered fundamental group π1temp (X ) is well-deﬁned
and Galois-countable.
(T6) One veriﬁes immediately that if, in the discussion of the paragraph
preceding [SemiAnbd], Proposition 3.6, one assumes in addition that the
semi-graph of anabelioids G is Galois-countable, then it follows that its
associated tempered fundamental group π1temp (G) and temperoid B temp (G)
are well-deﬁned and Galois-countable.
Here, we note that, in (T5) and (T6), the Galois-countability assumption is necessary in order to ensure that the index sets of “universal covering pro-objects”
implicit in the deﬁnition of the tempered fundamental group may to be taken to
be countable. This countability of the index sets involved implies that the various
objects that constitute such a universal covering pro-object admit a compatible system of basepoints, i.e., that the obstruction to the existence of such a compatible
system — which may be thought of as an element of a sort of “nonabelian R1 lim
←−”
— vanishes. In order to deﬁne the tempered fundamental group in an intrinsically meaningful fashion, it is necessary to know the existence of such a compatible
system of basepoints.
(ii) The eﬀects of the omission of Galois-countability hypotheses in [SemiAnbd],
§3 [cf. the discussion of (i)], on the remainder of [SemiAnbd], as well as on subsequent papers of the author, may be summarized as follows:
(E1) First of all, we observe that all topological subquotients of absolute Galois
groups of ﬁelds of countable cardinality are Galois-countable.
(E2) Also, we observe that if k is a ﬁeld whose absolute Galois group is Galoiscountable, and U is a nonempty open subscheme of a connected proper
k-scheme X that arises as the underlying scheme of a log scheme that is
log smooth over k [where we regard Spec(k) as equipped with the trivial
log structure], and whose interior is equal to U , then the tamely ramiﬁed
arithmetic fundamental group of U [i.e., that arises by considering ﬁnite
étale coverings of U with tame ramiﬁcation over the divisors that lie in
the complement of U in X] is itself Galois-countable [cf., e.g., [AbsTopI],
Proposition 2.2].
(E3) Next, we observe, with regard to [SemiAnbd], Examples 2.10, 3.10,
and 5.6, that the tempered groups and temperoids that appear in these
Examples are Galois-countable [cf. (E1), (E2)], while the semi-graphs of

54

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

anabelioids that appear in these Examples are strictly coherent [cf. item
(T3) of (i)], hence [cf. item (T4) of (i)] Galois-countable. In particular,
there is no eﬀect on the theory of objects discussed in these Examples.
(E4) It follows immediately from (E3) that there is no eﬀect on [SemiAnbd],
§6.
(E5) It follows immediately from items (T3), (T4) of (i), together with the
assumptions of ﬁniteness and coherence in the discussion of the paragraph immediately preceding [SemiAnbd], Deﬁnition 4.2, the assumption
of coherence in [SemiAnbd], Deﬁnition 5.1, (i), and the assumption of
[SemiAnbd], Deﬁnition 5.1, (i), (d), that there is no eﬀect on [SemiAnbd],
§4, §5. [Here, we note that since the notion of a tempered covering of a
semi-graph of anabelioids is only deﬁned in the case where the semi-graph
of anabelioids is countable, it is implicit in [SemiAnbd], Proposition 5.2,
and [SemiAnbd], Deﬁnition 5.3, that the semi-graphs of anabelioids under
consideration are countable.]
(E6) There is no eﬀect on [SemiAnbd], §1, §2, or the Appendix of [SemiAnbd],
since tempered fundamental groups are never discussed in these portions
of [SemiAnbd].
(E7)

In the Deﬁnitions/Propositions/Theorems/Corollaries of [SemiAnbd]
that are numbered 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, one must assume
that all tempered groups, temperoids, and semi-graphs of anabelioids that
appear are Galois-countable. On the other hand, it follows immediately
from (E1), (E2), and (E3) that there is no eﬀect on the remaining portions
of [SemiAnbd], §3.

(E8) In [QuCnf] and [FrdII], one must assume that all tempered groups and
[quasi-]temperoids that appear are Galois-countable.
(E9) There is no eﬀect on any papers of the author other than [SemiAnbd]
and the papers discussed in (E8).
(iii) The assertion stated in the second display of [SemiAnbd], Remark 2.4.2,
is false as stated. [The automorphisms of the semi-graphs of anabelioids in [SemiAnbd], Example 2.10, that arise from “Dehn twists” constitute a well-known counterexample to this assertion.] This assertion should be replaced by the following
slightly modiﬁed version of this assertion:
The isomorphism classes of the φv completely determine the isomorphism
class of each of the φe , as well as each isomorphism φb , up to composition with an automorphism of the composite 1-morphism of anabelioids
Ge → Hf → Hw that arises from an automorphism of the 1-morphism of
anabelioids Ge → Hf .
Also, in the discussion following this assertion [as well as the various places where
this discussion is applied, i.e., [SemiAnbd], Remark 3.5.2; the second paragraph of
[SemiAnbd], §4; [SemiAnbd], Deﬁnition 5.1, (iv)], it is necessary to assume further
that the semi-graphs of anabelioids that appear satisfy the condition that every
edge abuts to at least one vertex.

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY I

55

(iv) The phrase “is Galois” at the end of the ﬁrst sentence of the proof of
[SemiAnbd], Proposition 3.2, should read “is a countable coproduct of Galois objects”.
(v) In the ﬁrst sentence of [SemiAnbd], Deﬁnition 3.5, (ii), the phrase “Suppose
that” should read “Suppose that each connected component of”; the phrase “splits
the restriction of” should read “splits the restriction of this connected component
of”.
(vi) In order to carry out the argument stated in the proof of [SemiAnbd],
Proposition 5.2, (i), it is necessary to strengthen the conditions (c) and (d) of
[SemiAnbd], Deﬁnition 5.1, (i), as follows. This strengthening of the conditions (c)
and (d) of [SemiAnbd], Deﬁnition 5.1, (i), has no eﬀect either on the remainder
of [SemiAnbd] or on subsequent papers of the author. Suppose that G is as in
[SemiAnbd], Deﬁnition 5.1, (i). Then we begin by making the following observation:
(O1) Suppose that G is ﬁnite. Then G admits a coﬁnal, countable collection
of connected ﬁnite étale Galois coverings {G i → G}i∈I , each of which is
characteristic [i.e., any pull-back of the covering via an element of Aut(G)
is isomorphic to the original covering]. [For instance, one veriﬁes immediately, by applying the ﬁniteness and coherence of G, that such a collection
of coverings may be obtained by considering, for n a positive integer, the
composite of all connected ﬁnite étale Galois coverings of degree ≤ n.] We
may assume, without loss of generality, that this collection of coverings


— where we write “Aut(G/G)”
for the group of pairs of compatible auto
morphisms of G and G.
This observation (O1) has the following immediate consequence:
(O2) Suppose that we are in the situation of (O1). Consider, for i ∈ I, the
ﬁnite index normal subgroup


Aut(G/G)


of elements of Aut(G/G)
that induce the identity automorphism on the

underlying semi-graph G of G i , as well as on Gal(G i /G). Then one
veriﬁes immediately [from the deﬁnition of a semi-graph of anabelioids;
cf. also [SemiAnbd], Proposition 2.5, (i)] that the intersection of the

termine a natural proﬁnite topology on Aut(G/G) and hence also on the
quotient Aut(G), which is easily seen to be compatible with the proﬁnite


topology on Gal(G/G)
and, moreover, independent of the choice of G.
The new version of the condition (c) of [SemiAnbd], Deﬁnition 5.1, (i), that we
wish to consider is the following:
(cnew ) The action of H on G is trivial; the resulting homomorphism H →
Aut(G[c]), where c ranges over the components [i.e., vertices and edges]

56

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

of G, is continuous [i.e., relative to the natural proﬁnite group topology
deﬁned in (O2) on Aut(G[c])].
It is immediate that (cnew ) implies (c). Moreover, we observe in passing that:
(O3) In fact, since H is topologically ﬁnitely generated [cf. [SemiAnbd], Deﬁnition 5.1, (i), (a)], it holds [cf. [NS], Theorem 1.1] that every ﬁnite index
subgroup of H is open in H. Thus, the conditions (c) and (cnew ) in fact
hold automatically.
The new version of the condition (d) of [SemiAnbd], Deﬁnition 5.1, (i), that we
wish to consider is the following:
(dnew ) There is a ﬁnite set C ∗ of components [i.e., vertices and edges] of G
such that for every component c of G, there exists a c∗ ∈ C ∗ and an
∼
isomorphism of semi-graphs of anabelioids G[c] → G[c∗ ] that is compatible
with the action of H on both sides.
It is immediate that (dnew ) implies (d). The reason that, in the context of the
proof of [SemiAnbd], Proposition 5.2, (i), it is necessary to consider the stronger
conditions (cnew ) and (dnew ) is as follows. It suﬃces to show that, given a connected
ﬁnite étale covering G  → G, after possibly replacing H by an open subgroup of
H, the action of H on G lifts to an action on G  that satisﬁes the conditions of
[SemiAnbd], Deﬁnition 5.1, (i). Such a lifting of the action of H on G to an action
on the portion of G  that lies over the vertices of G follows in a straightforward
manner from the original conditions (a), (b), (c), and (d). On the other hand,
in order to conclude that such a lifting is [after possibly replacing H by an open
subgroup of H] compatible with the gluing conditions arising from the structure of
G  over the edges of G, it is necessary to assume further that the “component-wise
versions (cnew ), (dnew )” of the original “vertex-wise conditions (c), (d)” hold. This
issue is closely related to the issue discussed in (iii) above.
Finally, we observe that Proposition 2.4, Corollary 2.5 admit the following
discrete analogues, which may be regarded as generalizations of [André], Lemma
3.2.1 [cf. Theorem 2.6 below in the case where H = F = G is free]; [EtTh], Lemma
2.17, (i).
Theorem 2.6.
(Proﬁnite Conjugates of Discrete Subgroups) Let F be
a group that contains a subgroup of ﬁnite index G ⊆ F such that G is either a
free discrete group of ﬁnite rank or an orientable surface group [i.e., a
fundamental group of a compact orientable topological surface of genus ≥ 2]; H ⊆ F
an inﬁnite subgroup. Since F is residually ﬁnite [cf., e.g., [Conﬁg], Proposition 7.1,
(ii)], we shall write H, G ⊆ F ⊆ F , where F denotes the proﬁnite completion of
F . Let γ ∈ F be an element such that
γ · H · γ −1 ⊆ F [or, equivalently, H ⊆ γ −1 · F · γ].

def
Write HG = H G. Then γ ∈ F · NF (HG ), i.e., γ · HG · γ −1 = δ · HG · δ −1 , for
some δ ∈ F . If, moreover, HG is nonabelian, then γ ∈ F .
Proof. Let us ﬁrst consider the case where HG is abelian. In this case, it follows
from Lemma 2.7, (iv), below, that HG is cyclic. Thus, by applying Lemma 2.7,

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY I

57

(ii), it follows that by replacing G by an appropriate ﬁnite index subgroup of G,
we may assume that the natural composite homomorphism HG → G  Gab is a
split injection. In particular, by Lemma 2.7, (v), we conclude that NG (HG ) = HG ,
where we write HG for the closure of HG in the proﬁnite completion G of G. Next,
let us observe that by multiplying γ on the left by an appropriate element of F , we

G = G. Next, let us
may assume that γ ∈ G. Thus, we have γ · HG · γ −1 ⊆ F
recall that G is conjugacy separable. Indeed, this is precisely the content of [Stb1],
Theorem 1, when G is free; [Stb2], Theorem 3.3, when G is an orientable surface
group. Since G is conjugacy separable, it follows that γ · HG · γ −1 =  · HG · −1 for
some  ∈ G, so γ ∈ G · NG (HG ) = G · HG ⊆ F · NF (HG ), as desired. This completes
the proof of Theorem 2.6 when HG is abelian.
Thus, let us assume for the remainder of the proof of Theorem 2.6 that HG is
nonabelian. Then, by applying Lemma 2.7, (iii), it follows that, after replacing G by
an appropriate ﬁnite index subgroup of G, we may assume that there exist elements
x, y ∈ HG that generate a free abelian subgroup of rank two M ⊆ Gab such that
the injection M → Gab splits. Write Hx , Hy ⊆ HG for the subgroups generated,
respectively, by x and y; Hx , Hy ⊆ G for the respective closures of Hx , Hy . Then
by Lemma 2.7, (v), we conclude that NG (Hx ) = Hx , NG (Hy ) = Hy . Next, let us
observe that by multiplying γ on the left by an appropriate element of F , we may

assume that γ ∈ G. Thus, we have γ · HG · γ −1 ⊆ F
G = G. In particular, by
applying the portion of Theorem 2.6 that has already been proven to the subgroups
Hx , Hy ⊆ G, we conclude that γ ∈ G · NG (Hx ) = G · Hx , γ ∈ G · NG (Hy ) = G · Hy .
Thus, by projecting to Gab , and applying the fact that M is of rank two, we conclude
that γ ∈ G, as desired. This completes the proof of Theorem 2.6. 
Remark 2.6.1. Note that in the situation of Theorem 2.6, if HG is abelian, then
— unlike the tempered case discussed in Proposition 2.4! — it is not necessarily
the case that F = γ −1 · F · γ.
Lemma 2.7.
(Well-known Properties of Free Groups and Orientable
Surface Groups) Let G be a group as in Theorem 2.6. Write G for the proﬁnite
completion of G. Then:
(i) Any subgroup of G generated by two elements of G is free.
(ii) Let x ∈ G be an element = 1. Then there exists a ﬁnite index subgroup
G1 ⊆ G such that x ∈ G1 , and x has nontrivial image in the abelianization Gab
1
of G1 .
(iii) Let x, y ∈ G be noncommuting elements of G. Then there exists a
ﬁnite index subgroup G1 ⊆ G and a positive integer n such that xn , y n ∈ G1 , and
the images of xn and y n in the abelianization Gab
1 of G1 generate a free abelian
subgroup of rank two.
(iv) Any abelian subgroup of G is cyclic.
(v) Let T ⊆ G be a closed subgroup such that there exists a continuous surjec∼
tion of topological groups G  Z that induces an isomorphism T → Z. Then T is
normally terminal in G.

(vi) Suppose that G is nonabelian. Write N ⊆ G for the kernel of the natural
surjection G  Gab to the abelianization Gab of G. Then the centralizer ZG (N )
of N in G is trivial.
(vii) In the notation of (vi), let α be an automorphism of the proﬁnite group
G that preserves and restricts to the identity on the subgroup N . Then α is the
identity automorphism of G.
Proof. First, we consider assertion (i). If G is free, then assertion (i) follows
from the well-known fact that any subgroup of a free group is free. If G is an
orientable surface group, then assertion (i) follows immediately — i.e., by considering the noncompact covering of a compact surface that corresponds to an inﬁnite
index subgroup of G of the sort discussed in assertion (i) — from a classical result
concerning the fundamental group of a noncompact surface due to Johansson [cf.
[Stl], p. 142; the discussion preceding [FRS], Theorem A1]. This completes the
proof of assertion (i). Next, we consider assertion (ii). Since G is residually ﬁnite
[cf., e.g., [Conﬁg], Proposition 7.1, (ii)], it follows that there exists a ﬁnite index
normal subgroup G0 ⊆ G such that x ∈ G0 . Thus, it suﬃces to take G1 to be the
subgroup of G generated by G0 and x. This completes the proof of assertion (ii).
Next, we consider assertion (iii). By applying assertion (i) to the subgroup J
of G generated by x and y, it follows from the fact that x and y are noncommuting
elements of G that J is a free group of rank 2, hence that xa · y b = 1, for all
(a, b) ∈ Z × Z such that (a, b) = (0, 0). Next, let us recall the well-known fact
that the abelianization of any ﬁnite index subgroup of G is torsion-free. Thus,
by applying assertion (ii) to x and y, we conclude that there exists a ﬁnite index
subgroup G0 ⊆ G and a positive integer m such that xm , y m ∈ G0 , and xm and y m
ma
have nontrivial image in the abelianization Gab
· y mb
0 of G0 . Now suppose that x
lies in the kernel of the natural surjection G0  Gab
0 for some (a, b) ∈ Z × Z
such that (a, b) = (0, 0). Since G is residually ﬁnite, and [as we observed above]
xma · y mb = 1, it follows, by applying assertion (ii) to G0 , that there exists a ﬁnite
index subgroup G1 ⊆ G0 and a positive integer n that is divisible by m such that
ab
xn , y n , xma · y mb ∈ G1 , and the image of xma · y mb in Gab
1 is nontrivial. Since G1
is torsion-free, it thus follows that the image of xna · y nb in Gab
1 is nontrivial. On
ab
the other hand, by considering the natural homomorphism Gab
1 → G0 , we thus
conclude that the images of xn and y n in Gab
1 generate a free abelian subgroup of
rank two, as desired. This completes the proof of assertion (iii).
Next, we consider assertion (iv). By assertion (i), it follows that any abelian
subgroup of G generated by two elements is free, hence cyclic. In particular, we
conclude that any abelian subgroup J of G is equal to the union of the groups
that appear in some chain G1 ⊆ G2 ⊆ . . . ⊆ G of cyclic subgroups of G. On
the other hand, by applying assertion (ii) to some generator of G1 , it follows that
there exists a ﬁnite index subgroup G0 and a positive integer n such that Gnj ⊆ G0
for all j = 1, 2, . . . , and, moreover, Gn1 has nontrivial image in Gab
0 . Thus, by
ab
considering the image in [the ﬁnitely generated abelian group] G0 of the chain
of cyclic subgroups Gn1 ⊆ Gn2 ⊆ . . . , we conclude that this chain, hence also the
original chain G1 ⊆ G2 ⊆ . . . , must terminate. Thus, J is cyclic, as desired. This
completes the proof of assertion (iv).

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY I

Next, we consider assertion (v). By considering the surjection G  Z, we conclude immediately that the normalizer NG (T ) of T in G is equal to the centralizer

ZG (T ) of T in G. If ZG (T ) = T , then it follows immediately that, for some prime
number l, there exists a closed [abelian] subgroup T1 ⊆ ZG (T ) containing the pro-l

portion of T such that there exists a continuous surjection Zl × Zl  T1 whose kernel lies in l · (Zl × Zl ). In particular, one computes easily that the l-cohomological
dimension of T1 is ≥ 2. On the other hand, since T1 is of inﬁnite index in G, it
follows immediately that there exists an open subgroup G1 ⊆ G of G such that
T1 ⊆ G1 , and, moreover, there exists a continuous surjection φ : G1  Zl whose
kernel Ker(φ) contains T1 . In particular, since the cohomology of T1 may be computed as the direct limit of the cohomologies of open subgroups of G containing T1 ,
it follows immediately from the existence of φ, together with the well-known structure of the cohomology of open subgroups of G, that the l-cohomological dimension
of T1 is 1, a contradiction. This completes the proof of assertion (v).
Next, we consider assertion (vi). Write N ⊆ G for the kernel of the natural surjection G  Gab to the abelianization Gab of G. It follows immediately
from the “tautological universal property” of a free group or an orientable surface group [i.e., regarded as the quotient of a free group by a single relation] that
N is not cyclic, hence by assertion (iv), that N is nonabelian. Thus, by assertion (iii), there exist a ﬁnite index subgroup 
G1 ⊆ G equipped with a surjection
G1 such that β(x) = (1, 0) and
β : G1  Z × Z and elements x, y ∈ N
β(y) = (0, 1). In particular, it follows from assertion (v) that the closed subgroups
Tx , Ty ⊆ G topologically generated by x and y, respectively, are normally terminal in the proﬁnite completion G1 ⊆ G of G1 . But this implies formally that



ZG ( N )
Ty = {1} [where the last equalG1 ⊆ ZG (Tx )

1

ity follows from the existence of the surjection G1  Z × Z induced by β]. Since [as
is well-known] the abelianizations of all open subgroups of G are torsion-free, we
thus conclude that ZG (N ) = {1}, as desired. This completes the proof of assertion
(vi). Finally, we consider assertion (vii). If x ∈ G, y ∈ N [so x · y · x−1 ∈ N ], then
x · y · x−1 = α(x · y · x−1 ) = α(x) · α(y) · α(x)−1 = α(x) · y · α(x)−1 . We thus
conclude from assertion (vi) that α(x) · x−1 ∈ ZG (N ) = {1}, i.e., that α(x) = x.
This completes the proof of assertion (vii). 
Corollary 2.8. (Subgroups of Topological Fundamental Groups of Complex Hyperbolic Curves) Let Z be a hyperbolic curve over C. Write ΠZ for
the usual topological fundamental group of Z; ΠZ for the proﬁnite completion of
ΠZ . Let H ⊆ ΠZ be an inﬁnite subgroup [such as a cuspidal inertia group!];
γ ∈ ΠZ an element such that
γ · H · γ −1 ⊆ ΠZ

[or, equivalently, H ⊆ γ −1 · ΠZ · γ].

Then γ ∈ ΠZ · NΠ (H), i.e., γ · H · γ −1 = δ · H · δ −1 , for some δ ∈ ΠZ . If, moreover,
Z
H is nonabelian, then γ ∈ ΠZ .
Remark 2.8.1. Corollary 2.8 is an immediate consequence of Theorem 2.6. In
fact, in the present series of papers, we shall only apply Corollary 2.8 in the case

where Z is non-proper, and H is a cuspidal inertia group. In this case, the proof
of Theorem 2.6 may be simpliﬁed somewhat, but we chose to include the general
version given here, for the sake of completeness.

Section 3: Chains of Θ-Hodge Theaters
In the present §3, we construct chains of “Θ-Hodge theaters”. Each “Θ-Hodge
theater” is to be thought of as a sort of miniature model of the conventional
scheme-theoretic arithmetic geometry that surrounds the theta function.
This miniature model is formulated via the theory of Frobenioids [cf. [FrdI]; [FrdII];
[EtTh], §3, §4, §5]. On the other hand, the link [cf. Corollary 3.7, (i)] between
adjacent members of such chains is purely Frobenioid-theoretic, i.e., it lies outside
the framework of ring theory/scheme theory. It is these chains of Θ-Hodge theaters
that form the starting point of the theory of the present series of papers.
Deﬁnition 3.1.

We shall refer to as initial Θ-data any collection of data
(F /F, XF , l, C K , V, Vbad
mod , )

that satisﬁes the following conditions:
√
(a) F is a number ﬁeld such that −1 ∈ F ; F is an algebraic closure of F .
def

Write GF = Gal(F /F ).
(b) XF is a once-punctured elliptic curve [i.e., a hyperbolic curve of type
(1, 1)] over F that admits stable reduction over all v ∈ V(F )non . Write EF
for the elliptic curve over F determined by XF [so XF ⊆ EF ];
XF → C F
for the hyperbolic orbicurve [cf. §0] over F obtained by forming the stacktheoretic quotient of XF by the unique F -involution [i.e., automorphism
of order two] “−1” of XF ; Fmod ⊆ F for the ﬁeld of moduli [cf., e.g.,
[AbsTopIII], Deﬁnition 5.1, (ii)] of XF ; Fsol ⊆ F for the maximal solvable
def

extension of Fmod in F ; Vmod = V(Fmod ). Then
Vbad
mod ⊆ Vmod
is a nonempty set of nonarchimedean valuations of Fmod of odd residue
characteristic such that XF has bad [i.e., multiplicative] reduction at the

sequences 1 → Δ(−) → Π(−)F → GF → 1 for “(−)” taken to be either
“X” or “C”.] Here, we suppose further that the ﬁeld extension F/Fmod

62

is Galois of degree prime to l, and that the 2 · 3-torsion points of EF are
rational over F .
(c) l is a prime number ≥ 5 such that the image of the outer homomorphism
GF → GL2 (Fl )
determined by the l-torsion points of EF contains the subgroup SL2 (Fl ) ⊆
GL2 (Fl ); write K ⊆ F for the ﬁnite Galois extension of F determined by
the kernel of this homomorphism. Also, we suppose that l is prime to the
[residue characteristics of the] elements of Vbad
mod , as well as to the orders
of the q-parameters of EF [i.e., in the terminology of [GenEll], Deﬁnition
3.3, the “local heights” of EF ] at the primes of V(F )bad .
(d) C K is a hyperbolic orbicurve of type (1, l-tors)± [cf. [EtTh], Deﬁnition 2.1]
over K, with K-core [cf. [CanLift], Remark 2.1.1; [EtTh], the discussion
def

at the beginning of §2] given by CK = CF ×F K. [Thus, by (c), it follows
that C K is completely determined, up to isomorphism over F , by CF .] In
particular, C K determines, up to K-isomorphism, a hyperbolic orbicurve

proﬁnite groups “Π(−) ” admit natural outer surjections onto the decomdef

position group Gv ⊆ GK = Gal(F /K) determined, up to GK -conjugacy,
by v. If v ∈ Vbad , then we assume further that the hyperbolic orbicurve
C v is of type (1, Z/lZ)± [cf. [EtTh], Deﬁnition 2.5, (i)]. [Here, we note
that it follows from the portion of (b) concerning 2-torsion points that the
base ﬁeld Kv satisﬁes the assumption “K = K̈” of [EtTh], Deﬁnition 2.5,

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

Remark 3.1.2.
(i) Observe that the open subgroup ΠX K ⊆ ΠC K may be constructed grouptheoretically from the topological group ΠC K . Indeed, it follows immediately from
the construction of the coverings “X”, “C” in the discussion at the beginning
of [EtTh], §2 [cf. also [AbsAnab], Lemma 1.1.4, (i)], that the closed subgroup
ΔX ⊆ ΠC K may be characterized by a rather simple explicit algorithm. Since the
decomposition groups of ΠC K at the nonzero cusps — i.e., the cusps whose inertia
groups are contained in ΔX [cf. the discussion at the beginning of §1] — are also
group-theoretic [cf., e.g., [AbsTopI], Lemma 4.5, as well as Remark 1.2.2, (ii), of the
present paper], the above observation follows immediately from the easily veriﬁed
fact that the image of any of these decomposition groups associated to nonzero
cusps coincides with the image of ΠX K in ΠC K /ΔX .
(ii) In light of the observation of (i), it makes sense to adopt the following
convention:
Instead of applying the group-theoretic reconstruction algorithm of [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9 [cf. also the discussion of [AbsTopIII], Remark
2.8.3], directly to ΠC K [or topological groups isomorphic to ΠC K ], we
shall apply this reconstruction algorithm to the open subgroup ΠX K ⊆
ΠC K to reconstruct the function ﬁeld of X K , equipped with its natural
Gal(X K /C K ) ∼
= ΠC K /ΠX K -action.
In this context, we shall refer to this approach of applying [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9,

as the Θ-approach to [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9. Note that, for v ∈ Vgood Vnon
(respectively, v ∈ Vbad ), one may also adopt a “Θ-approach” to applying [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9, to ΠC v or [by applying Corollary 1.2] Π−

of [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9, (b) [cf. also [AbsTopIII], Proposition 1.4, (ii); [AbsTopIII], Remark 1.10.1, (ii)], may be naturally identiﬁed with Hom(H 2 (Δell
X , Z), Z).
In particular, we obtain a tautological isomorphism
∼

MX → (l · ΔΘ )

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY I

65

[i.e., since [ΔX : ΔX ] = l]. In particular, we observe that if we write ΠCFmod
for the étale fundamental group of the orbicurve CFmod discussed in Remark 3.1.7,
∼
(i), below, then MX → (l · ΔΘ ) may be regarded as a characteristic subquotient
of ΠCFmod , hence admits a natural conjugation action by ΠCFmod . From the point
of view of the theory of the present series of papers, the signiﬁcance of the “Θ∼
approach” lies precisely in the existence of this tautological isomorphism MX → (l ·
ΔΘ ), which will be applied in [IUTchII] at v ∈ Vbad . That is to say, the Θ-approach
involves applying the reconstruction algorithm of [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9, via the
cyclotome MX , which may be identiﬁed, via the above tautological isomorphism,
with the cyclotome (l · ΔΘ ), which plays a central role in the theory of [EtTh] —
cf., especially, the discussion of “cyclotomic rigidity” in [EtTh], Corollary 2.19, (i).
(iv) If one thinks of the prime number l as being “large”, then the role played
by the covering X in the above discussion of the “Θ-approach” is reminiscent of the
role played by the universal covering of a complex elliptic curve by the complex plane
in the holomorphic reconstruction theory of [AbsTopIII], §2 [cf., e.g., [AbsTopIII],
Propositions 2.5, 2.6].
Remark 3.1.3. Since Vbad
mod = ∅ [cf. Deﬁnition 3.1, (b)], it follows immediately
from Deﬁnition 3.1, (d), (e), (f), that the data (F /F, XF , l, C K , V, Vbad
mod , ) is,
bad
in fact, completely determined by the data (F /F, XF , C K , V, Vmod ), and that
C K is completely determined up to K-isomorphism by the data (F /F, XF , l, V).
Finally, we remark that for given data (XF , l, Vbad
mod ), distinct choices of “V” will
not aﬀect the theory in any signiﬁcant way.
Remark 3.1.4. It follows immediately from the deﬁnitions that at each v ∈ Vbad
[which is necessarily prime to l — cf. Deﬁnition 3.1, (c)] (respectively, each v ∈


X
Vgood Vnon which is prime to l; each v ∈ Vgood Vnon ), X v (respectively, −
→v ;
X v ) admits a stable model over the ring of integers of Kv .
Remark 3.1.5. Note that since the 3-torsion points of EF are rational over F ,
and F is Galois over Fmod [cf. Deﬁnition 3.1, (b)], it follows [cf., e.g., [IUTchIV],
Proposition 1.8, (iv)] that K is Galois over Fmod . In addition to working with
the ﬁeld Fmod and various extensions of Fmod contained in F , we shall also have
occasion to work with the algebraic stack
def

Smod = Spec(OK ) // Gal(K/Fmod )
obtained by forming the stack-theoretic quotient [i.e., “//”] of the spectrum of the
ring of integers OK of K by the Galois group Gal(K/Fmod ). Thus, any ﬁnite extension L ⊆ F of Fmod in F determines, by forming the integral closure of Smod in L, an
algebraic stack Smod,L over Smod . In particular, by considering arithmetic line bundles over such Smod,L , one may associate to any ﬁnite quotient Gal(F /Fmod )  Q
a Frobenioid via [the easily veriﬁed “stack-theoretic version” of] the construction
of [FrdI], Example 6.3. One veriﬁes immediately that an appropriate analogue of
[FrdI], Theorem 6.4, holds for such stack-theoretic versions of the Frobenioids constructed in [FrdI], Example 6.3. Also, we observe that upon passing to either the

66

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

perfection or the realiﬁcation, such stack-theoretic versions become naturally isomorphic to the non-stack-theoretic versions [i.e., of [FrdI], Example 6.3, as stated].
Remark 3.1.6. In light of the important role played by the various orbicurves
constructed in [EtTh], §2, in the present series of papers, we take the opportunity
to correct an unfortunate — albeit in fact irrelevant! — error in [EtTh]. In the
discussion preceding [EtTh], Deﬁnition 2.1, one must in fact assume that the integer
l is odd in order for the quotient ΔX to be well-deﬁned. Since, ultimately, in [EtTh]
[cf. the discussion following [EtTh], Remark 5.7.1], as well as in the present series
of papers, this is the only case that is of interest, this oversight does not aﬀect
either the present series of papers or the bulk of the remainder of [EtTh]. Indeed,
the only places in [EtTh] where the case of even l is used are [EtTh], Remark 2.2.1,
and the application of [EtTh], Remark 2.2.1, in the proof of [EtTh], Proposition
2.12, for the orbicurves “Ċ”. Thus, [EtTh], Remark 2.2.1, must be deleted; in
[EtTh], Proposition 2.12, one must in fact exclude the case where the orbicurve
under consideration is “Ċ”. On the other hand, this theory involving [EtTh],
Proposition 2.12 [cf., especially, [EtTh], Corollaries 2.18, 2.19] is only applied after
the discussion following [EtTh], Remark 5.7.1, i.e., which only treats the curves
“X”. That is to say, ultimately, in [EtTh], as well as in the present series of papers,
one is only interested in the curves “X”, whose treatment only requires the case of
odd l.
Remark 3.1.7.
(i) Observe that it follows immediately from the deﬁnition of Fmod and the Kcoricity of CK [cf. Deﬁnition 3.1, (b), (d)] that CF admits a unique [up to unique
isomorphism] model
CFmod
over Fmod . If v ∈ Vmod , then we shall write Cv for the result of base-changing this
model to (Fmod )v . When applying the group-theoretic reconstruction algorithm
of [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9 [cf. Remark 3.1.2, (ii)], it will frequently be useful to
consider certain special types of rational functions on CFmod and Cv , as follows.
Let L be a ﬁeld which is equal either to Fmod or to (Fmod )v for some v ∈ Vmod .
Write CL for the model just discussed of CF over L. Thus, one veriﬁes immediately
that the coarse space |CL | associated to the algebraic stack CL is isomorphic to
the aﬃne line over L. Now suppose that we are given an algebraic closure LC
of the function ﬁeld LC of CL . Write L for the algebraic closure of L determined
by LC . We shall refer to a closed point of the proper smooth curve determined
by some ﬁnite subextension ⊆ LC of LC as a critical point if it maps to a closed
point of the [proper smooth] compactiﬁcation |CL |cpt of |CL | that arises from one
of the 2-torsion points of EF ; we shall refer to a critical point which does not
map to the closed point of |CL |cpt that arises from the unique cusp of CL as strictly
critical. Thus, as one might imagine from the central importance of 2-torsion points
in the elementary theory of elliptic curves, the strictly critical points of |CL |cpt may
be thought of as the “most fundamental/canonical non-cuspidal points” of
|CL |cpt . We shall refer to a rational function f ∈ LC on CL as κ-coric — where we
think of the κ as standing for “Kummer” — if

· whenever f ∈ L, it holds that, over L, f has precisely one pole [of
unrestricted order], but at least two distinct zeroes;
· the divisor of zeroes and poles of f is deﬁned over a number ﬁeld and
avoids the critical points;
· f restricts to a root of unity at every strictly critical point of |CL |cpt .
Thus, the ﬁrst displayed condition, taken together with the latter portion of the
second displayed condition, may be understood as the condition that there exist
a unique non-critical L-rational point of |CL |cpt with respect to which [i.e., if one
takes this L-rational point to be the “point at inﬁnity”] f may be thought of as a
polynomial on the aﬃne line over L with non-critical zeroes. In particular, it
follows from the ﬁrst displayed condition that, whenever f ∈ L, it is never the case
that both f and f −1 are κ-coric. By contrast, the third displayed condition may be
understood as the condition that restriction to the strictly critical points determines
a sort of canonical splitting up to roots of unity [which will play an important
role in the present series of papers — cf., e.g., the discussion of Example 5.1, (v);
Deﬁnition 5.2, (vi), (viii); Remark 5.2.3, below] of the set of nonzero constant [i.e.,
L-] multiples of κ-coric functions into a direct product, up to roots of unity, of
the set of κ-coric functions and the set of nonzero elements of L. In particular, it
follows from the third displayed condition that if c ∈ L and f ∈ LC are such that
both f and c · f are κ-coric, then c is a root of unity.
(ii) We maintain the notation of (i). Let L be an intermediate ﬁeld between
L and L that is solvably closed [cf. [GlSol], Deﬁnition 1, (i)], i.e., has no nontrivial
abelian extensions. Observe that, since |CL |cpt has precisely 4 critical points, it
follows immediately from the elementary theory of polynomial functions on
the aﬃne line over L [i.e., the complement in |CL |cpt of some L-rational point
|CL |cpt ] that there exists a κ-coric fsol ∈ LC [i.e., a rational function on the aﬃne
line over L] of degree 4. In particular, it follows immediately from the elementary
theory of polynomial functions on the aﬃne line [i.e., |CL |] over L [together with
“Hensel’s lemma” — cf., e.g., the method of proof of [AbsTopII], Lemma 2.1]
(respectively, from the existence of fsol [together with the well-known fact that the
symmetric group on 4 letters is solvable]) that
every element of L (respectively, L ) appears as a value of some κ-coric
rational function on CL at some L- (respectively, L -) valued point of CL
that is not critical.
×

If L = Fmod , then write UL for the group L of nonzero elements of L; if L =
(Fmod )v for some v ∈ Vmod , then write UL for the group of units [i.e., relative
to the unique valuation on L that extends v] of L. We shall say that an element
f ∈ LC is ∞ κ-coric if there exists a positive integer n such that f n is a κ-coric
element of LC ; we shall say that an element f ∈ LC is ∞ κ×-coric if there exists
an element c ∈ UL such that c · f ∈ LC is ∞ κ-coric. Thus, an element f ∈ LC is
κ-coric if and only if it is ∞ κ-coric. Also, one veriﬁes immediately that
an ∞ κ×-coric element f ∈ LC is ∞ κ-coric if and only if it restricts to a
root of unity at some [or, equivalently, every] strictly critical point of the
proper smooth curve determined by some ﬁnite subextension ⊆ LC of the
function ﬁeld LC that contains f .

Finally, one veriﬁes immediately that the operation of multiplication determines a
structure of pseudo-monoid [cf. §0] on the sets of κ-, ∞ κ-, and ∞ κ×-coric rational
functions; moreover, in the case of ∞ κ- and ∞ κ×-coric rational functions, the resulting pseudo-monoid is divisible and cyclotomic. These pseudo-monoids will be
of use in discussions concerning the Kummer theory of rational functions on CL
[cf. Example 5.1, (i), (v); Deﬁnition 5.2, (v), (vi), (vii), (viii), below].
(iii) We maintain the notation of (i) and (ii) and assume further that L = Fmod ,
×
L = F . We shall say that an element f ∈ LC is κ-solvable if it is an Fsol
-multiple
[cf. Deﬁnition 3.1, (b)] of a ∞ κ-coric element of LC . Thus, one veriﬁes immediately
that an element f ∈ LC is κ-solvable if and only if there exists a positive integer
n such that f n is a ∞ κ×-coric element of Fsol · LC . Write F (μl ) ⊆ K for the
subextension of K generated by the l-th roots of unity; LC (κ-sol) ⊆ LC for the
subﬁeld of LC generated by the κ-solvable elements of LC ; LC (C K ) ⊆ LC for the
subﬁeld of LC generated over LC by the images of the F (μl )·LC -linear embeddings
into LC of the function ﬁeld of C K . Thus, the fact that the extension F/Fmod is
Galois of degree prime to l [cf. Deﬁnition 3.1, (b)] implies that
the subgroup Gal(K/F (μl )) ⊆ Gal(K/Fmod ) is normal and may be characterized as the unique subgroup of Gal(K/Fmod ) that is [abstractly]
isomorphic to SL2 (Fl )
[cf. Remark 3.1.5; [GenEll], Lemma 3.1, (i)]. Moreover, we observe that it follows
immediately from the well-known fact that the ﬁnite group SL2 (Fl ) is perfect [cf.
Deﬁnition 3.1, (c); [GenEll], Lemma 3.1, (ii)], together with the deﬁnition of the
term “∞ κ×-coric” [cf., especially, the fact that the zeroes and poles avoid the critical
points!], that
the subﬁelds LC (C K ) ⊆ LC ⊇ F (μl ) · LC (κ-sol) are linearly disjoint
over F (μl ) · LC .
In particular, it follows that there is a natural isomorphism
∼

Gal(LC (C K )/F (μl ) · LC ) → Gal(LC (C K ) · LC (κ-sol)/F (μl ) · LC (κ-sol))
— i.e., one may regard Gal(LC (C K )/F (μl ) · LC ) as being equipped with an action
on LC (C K ) · LC (κ-sol) that restricts to the trivial action on F (μl ) · LC (κ-sol).
(iv) We maintain the notation of (iii). In the following, we shall write “Out(−)”
for the group of outer automorphisms of the topological group in parentheses. Consider the tautological exact sequence of Galois groups

Gal(LC /LC )

→ Gal(LC (κ-sol)/LC )

[cf. the discussion of (iii)]. Let us refer to a subgroup of Gal(LC /LC (κ-sol)) as
a κ-sol-open subgroup if it is the intersection with Gal(LC /LC (κ-sol)) of a normal
open subgroup of Gal(LC /LC ). Thus, the subgroups
Autκ-sol (Gal(LC /LC (κ-sol))) ⊆ Aut(Gal(LC /LC (κ-sol)))
Outκ-sol (Gal(LC /LC (κ-sol))) ⊆ Out(Gal(LC /LC (κ-sol)))

of automorphisms/outer automorphisms of the topological group Gal(LC /LC (κ-sol))
that preserve each κ-sol-open subgroup — i.e., of “κ-sol-automorphisms/κ-sol-outer
automorphisms” — admit natural compatible homomorphisms
Autκ-sol (Gal(LC /LC (κ-sol))) → Aut(Q)
Outκ-sol (Gal(LC /LC (κ-sol))) → Out(Q)
for each quotient Gal(LC /LC (κ-sol))  Q by a κ-sol-open subgroup. The kernels of
these natural homomorphisms [for varying “Q”] determine natural proﬁnite topologies on Autκ-sol (Gal(LC /LC (κ-sol))), Outκ-sol (Gal(LC /LC (κ-sol))), with respect to
which each arrow of the commutative diagram of homomorphisms

Finally, we observe that
Gal(LC /LC (κ-sol)) is center-free; in particular, the above commutative
diagram of homomorphisms of topological groups is cartesian.
Indeed, let us ﬁrst observe that it follows immediately from the deﬁnitions that
Gal(F · LC (κ-sol)/F · LC ) is abelian. Thus, it follows formally, by applying Lemma
2.7, (vi), (vii), to the geometric fundamental groups of the various genus zero aﬃne
hyperbolic curves whose function ﬁeld is equal to LC , that the conjugacy action by
any element α in the center of Gal(LC /LC (κ-sol)) on such a [center-free] geometric
fundamental group is trivial and hence, by [the special case that was already known
to Belyi of] the Galois injectivity result discussed in [NodNon], Theorem C, that α
is the identity element of Gal(LC /LC (κ-sol)), as desired.
Given initial Θ-data as in Deﬁnition 3.1, the theory of Frobenioids given in
[FrdI], [FrdII], [EtTh] allows one to construct various associated Frobenioids, as
follows.

to formulate various elementary classical facts [which are reviewed in [EtTh], §1]
concerning the theory of the line bundles and divisors related to the classical theta
function on a Tate curve over an MLF. We give a brief review of this theory of
[EtTh], §5, as follows:

cf. also the discussion of Remark 3.2.4 below] over a base category
Dv
[i.e., the category denoted “D” in the discussion at the beginning of [EtTh], §5].
We recall from the theory of [EtTh] that Dv may be thought of as the category
of connected tempered coverings — i.e., “B temp (X v )0 ” in the notation of [EtTh],
Example 3.9 — of the hyperbolic curve X v . In the following, we shall write
Dv = B(Kv )0
def

[cf. the notational conventions concerning categories discussed in §0]. Also, we
observe that Dv may be naturally regarded [by pulling back ﬁnite étale coverings
via the structure morphism X v → Spec(Kv )] as a full subcategory
Dv ⊆ Dv
of Dv , and that we have a natural functor Dv → Dv , which is left-adjoint to
the natural inclusion functor Dv → Dv [cf. [FrdII], Example 1.3, (ii)]. If (−)
is an object of Dv , then we shall denote by “T(−) ” the Frobenius-trivial object [a
notion which is category-theoretic — cf. [FrdI], Deﬁnition 1.2, (iv); [FrdI], Corollary
4.11, (iv); [EtTh], Proposition 5.1] of F v [which is completely determined up to
isomorphism] that lies over “(−)”.

the birationalization

beginning of [EtTh], §5. Thus, we may think of Ÿ v as an object of Dv [cf. the
object “Abs

“Frobenioid-theoretic l-th root of √
the theta function”, which is normalized so as to
attain the value 1 at the point “ −1” [cf. [EtTh], Theorem 5.7]; we shall denote
the reciprocal of [i.e., “1 over”] this theta function by

for the full subcategory of the category (Dv )Ÿ

[cf. the notational conventions

concerning categories discussed in §0] determined by the products in Dv of Ÿ v

that maps τv to τvΘ . This fact may be stated more succinctly by writing

def

— where we write Fv = (Cv , τv ); FvΘ = (CvΘ , τvΘ ). In the following, we shall refer
to a pair such as Fv or FvΘ consisting of a Frobenioid equipped with a collection
of characteristic splittings as a split Frobenioid.
(vi) Here, it is useful to recall [cf. Remark 3.2.1 below] that:
(a) the subcategory Dv ⊆ Dv may be reconstructed category-theoretically
from Dv [cf. [AbsAnab], Lemma 1.3.8];
(b) the category DvΘ may be reconstructed category-theoretically from Dv [cf.
(a); the discussion at the beginning of [EtTh], §5];
(c) the category Dv (respectively, DvΘ ) may be reconstructed category-theoretically
from Cv (respectively, CvΘ ) [cf. [FrdI], Theorem 3.4, (v); [FrdII], Theorem
1.2, (i); [FrdII], Example 1.3, (i); [AbsAnab], Theorem 1.1.1, (ii)];
(d) the category Dv may be reconstructed category-theoretically either from
F v [cf. [EtTh], Theorem 4.4; [EtTh], Proposition 5.1] or from Cv [cf.
[FrdI], Theorem 3.4, (v); [FrdII], Theorem 1.2, (i); [FrdII], Example 1.3,
(i); [SemiAnbd], Example 3.10; [SemiAnbd], Remark 3.4.1].
Next, let us observe that by (b), (d), together with the discussion of (ii) concerning
the category-theoreticity of Θv , it follows [cf. Remark 3.2.1 below] that
(e) one may reconstruct the split Frobenioid FvΘ [up to the l ·Z indeterminacy
in Θv discussed in (ii); cf. also Remark 3.2.3 below] category-theoretically
from F v [cf. [FrdI], Theorem 3.4, (i), (v); [EtTh], Proposition 5.1].
Next, let us recall that the values of Θv may be computed by restricting the corresponding Kummer class, i.e., the “étale theta function” [cf. [EtTh], Proposition
1.4, (iii); the proof of [EtTh], Theorem 1.10, (ii); the proof of [EtTh], Theorem 5.7],
which may be reconstructed category-theoretically from Dv [cf. [EtTh], Corollary
2.8, (i)]. Thus, by applying the isomorphisms of cyclotomes of [AbsTopIII], Corollary 1.10, (c); [AbsTopIII], Remark 3.2.1 [cf. also [AbsTopIII], Remark 3.1.1], to
these Kummer classes, one concludes from (a), (d) that
(f) one may reconstruct the split Frobenioid Fv category-theoretically from
Cv , hence also [cf. (iii)] from F v [cf. Remark 3.2.1 below].
Remark 3.2.1.
(i) In [FrdI], [FrdII], and [EtTh] [cf. [EtTh], Remark 5.1.1], the phrase “reconstructed category-theoretically” is interpreted as meaning “preserved by equivalences
of categories”. From the point of view of the theory of [AbsTopIII] — i.e., the discussion of “mono-anabelian” versus “bi-anabelian” geometry [cf. [AbsTopIII], §I2,

74

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

(Q2)] — this sort of deﬁnition is “bi-anabelian” in nature. In fact, it is not diﬃcult
to verify that the techniques of [FrdI], [FrdII], and [EtTh] all result in explicit reconstruction algorithms, whose input data consists solely of the category structure
of the given category, of a “mono-anabelian” nature that do not require the use of
some ﬁxed reference model that arises from scheme theory [cf. the discussion of
[AbsTopIII], §I4]. For more on the foundational aspects of such “mono-anabelian
reconstruction algorithms”, we refer to the discussion of [IUTchIV], Example 3.5.
(ii) One reason that we do not develop in detail here a “mono-anabelian approach to the geometry of categories” along the lines of [AbsTopIII] is that, unlike
the case with the mono-anabelian theory of [AbsTopIII], which plays a quite essential role in the theory of the present series of papers, much of the category-theoretic
reconstruction theory of [FrdI], [FrdII], and [EtTh] is not of essential importance
in the development of the theory of the present series of papers. That is to say, for
instance, instead of quoting results to the eﬀect that the base categories or divisor
monoids of various Frobenioids may be reconstructed category-theoretically, one
could instead simply work with the data consisting of “the category constituted by
the Frobenioid equipped with its pre-Frobenioid structure” [cf. [FrdI], Deﬁnition
1.1, (iv)]. Nevertheless, we chose to apply the theory of [FrdI], [FrdII], and [EtTh]
partly because it simpliﬁes the exposition [i.e., reduces the number of auxiliary
structures that one must carry around], but more importantly because it renders
explicit precisely which structures arising from scheme-theory are “categorically
intrinsic” and which merely amount to “arbitrary, non-intrinsic choices” which,
when formulated intrinsically, correspond to various “indeterminacies”. This explicitness is of particular importance with respect to phenomena related to the unitlinear Frobenius functor [cf. [FrdI], Proposition 2.5] and the Frobenioid-theoretic
indeterminacies studied in [EtTh], §5.
Remark 3.2.2. Although the submonoid ΦCv is not “absolutely primitive” in the
sense of [FrdII], Example 1.1, (ii), it is “very close to being absolutely primitive”,
in the sense that [as is easily veriﬁed] there exists a positive integer N such that
N · ΦCv is absolutely primitive. This proximity to absolute primitiveness may also
be seen in the existence of the characteristic splittings τv .

Remark 3.2.3.
(i) Let α ∈ AutDv (Ÿ v ). Then observe that α determines, in a natural way, an

automorphism αD of the functor Dv → Dv obtained by composing the equivalence
∼
of categories Dv → DvΘ [i.e., which maps Ob(Dv )  A → AΘ ∈ Ob(DvΘ )] discussed
in Example 3.2, (v), with the natural functor DvΘ ⊆ (Dv )Ÿ → Dv . Moreover,
v

αD induces, in a natural way, an isomorphism αO of the monoid OCΘ (−) on
v

DvΘ associated to Θv in Example 3.2, (v), onto the corresponding monoid on DvΘ
associated to the α-conjugate Θα
of Θv . Thus, it follows immediately from the
v
discussion of Example 3.2, (v), that
αO — hence also α — induces an isomorphism of the split Frobenioid

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY I

75

α

FvΘ associated to Θv onto the split Frobenioid FvΘ associated to Θα
which
v
lies over the identity functor on DvΘ .
In particular, the expression “FvΘ , regarded up to the l · Z indeterminacy in Θv
discussed in Example 3.2, (ii)” may be understood as referring to the various split
α
Frobenioids “FvΘ ”, as α ranges over the elements of AutDv (Ÿ v ), relative to the
identiﬁcations given by these isomorphisms of split Frobenioids induced by the
various elements of AutDv (Ÿ v ).
(ii) Suppose that A ∈ Ob(Dv ) lies in the image of the natural functor DvΘ ⊆
(Dv )Ÿ → Dv , and that ψ : B → TA is a linear morphism in the Frobenioid F v .
v

Then ψ induces an injective homomorphism
×
÷
O× (T÷
A ) → O (B )

[cf. [FrdI], Proposition 1.11, (iv)]. In particular, one may pull-back sections of the
monoid OCΘ (−) on DvΘ of Example 3.2, (v), to B. Such pull-backs are useful, for
v

instance, when one considers the roots of Θv , as in the theory of [EtTh], §5.
Remark 3.2.4. Before proceeding, we pause to discuss certain minor oversights
on the part of the author in the discussion of the theory of tempered Frobenioids
in [EtTh], §3, §4. Let Zlog
∞ be as in the discussion at the beginning of [EtTh], §3.
log
Here, we recall that Z∞ is obtained as the “universal combinatorial covering” of
the formal log scheme associated to a stable log curve with split special ﬁber over
the ring of integers of a ﬁnite extension of an MLF of residue characteristic p [cf.
loc. cit. for more details]; we write Z log for the generic ﬁber of the stable log curve
under consideration.
(i) First, let us consider the following conditions on a nonzero meromorphic
function f on Zlog
∞:
(a) For every N ∈ N≥1 , it holds that f admits an N -th root over some
tempered covering of Z log .
(b) For every N ∈ N≥1 which is prime to p, it holds that f admits an N -th
root over some tempered covering of Z log .
(c) The divisor of zeroes and poles of f is a log-divisor.
It is immediate that (a) implies (b). Moreover, one veriﬁes immediately, by considering the ramiﬁcation divisors of the tempered coverings that arise from extracting
roots of f , that (b) implies (c). When N is prime to p, if f satisﬁes (c), then
it follows immediately from the theory of admissible coverings [cf., e.g., [PrfGC],
§2, §8] that there exists a ﬁnite log étale covering Y log → Z log whose pull-back
log
log
log
→ Z∞
to the generic ﬁber Z∞
of Zlog
Y∞
∞ is suﬃcient
(R1) to annihilate all ramiﬁcation over the cusps or special ﬁber of Zlog
∞ that

(R2) to split all extensions of the function ﬁelds of irreducible components of
the special ﬁber of Zlog
∞ that might arise from extracting an N -th root of
f.
That is to say, in this situation, it follows that f admits an N -th root over the
tempered covering of Z log given by the “universal combinatorial covering” of Y log .
In particular, it follows that (c) implies (b). Thus, in summary, we have:
(a) =⇒ (b) ⇐⇒ (c).
On the other hand, unfortunately, it is not clear to the author at the time of writing
whether or not (c) [or (b)] implies (a).
(ii) Observe that it follows from the theory of [EtTh], §1 [cf., especially, [EtTh],
Proposition 1.3] that the theta function that forms the main topic of interest of
[EtTh] satisﬁes condition (a) of (i).
(iii) In [EtTh], Deﬁnition 3.1, (ii), a meromorphic function f as in (i) is deﬁned
to be “log-meromorphic” if it satisﬁes condition (c) of (i). On the other hand, in the
proof of [EtTh], Proposition 4.2, (iii), it is necessary to use property (a) of (i) —
i.e., despite the fact that, as remarked in (i), it is not clear whether or not property
(c) implies property (a). The author apologizes for any confusion caused by this
oversight on his part.
(iv) The problem pointed out in (iii) may be remedied — at least from the
point of view of the theory of [EtTh] — via either of the following two approaches:
(A) One may modify [EtTh], Deﬁnition 3.1, (ii), by taking the deﬁnition of a
“log-meromorphic” function to be a function that satisﬁes condition (a) [i.e., as
opposed to condition (c)] of (i). [In light of the content of this modiﬁed deﬁnition,
perhaps a better term for this class of meromorphic functions would be “temperedmeromorphic”.] Then the remainder of the text of [EtTh] goes through without
change.
(B) One may modify [EtTh], Deﬁnition 4.1, (i), by assuming that the meromorphic
function “f ∈ O× (Abirat )” of [EtTh], Deﬁnition 4.1, (i), satisﬁes the following
“Frobenioid-theoretic version” of condition (a):
(d) For every N ∈ N≥1 , there exists a linear morphism A → A in C such
that the pull-back of f to A admits an N -th root.
[Here, we recall that, as discussed in (ii), the Frobenioid-theoretic theta functions
that appear in [EtTh] satisfy (d).] Note that since the rational function monoid of
the Frobenioid C, as well as the linear morphisms of C, are category-theoretic [cf.
[FrdI], Theorem 3.4, (iii), (v); [FrdI], Corollary 4.10], this condition (d) is categorytheoretic. Thus, if one modiﬁes [EtTh], Deﬁnition 4.1, (i), in this way, then the
remainder of the text of [EtTh] goes through without change, except that one must
replace the reference to the deﬁnition of “log-meromorphic” [i.e., [EtTh], Deﬁnition
3.1, (ii)] that occurs in the proof of [EtTh], Proposition 4.2, (iii), by a reference to
condition (d) [i.e., in the modiﬁed version of [EtTh], Deﬁnition 4.1, (i)].
(v) In the discussion of (iv), we note that the approach of (A) results in a
slightly diﬀerent deﬁnition of the notion of a “tempered Frobenioid” from the original

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY I

77

deﬁnition given in [EtTh]. Put another way, the approach of (B) has the advantage
that it does not result in any modiﬁcation of the deﬁnition of the notion of a
“tempered Frobenioid”; that is to say, the approach of (B) only results in a slight
reduction in the range of applicability of the theory of [EtTh], §4, which is essentially
irrelevant from the point of view of the present series of papers, since [cf. (ii)] theta
functions lie within this reduced range of applicability. On the other hand, the
approach of (A) has the advantage that one may consider the Kummer theory
of arbitrary rational functions of the tempered Frobenioid without imposing any
further hypotheses. Thus, for the sake of simplicity, in the present series of papers,
we shall interpret the notion of a “tempered Frobenioid” via the approach of (A).
(vi) Strictly speaking, the deﬁnition of the monoid “Φell
W ” given in [EtTh],
Example 3.9, (iii), leads to certain technical diﬃculties, which are, in fact, entirely
irrelevant to the theory of [EtTh]. These technical diﬃculties may be averted by
making the following slight modiﬁcations to the text of [EtTh], Example 3.9, as
follows:
(1) In the discussion following the ﬁrst display of [EtTh], Example 3.9, (i),
the phrase “Y log is of genus 1” should be replaced by the phrase “Y log is
of genus 1 and has either precisely one cusp or precisely two cusps whose
diﬀerence is a 2-torsion element of the underlying elliptic curve”.
(2) In the discussion following the ﬁrst display of [EtTh], Example 3.9, (i),
the phrase
the lower arrow of the diagram to be “Ẋ

log

→ Ċ

log

”

should be replaced by the phrase
the lower arrow of the diagram to be “Ẋ log → Ċ log ”.
(3) In the discussion following the ﬁrst display of [EtTh], Example 3.9, (ii),
the phrase “unramiﬁed over the cusps of ...” should be replaced by the
phrase “unramiﬁed over the cusps as well as over the generic points of the
irreducible components of the special ﬁbers of the stable models of ...”.
Also, the phrase “tempered coverings of the underlying ...” should be
replaced by the phrase “tempered admissible coverings of the underlying
...”.
In a word, the thrust of both the original text and the slight modiﬁcations just
discussed is that the monoid “Φell
W ” is to be deﬁned to be just large enough to
include precisely those divisors which are necessary in order to treat the theta
functions that appear in [EtTh].

Cv ⊆ Cv
[cf. [FrdII], Example 1.1, (ii), where we take “Λ” to be Z], whose base categories
are given by Dv , Dv [in a fashion compatible with the natural inclusion Dv ⊆ Dv ],
respectively. Also, we shall write

F v = Cv
[cf. the notation of Example 3.2, (i)]. Finally, let us observe that the element

(iii) Here, it is useful to recall that
(a) the subcategory Dv ⊆ Dv may be reconstructed category-theoretically
from Dv [cf. [AbsAnab], Lemma 1.3.8];
(b) the category Dv (respectively, DvΘ ) may be reconstructed category-theoretically
from Cv (respectively, CvΘ ) [cf. [FrdI], Theorem 3.4, (v); [FrdII], Theorem
1.2, (i); [FrdII], Example 1.3, (i); [AbsAnab], Theorem 1.1.1, (ii)];
(c) the category Dv may be reconstructed category-theoretically from F v = Cv
[cf. [FrdI], Theorem 3.4, (v); [FrdII], Theorem 1.2, (i); [FrdII], Example
1.3, (i); [AbsAnab], Lemma 1.3.1].
Note that it follows immediately from the category-theoreticity of the divisor monoid
ΦCv [cf. [FrdI], Corollary 4.11, (iii); [FrdII], Theorem 1.2, (i)], together with (a),
(c), and the deﬁnition of Cv [cf. also [AbsAnab], Proposition 1.2.1, (v)], that
(d) Cv may be reconstructed category-theoretically from F v .
Finally, by applying the algorithmically constructed ﬁeld structure on the image
of the Kummer map of [AbsTopIII], Proposition 3.2, (iii) [cf. Remark 3.1.2; Re
mark 3.3.2 below], it follows that one may construct the element “pv ” of OK
v

category-theoretically from F v , hence that the characteristic splitting τv may be
reconstructed category-theoretically from F v . [Here, we recall that the curve XF is
“of strictly Belyi type” — cf. [AbsTopIII], Remark 2.8.3.] In particular,
(e) one may reconstruct the split Frobenioids Fv , FvΘ category-theoretically
from F v .

“reconstructed category-theoretically”] applies to the Frobenioids Cv , Cv constructed

[cf. [FrdI], Theorem 3.4, (iii); [FrdII], Theorem 3.6, (i), (vii)] that these topological

Fv = (Cv , Dv , τv )

for the [ordered] triple consisting of Cv , Dv , and τv . Thus, the object (O (Cv ), τv )
of TM is isomorphic to Dv . Moreover, Cv (respectively, Dv ; Fv ) may be algorithmically reconstructed from F v (respectively, Dv ; F v ).
(iii) Next, let us observe that pv ∈ Kv [cf. §0] may be thought of as a(n) [nonidentity] element of the noncompact factor ΦCv [i.e., the factor denoted by a “→” in

the deﬁnition of TM ] of the object (O (Cv ), τv ) of TM . This noncompact factor
ΦCv is isomorphic, as a topological monoid, to R≥0 ; let us write ΦCv additively
and denote by log(pv ) the element of ΦCv determined by pv . Thus, relative to
the natural action [by multiplication!] of R≥0 on ΦCv , it follows that log(pv ) is a
generator of ΦCv . In particular, we may form a new topological monoid

ΦCvΘ = R≥0 · log(pv ) · log(Θ)

isomorphic to R≥0 that is generated by a formal symbol “log(pv )·log(Θ) = log(pv

DvΘ = Dv , τvΘ . Finally, we observe that FvΘ may be algorithmically reconstructed
from F v .
Remark 3.4.1. A similar remark to Remark 3.2.1 [i.e., concerning the phrase
“reconstructed category-theoretically”] applies to the phrase “algorithmically reconstructed” that was applied in the discussion of Example 3.4.
Remark 3.4.2. One way to think of the Kummer structure
κv : O (Cv ) → ADv
discussed in Example 3.4, (i), is as follows. In the terminology of [AbsTopIII], Definition 2.1, (i), (iv), the structure of CAF on ADv determines, via pull-back by κv ,
an Aut-holomorphic structure on the groupiﬁcation O (Cv )gp of O (Cv ), together
with a [tautological!] co-holomorphicization O (Cv )gp → ADv . Conversely, if one
starts with this Aut-holomorphic structure on [the groupiﬁcation of] the topological
monoid O (Cv ), together with the co-holomorphicization O (Cv )gp → ADv , then
one veriﬁes immediately that one may recover the inclusion of topological monoids
κv . [Indeed, this follows immediately from [AbsTopIII], Corollary 2.3, together
with the elementary fact that every holomorphic automorphism of the complex Lie
group C× that preserves the submonoid of elements of norm ≤ 1 is equal to the
identity.] That is to say, in summary,
the Kummer structure κv is completely equivalent to the collection
of data consisting of the Aut-holomorphic structure [induced by κv ] on
the groupiﬁcation O (Cv )gp of O (Cv ), together with the co-holomorphicization [induced by κv ] O (Cv )gp → ADv .
The signiﬁcance of thinking of Kummer structures in this way lies in the observation
that [unlike inclusions of topological monoids!]
the co-holomorphicization induced by κv is compatible with the logarithm operation discussed in [AbsTopIII], Corollary 4.5.
Indeed, this observation may be thought of as a rough summary of a substantial
portion of the content of [AbsTopIII], Corollary 4.5. Put another way, thinking of
Kummer structures in terms of co-holomorphicizations allows one to separate out
the portion of the structures involved that is not compatible with this logarithm
operation — i.e., the monoid structures! — from the portion of the structures
involved that is compatible with this logarithm operation — i.e., the tautological
co-holomorphicization.

X to “act” [cf. the algov

rithm discussed in [AbsTopIII], Corollary 2.7, (e)] on points in a suﬃciently small
neighborhood of [but not equal to!] a given point “x” of Ev , one may regard the
“circle” A×
X as a deformation retract of the complement of x in a suitable small
v

neighborhood of x in Ev . In particular,
from the point of view of the “Θ-approach” discussed in Remark 3.1.2,

of identifying the cuspidal inertia groups of the various points “x” of

1.4, (i), (ii). Indeed, this interpretation of A−

X

may be thought of as a sort of archimedean version of the “Θ-approach” discussed
in Remark 3.1.2, (ii).
(ii) We observe that just as the theory of elliptic cuspidalization [cf. [AbsTopII],
Example 3.2; [AbsTopII], Corollaries 3.3, 3.4] admits a straightforward holomorphic
analogue, i.e., the theory of “holomorphic elliptic cuspidalization” [cf. [AbsTopIII],
Corollary 2.7] referred to in (i) above, the theory of Belyi cuspidalization [cf. [AbsTopII], Example 3.6; [AbsTopII], Corollaries 3.7, 3.8; [AbsTopIII], Remark 2.8.3]
admits a straightforward holomorphic analogue, i.e., a theory of “holomorphic
Belyi cuspidalization”. We leave the routine details to the reader. Here, we observe that one immediate consequence of such “holomorphic Belyi cuspidalizations”
may be stated as follows:
the set of NF-points [i.e., points deﬁned over a number ﬁeld] of the
underlying topological space of the Aut-holomorphic space Dv may be
reconstructed via a functorial algorithm from the [abstract] Autholomorphic space Dv .

for the element determined by Θv [cf. Example 3.2, (v)] and logΦ (pv ) for the
constant section of ΦCv determined by pv [cf. the notation “logΦ (q )” of Example

(iii) One may also formulate the data contained in F

of poly-Frobenioids as developed in [FrdII], §5, but we shall not pursue this topic in
the present series of papers.

Remark 3.5.2. In Example 3.5, as well as in the following discussion, we shall
often speak of “isomorphisms of collections of data”, relative to the following conventions.
(i) Such isomorphisms are always assumed to satisfy various evident compatibility conditions, relative to the various relationships stipulated between the various
constituent data, whose explicit mention we shall omit for the sake of simplicity.
(ii) In situations where the collections of data consist partially of various categories, the portion of the “isomorphism of collections of data” involving corresponding categories is to be understood as an isomorphism class of equivalences of
categories [cf. §0].
Deﬁnition 3.6. Fix a collection of initial Θ-data (F /F, XF , l, C K , V, Vbad
mod , )
as in Deﬁnition 3.1. In the following, we shall use the various notations introduced
in Deﬁnition 3.1 for various objects associated to this initial Θ-data. Then we deﬁne
a Θ-Hodge theater [relative to the given initial Θ-data] to be a collection of data
†

that satisﬁes the following conditions:
(a) If v ∈ Vnon , then † F v is a category which admits an equivalence of cate∼

gories † F v → F v [where F v is as in Examples 3.2, (i); 3.3, (i)]. In partic-

ular, † F v admits a natural Frobenioid structure [cf. [FrdI], Corollary 4.11,

(iv)], which may be constructed solely from the category-theoretic structure of † F v . Write † Dv , † Dv , † DvΘ , † Fv , † FvΘ for the objects constructed
category-theoretically from † F v that correspond to the objects without a

“†” discussed in Examples 3.2, 3.3 [cf., especially, Examples 3.2, (vi); 3.3,
(iii)].
(b) If v ∈ Varc , then † F v is a collection of data († Cv , † Dv , † κv ) — where † Cv

is a category equivalent to the category Cv of Example 3.4, (i); † Dv is an
Aut-holomorphic orbispace; and † κv : O († Cv ) → A† Dv is an inclusion

Remark 3.6.1. When we discuss various collections of Θ-Hodge theaters, labeled
by some symbol “” in place of a “†”, we shall apply the notation of Deﬁnition 3.6
with “†” replaced by “” to denote the various objects associated to the Θ-Hodge
theater labeled by “”.
Remark 3.6.2.
If † HT Θ and ‡ HT Θ are Θ-Hodge theaters, then there is an
∼
evident notion of isomorphism of Θ-Hodge theaters † HT Θ → ‡ HT Θ [cf. Remark
3.5.2]. We leave the routine details to the interested reader.
Corollary 3.7.

Proof. The various assertions of Corollary 3.7 follow immediately from the deﬁnitions and the discussion of Examples 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5. 
Remark 3.7.1. One veriﬁes immediately that there exist many distinct isomor∼ ‡ 

discussed in Example 3.5, (ii).
The following result follows formally from Corollary 3.7.
Corollary 3.8. (Frobenius-pictures of Θ-Hodge Theaters) Fix a collection

Θ-Hodge theaters indexed by the integers. Then by applying Corollary 3.7, (i),

— i.e., where the arrows correspond to the “−→’s”, and the “•’s” correspond to the

symmetry — but it does not admit arbitrary permutation symmetries. For
instance, Γ does not admit an automorphism that switches two adjacent vertices,
but leaves the remaining vertices ﬁxed. Put another way, from the point of view of
the discussion of [FrdI], §I4, the mathematical structure constituted by this inﬁnite
chain is “Frobenius-like”, or “order-conscious”. It is for this reason that
we shall refer to this inﬁnite chain in the following discussion as the Frobeniuspicture.

Remark 3.8.1.
(i) Perhaps the central deﬁning aspect of the Frobenius-picture is the fact that
the Θ-link maps
n
Θv → (n+1) q
v

[i.e., where v ∈ Vbad — cf. the discussion of Example 3.2, (v)]. From this point of
view, the Frobenius-picture may be depicted as in Fig. 3.1 below — i.e., each box
is a Θ-Hodge theater; the “” may be thought of as denoting the scheme theory
that lies between “q ” and “Θv ”; the “- - - -” denotes the Θ-link.

Fig. 3.1: Frobenius-picture of Θ-Hodge theaters
(ii) It is perhaps not surprising [cf. the theory of [FrdI]] that the Frobeniuspicture involves, in an essential way, the divisor monoid portion [i.e., “q ” and
v

“Θv ”] of the various Frobenioids that appear in a Θ-Hodge theater. Put another
way,
it is as if the “Frobenius-like nature” of the divisor monoid portion of the
Frobenioids involved induces the “Frobenius-like nature” of the Frobeniuspicture.
By contrast, observe that for v ∈ V, the isomorphisms
∼

∼

. . . → n Dv →

(n+1)

∼

Dv → . . .

of Corollary 3.7, (ii), imply that if one thinks of the various (−) Dv as being only
known up to isomorphism, then
one may regard (−) Dv as a sort of constant invariant of the various
Θ-Hodge theaters that constitute the Frobenius-picture
— cf. Remark 3.9.1 below. This observation is the starting point of the theory of
the étale-picture [cf. Corollary 3.9, (i), below]. Note that by Corollary 3.7, (iii), we
also obtain isomorphisms
∼

∼

lying over the isomorphisms involving the “(−) Dv ” discussed above.
(iii) In the situation of (ii), suppose that v ∈ Vnon . Then (−) Dv is simply
the category of connected objects of the Galois category associated to the proﬁnite
group Gv . That is to say, one may think of (−) Dv as representing “Gv up to

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY I

isomorphism”. Then each n Dv represents an “isomorph of the topological group
Πv , labeled by n, which is regarded as an extension of some isomorph of Gv that
is independent of n”. In particular, the quotients corresponding to Gv of the
copies of Πv that arise from n HT Θ for diﬀerent n are only related to one another
via some indeterminate isomorphism. Thus, from the point of view of the theory of
[AbsTopIII] [cf. [AbsTopIII], §I3; [AbsTopIII], Remark 5.10.2, (ii)], each Πv gives
rise to a well-deﬁned ring structure — i.e., a “holomorphic structure” — which is
obliterated by the indeterminate isomorphism between the quotient isomorphs of
Gv arising from n HT Θ for distinct n.
(iv) In the situation of (ii), suppose that v ∈ Varc . Then (−) Dv is an object
of TM ; each n Dv represents an “isomorph of the Aut-holomorphic orbispace −
X ,
→
v

labeled by n, whose associated [complex archimedean] topological ﬁeld A−
X gives

v

rise to an isomorph of Dv that is independent of n”. In particular, the various
isomorphs of Dv associated to the copies of −
X v that arise from n HT Θ for diﬀerent
→
n are only related to one another via some indeterminate isomorphism. Thus, from
the point of view of the theory of [AbsTopIII] [cf. [AbsTopIII], §I3; [AbsTopIII],
Remark 5.10.2, (ii)], each −
X v gives rise to a well-deﬁned ring structure — i.e., a
→
“holomorphic structure” — which is obliterated by the indeterminate isomorphism
between the isomorphs of Dv arising from n HT Θ for distinct n.

The discussion of Remark 3.8.1, (iii), (iv), may be summarized as follows.

Fig. 3.3: Étale-picture plus units
(i) We have a diagram as in Fig. 3.2 above, which we refer to as the étalepicture. Here, each horizontal and vertical “— —” denotes the relationship between (−) Dv and Dv — i.e., an extension of topological groups when v ∈ Vnon ,
or the underlying object of TM arising from the associated topological ﬁeld when
v ∈ Varc — discussed in Remark 3.8.1, (iii), (iv). The étale-picture [unlike the
Frobenius-picture!] admits arbitrary permutation symmetries among the labels n ∈ Z corresponding to the various Θ-Hodge theaters. Put another way, the
étale-picture may be thought of as a sort of canonical splitting of the Frobeniuspicture.
(ii) In a similar vein, we have a diagram as in Fig. 3.3 above, obtained
by replacing the “Dv ” in the middle of Fig. 3.2 by “Dv  OC× ”. Here, each
v

horizontal and vertical “— —” denotes the relationship between (−) Dv and Dv
discussed in (i); when v ∈ Vnon , the notation “Dv  OC× ” denotes an isomorph
v

of the pair consisting of the category Dv together with the group-like monoid OC×
v
on Dv ; when v ∈ Varc , the notation “Dv  OC× ” denotes an isomorph of the
v
pair consisting of the object Dv ∈ Ob(TM ) and the topological group OC× [which
v

is isomorphic — but not canonically! — to the compact factor of Dv ]. Just as in
the case of (i), this diagram admits arbitrary permutation symmetries among
the labels n ∈ Z corresponding to the various Θ-Hodge theaters.
Remark 3.9.1. If one formulates things relative to the language of [AbsTopIII],
Deﬁnition 3.5, then (−) Dv constitutes a core. Relative to the theory of [AbsTopIII],
§5, this core is essentially the mono-analytic core discussed in [AbsTopIII], §I3;
[AbsTopIII], Remark 5.10.2, (ii). Indeed, the symbol “” is intended — both in
[AbsTopIII] and in the present series of papers! — as an abbreviation for the term
“mono-analytic”.

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY I

93

Remark 3.9.2. Whereas the étale-picture of Corollary 3.9, (i), will remain valid
throughout the development of the remainder of the theory of the present series of
papers, the local units “OC× ” that appear in Corollary 3.9, (ii), will ultimately cease
v

to be a constant invariant of various enhanced versions of the Frobenius-picture that
will arise in the theory of [IUTchIII]. In a word, these enhancements revolve around
the incorporation into each Hodge theater of the “rotation of addition [i.e., ‘’]
and multiplication [i.e., ‘’]” in the style of the theory of [AbsTopIII].
Remark 3.9.3.
(i) As discussed in [AbsTopIII], §I3; [AbsTopIII], Remark 5.10.2, (ii), the
“mono-analytic core” {Dv }v∈V may be thought of as a sort of ﬁxed underlying real-analytic surface associated to a number ﬁeld on which various holomorphic structures are imposed. Then the Frobenius-picture in its entirety may
be thought of as a sort of global arithmetic analogue of the notion of a Teichmüller geodesic in classical complex Teichmüller theory or, alternatively, as a
global arithmetic analogue of the canonical liftings of p-adic Teichmüller theory
[cf. the discussion of [AbsTopIII], §I5].
(ii) Recall that in classical complex Teichmüller theory, one of the two real dimensions of the surface is dilated as one moves along a Teichmüller geodesic, while
the other of the two real dimensions is held ﬁxed. In the case of the Frobeniuspicture of Corollary 3.8, the local units “O× ” correspond to the dimension that
is held ﬁxed, while the local value groups are subject to “Θ-dilations” as one
moves along the diagram constituted by the Frobenius-picture. Note that in order
to construct such a mathematical structure in which the local units and local value
groups are treated independently, it is of crucial importance to avail oneself of
the various characteristic splittings that appear in the split Frobenioids of Examples 3.2, 3.3, 3.4. Here, we note in passing that, in the case of Example 3.2,
this splitting corresponds to the “constant multiple rigidity” of the étale theta
function, which forms a central theme of the theory of [EtTh].
(iii) In classical complex Teichmüller theory, the two real dimensions of the
surface that are treated independently of one another correspond to the real and
imaginary parts of the coordinate obtained by locally integrating the square root
of a given square diﬀerential. In particular, it is of crucial importance in classical
complex Teichmüller theory that these real and imaginary parts not be “subject to
confusion with one another”. In the case of the square root of a square diﬀerential,
the only indeterminacy that arises is indeterminacy with respect to multiplication
by −1, an operation that satisﬁes the crucial property of preserving the real and
imaginary parts of a complex number. By contrast, it is interesting to note that
if, for n ≥ 3, one attempts to construct Teichmüller deformations in the
fashion of classical complex Teichmüller theory by means of coordinates
obtained by locally integrating the n-th root of a given section of the nth tensor power of the sheaf of diﬀerentials, then one must contend with
an indeterminacy with respect to multiplication by an n-th root of unity,
an operation that results in an essential confusion between the real and
imaginary parts of a complex number.

94

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

(iv) Whereas linear movement along the oriented graph Γ of Corollary 3.8 corresponds to the linear ﬂow along a Teichmüller geodesic, the “rotation of addition
[i.e., ‘’] and multiplication [i.e., ‘’]” in the style of the theory of [AbsTopIII]
— which will be incorporated into the theory of the present series of papers in
[IUTchIII] [cf. Remark 3.9.2] — corresponds to rotations around a ﬁxed point in
the complex geometry arising from Teichmüller theory [cf., e.g., the discussion of
[AbsTopIII], §I3; the hyperbolic geometry of the upper half-plane, regarded as the
“Teichmüller space” of compact Riemann surfaces of genus 1]. Alternatively, in the
analogy with p-adic Teichmüller theory, this “rotation of  and ” corresponds
to the Frobenius morphism in positive characteristic — cf. the discussion of [AbsTopIII], §I5.
Remark 3.9.4.

At ﬁrst glance, the assignment “n Θv → (n+1) q ” [cf. Remark
v

3.8.1, (i)] may strike the reader as being nothing more than a “conventional evaluation map” [i.e., of the theta function at a torsion point — cf. the discussion of
Example 3.2, (iv)]. Although we shall ultimately be interested, in the theory of the
present series of papers, in such “Hodge-Arakelov-style evaluation maps” [within
a ﬁxed Hodge theater!] of the theta function at torsion points [cf. the theory of
[IUTchII]], the Θ-link considered here diﬀers quite fundamentally from such conventional evaluation maps in the following respect:
the value (n+1) q

v

belongs to a distinct scheme theory — i.e., the

scheme theory represented by the distinct Θ-Hodge theater (n+1) HT Θ —
from the base n q [which belongs to the scheme theory represented by the
v
n

Θ-Hodge theater HT Θ ] over which the theta function n Θv is constructed.
The distinctness of the ring/scheme theories of distinct Θ-Hodge theaters may be
seen, for instance, in the indeterminacy of the isomorphism between the associated
isomorphs of Dv , an indeterminacy which has the eﬀect of obliterating the ring
structure — i.e., the “arithmetic holomorphic structure” — associated to n Dv for
distinct n [cf. the discussion of Remark 3.8.1, (iii), (iv)].

Section 4: Multiplicative Combinatorial Teichmüller Theory
In the present §4, we begin to prepare for the construction of the various

precisely, in the present §4, we discuss the combinatorial aspects of the “D” — i.e.,
in the terminology of the theory of Frobenioids, the “base category” — portion of the
notions to be introduced in §5 below. In a word, these combinatorial aspects revolve

In the following, we ﬁx a collection of initial Θ-data

Deﬁnition 4.1.

given initial Θ-data] to be a collection of data
†

D = {† Dv }v∈V

that satisﬁes the following conditions: (a) if v ∈ Vnon , then † Dv is a category which
∼
admits an equivalence of categories † Dv → Dv [where Dv is as in Examples 3.2, (i);
3.3, (i)]; (b) if v ∈ Varc , then † Dv is an Aut-holomorphic orbispace such that there
∼
exists an isomorphism of Aut-holomorphic orbispaces † Dv → Dv [where Dv is as in
Example 3.4, (i)]. Observe that if v ∈ Vnon , then π1 († Dv ) determines, in a functorial
fashion, a topological [in fact, proﬁnite if v ∈ Vgood ] group corresponding to “C v ”
[cf. Corollary 1.2 if v ∈ Vgood ; [EtTh], Proposition 2.4, if v ∈ Vbad ], which contains
π1 († Dv ) as an open subgroup; thus, if we write † Dv for B(−)0 of this topological
group, then we obtain a natural morphism † Dv → † Dv [cf. §0]. In a similar vein, if
v ∈ Varc , then since −
X
→v admits a Kv -core, a routine translation into the “language
of Aut-holomorphic orbispaces” of the argument given in the proof of Corollary 1.2
[cf. also [AbsTopIII], Corollary 2.4] reveals that † Dv determines, in a functorial
fashion, an Aut-holomorphic orbispace † Dv corresponding to “C v ”, together with
a natural morphism † Dv → † Dv of Aut-holomorphic orbispaces. Thus, in summary,
one obtains a collection of data

completely determined by † D.
(ii) Suppose that we are in the situation of (i). Then observe that by applying
the group-theoretic algorithm of [AbsTopI], Lemma 4.5 [cf., especially, [AbsTopI],
Lemma 4.5, (v), as well as Remark 1.2.2, (ii), of the present paper], to construct
the set of conjugacy classes of cuspidal decomposition groups of the topological
group π1 († Dv ) when v ∈ Vnon , or by considering π0 (−) of a coﬁnal collection of
“neighborhoods of inﬁnity” [i.e., complements of compact subsets] of the underlying
topological space of † Dv when v ∈ Varc , it makes sense to speak of the set of cusps
of † Dv ; a similar observation applies to † Dv , for v ∈ V. If v ∈ V, then we deﬁne
a label class of cusps of † Dv to be the set of cusps of † Dv that lie over a single
“nonzero cusp” [i.e., a cusp that arises from a nonzero element of the quotient “Q”
that appears in the deﬁnition of a “hyperbolic orbicurve of type (1, l-tors)± ” given
in [EtTh], Deﬁnition 2.1] of † Dv ; write
LabCusp(† Dv )
for the set of label classes of cusps of † Dv . Thus, for each v ∈ V, LabCusp(† Dv )
admits a natural F
l -torsor structure [i.e., which arises from the natural action of
×
Fl on the quotient “Q” of [EtTh], Deﬁnition 2.1]. Moreover, [for any v ∈ V!] one
may construct, solely from † Dv , a canonical element
†

η v ∈ LabCusp(† Dv )

determined by “v ” [cf. the notation of Deﬁnition 3.1, (f)]. [Indeed, this follows
 non
V ,
from [EtTh], Corollary 2.9, for v ∈ Vbad , from Corollary 1.2 for v ∈ Vgood
and from the evident translation into the “language of Aut-holomorphic orbispaces”
of Corollary 1.2 for v ∈ Varc .]
(iii) We deﬁne a mono-analytic base-prime-strip, or D -prime-strip, [relative
to the given initial Θ-data] to be a collection of data
†

D = {† Dv }v∈V

that satisﬁes the following conditions: (a) if v ∈ Vnon , then † Dv is a category which
∼
admits an equivalence of categories † Dv → Dv [where Dv is as in Examples 3.2,
(i); 3.3, (i)]; (b) if v ∈ Varc , then † Dv is an object of the category TM [so, if Dv
∼
is as in Example 3.4, (ii), then there exists an isomorphism † Dv → Dv in TM ].
(iv) A morphism of D- (respectively, D -) prime-strips is deﬁned to be a collection of morphisms, indexed by V, between the various constituent objects of the
prime-strips. Following the conventions of §0, one thus has a notion of capsules of
D- (respectively, D -) and morphisms of capsules of D- (respectively, D -) primestrips. Note that to any D-prime-strip † D, one may associate, in a natural way,
a D -prime-strip † D — which we shall refer to as the mono-analyticization of
†
D — by considering appropriate subcategories at the nonarchimedean primes [cf.
Examples 3.2, (i), (vi); 3.3, (i), (iii)], or by applying the construction of Example
3.4, (ii), at the archimedean primes.

D = B(C K )0
def

[cf. §0]. Then recall from [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9 [cf. Remark 3.1.2], that
there exists a group-theoretic algorithm for reconstructing, from π1 (D ) [cf. §0],
the algebraic closure “F ” of the base ﬁeld “K”, hence also the set of valuations
“V(F )” [e.g., as a collection of topologies on F — cf., e.g., [AbsTopIII], Corollary
2.8]. Moreover, for w ∈ V(K)arc , let us recall [cf. Remark 3.1.2; [AbsTopIII],
Corollaries 2.8, 2.9] that one may reconstruct group-theoretically, from π1 (D ), the
Aut-holomorphic orbispace Cw associated to C w . Let † D be a category equivalent
to D . Then let us write
V(† D )
for the set of valuations [i.e., “V(F )”], equipped with its natural π1 († D )-action,
V(† D )

def

=

V(† D )/π1 († D )

for the quotient of V(† D ) by π1 († D ) [i.e., “V(K)”], and, for w ∈ V(† D )arc ,
C(† D , w)
[i.e., “Cw ” — cf. the discussion of [AbsTopIII], Deﬁnition 5.1, (ii)] for the Autholomorphic orbispace obtained by applying these group-theoretic reconstruction
algorithms to π1 († D ). Now if U is an arbitrary Aut-holomorphic orbispace, then
let us deﬁne a morphism
U → † D
to be a morphism of Aut-holomorphic orbispaces [cf. [AbsTopIII], Deﬁnition 2.1,
(ii)] U → C(† D , w) for some w ∈ V(† D )arc . Thus, it makes sense to speak of the
pre-composite (respectively, post-composite) of such a morphism U → † D with
a morphism of Aut-holomorphic orbispaces (respectively, with an isomorphism [cf.
∼
§0] † D → ‡ D [i.e., where ‡ D is a category equivalent to D ]). Finally, just as in
 non
V ”, we may apply [AbsTopI],
the discussion of (ii) in the case of “v ∈ Vgood
Lemma 4.5 [cf. also Remark 1.2.2, (ii), of the present paper], to conclude that it
makes sense to speak of the set of cusps of † D , as well as the set of label classes
of cusps
LabCusp(† D )
of † D , which admits a natural F
l -torsor structure.
(vi) Let † D be a category equivalent to D , † D = {† Dv }v∈V a D-primestrip. If v ∈ V, then we deﬁne a poly-morphism † Dv → † D to be a collection of
morphisms † Dv → † D [cf. §0 when v ∈ Vnon ; (v) when v ∈ Varc ]. We deﬁne a
poly-morphism
†
D → † D
to be a collection of poly-morphisms {† Dv → † D }v∈V . Finally, if {e D}e∈E is a
capsule of D-prime-strips, then we deﬁne a poly-morphism
{e D}e∈E → † D (respectively, {e D}e∈E → † D)

98

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

to be a collection of poly-morphisms {e D → † D }e∈E (respectively, {e D → † D}e∈E ).
The following result follows immediately from the discussion of Deﬁnition 4.1,
(ii).
Proposition 4.2. (The Set of Label Classes of Cusps of a Base-PrimeStrip) Let † D = {† Dv }v∈V be a D-prime-strip. Then for any v, w ∈ V, there
exist bijections
∼
LabCusp(† Dv ) → LabCusp(† Dw )
that are uniquely determined by the condition that they be compatible with
the assignments † η v → † η w [cf. Deﬁnition 4.1, (ii)], as well as with the F
l torsor structures on either side. In particular, these bijections are preserved
by arbitrary isomorphisms of D-prime-strips. Thus, by identifying the various
“LabCusp(† Dv )” via these bijections, it makes sense to write LabCusp(† D).
Finally, LabCusp(† D) is equipped with a canonical element, arising from the † η v
[for v ∈ V], as well as a natural F
l -torsor structure; in particular, this canonical

element and Fl -torsor structure determine a natural bijection
LabCusp(† D)

∼

→

F
l

that is preserved by isomorphisms of D-prime-strips.
Remark 4.2.1.
Note that if, in Examples 3.3, 3.4 — i.e., at v ∈ Vgood —
X
one deﬁnes “Dv ” by means of “C v ” instead of “−
→v ”, then there does not exist
a system of bijections as in Proposition 4.2. Indeed, by the Tchebotarev density
theorem [cf., e.g., [Lang], Chapter VIII, §4, Theorem 10], it follows immediately that
there exist v ∈ V such that, for a suitable embedding Gal(K/F ) → GL2 (Fl ), the
decomposition subgroup in Gal(K/F ) → GL2 (Fl ) determined [up to conjugation]
by v is equal to the subgroup of diagonal matrices with determinant 1. Thus, if
†
D = {† Dv }v∈V , † D = {† Dv }v∈V are as in Deﬁnition 4.1, (i), then for such a v, the
automorphism group of † Dv acts transitively on the set of label classes of cusps of
†
Dv , while the automorphism group of † Dw acts trivially [by [EtTh], Corollary 2.9]
on the set of label classes of cusps of † Dw for any w ∈ Vbad .
Example 4.3.
Model Base-NF-Bridges. In the following, we construct the
“models” for the notion of a “base-NF-bridge” [cf. Deﬁnition 4.6, (i), below].

Corollary 3.3, (i), (ii); [AbsTopII], Remark 3.3.2; [AbsTopI], Example 4.8]. Since

inner automorphisms of ΠC K clearly act by multiplication by ±1 on the l-torsion
points of EF [i.e., on Δab
X ⊗ Fl ], we obtain a natural homomorphism Out(ΠC K ) →
ab
Aut(ΔX ⊗ Fl )/{±1}. Thus, it follows immediately from the discussion of the notation “K”, “C K ”, and “” in Deﬁnition 3.1, (c), (d), (f) [cf. also Remark 3.1.5; the
discussion preceding [EtTh], Deﬁnition 2.1; the discussion of [EtTh], Remark 2.6.1],

Remark 4.3.1.
(i) Suppose, for simplicity, in the following discussion that F = Fmod . Note
that the morphism of schemes Spec(K) → Spec(F ) [or, equivalently, the homomorphism of rings F → K] does not admit a section. This nonexistence of a section
is closely related to the nonexistence of a “global multiplicative subspace” of the
sort discussed in [HASurII], Remark 3.7. In the context of loc. cit., this nonexistence of a “global multiplicative subspace” may be thought of as a concrete way
of representing the principal obstruction to applying the scheme-theoretic HodgeArakelov theory of [HASurI], [HASurII] to diophantine geometry. From this point
of view, if one thinks of the ring structure of F , K as a sort of “arithmetic holomorphic structure” [cf. [AbsTopIII], Remark 5.10.2, (ii)], then one may think of
the [D-]prime-strips that appear in the discussion of Example 4.3 as deﬁning, via
of Example 4.3, (iv),
the arrows φNF
j
“arithmetic collections of local analytic sections” of Spec(K) → Spec(F )
— cf. Fig. 4.1 below, where each “· − · − . . . − · − ·” represents a [D-]prime-strip.
In fact, if, for the sake of brevity, we abbreviate the phrase “collection of local analytic” by the term “local-analytic”, then each of these sections may be thought of
as yielding not only an “arithmetic local-analytic global multiplicative subspace”, but also an “arithmetic local-analytic global canonical generator”
[i.e., up to multiplication by ±1, of the quotient of the module of l-torsion points of
the elliptic curve in question by the “arithmetic local-analytic global multiplicative
subspace”]. We refer to Remark 4.9.1, (i), below, for more on this point of view.

Fig. 4.1: Prime-strips as “sections” of Spec(K) → Spec(F )
(ii) The way in which these “arithmetic local-analytic sections” constituted
by the [D-]prime-strips fail to be [globally] “arithmetically holomorphic” may be
understood from several closely related points of view. The ﬁrst point of view was
already noted above in (i) — namely:
(a) these sections fail to extend to ring homomorphisms K → F .
The second point of view involves the classical phenomenon of decomposition of
primes in extensions of number ﬁelds. The decomposition of primes in extensions

102

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

of number ﬁelds may be represented by a tree, as in Fig. 4.2, below. If one thinks
of the tree in large parentheses of Fig. 4.2 as representing the decomposition of
primes over a prime v of F in extensions of F [such as K!], then the “arithmetic
local-analytic sections” constituted by the D-prime-strips may be thought of as
(b) an isomorphism, or identiﬁcation, between v [i.e., a prime of F ] and
v  [i.e., a prime of K] which [manifestly — cf., e.g., [NSW], Theorem
12.2.5] fails to extend to an isomorphism between the respective prime
decomposition trees over v and v  .
If one thinks of the relation “∈” between sets in axiomatic set theory as determining
a “tree”, then
the point of view of (b) is reminiscent of the point of view of [IUTchIV], §3,
where one is concerned with constructing some sort of artiﬁcial solution to
the “membership equation a ∈ a” [cf. the discussion of [IUTchIV], Remark
3.3.1, (i)].
The third point of view consists of the observation that although the “arithmetic
local-analytic sections” constituted by the D-prime-strips involve isomorphisms of
the various local absolute Galois groups,
(c) these isomorphisms of local absolute Galois groups fail to extend to a
section of global absolute Galois groups GF  GK [i.e., a section of the
natural inclusion GK → GF ].
Here, we note that in fact, by the Neukirch-Uchida theorem [cf. [NSW], Chapter
XII, §2], one may think of (a) and (c) as essentially equivalent. Moreover, (b) is
closely related to this equivalence, in the sense that the proof [cf., e.g., [NSW],
Chapter XII, §2] of the Neukirch-Uchida theorem depends in an essential fashion
on a careful analysis of the prime decomposition trees of the number ﬁelds involved.

(iii) In some sense, understanding more precisely the content of the failure of
these “arithmetic local-analytic sections” constituted by the D-prime-strips to be
“arithmetically holomorphic” is a central theme of the theory of the present series
of papers — a theme which is very much in line with the spirit of classical complex
Teichmüller theory.
Remark 4.3.2. The incompatibility of the “arithmetic local-analytic sections” of
Remark 4.3.1, (i), with global prime distributions and global absolute Galois groups
[cf. the discussion of Remark 4.3.1, (ii)] is precisely the technical obstacle that

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY I

103

will necessitate the application — in [IUTchIII] — of the absolute p-adic monoanabelian geometry developed in [AbsTopIII], in the form of “panalocalization along
the various prime-strips” [cf. [IUTchIII] for more details]. Indeed,
the mono-anabelian theory developed in [AbsTopIII] represents the culmination of earlier research of the author during the years 2000 to 2007
concerning absolute p-adic anabelian geometry — research that was
motivated precisely by the goal of developing a geometry that would allow
one to work with the “arithmetic local-analytic sections” constituted by
the prime-strips, so as to overcome the principal technical obstruction to
applying the Hodge-Arakelov theory of [HASurI], [HASurII] [cf. Remark
4.3.1, (i)].
Note that the “desired geometry” in question will also be subject to other requirements. For instance, in [IUTchIII] [cf. also [IUTchII], §4], we shall make essential
use of the global arithmetic — i.e., the ring structure and absolute Galois groups —
of number ﬁelds. As observed above in Remark 4.3.1, (ii), these global arithmetic
structures are not compatible with the “arithmetic local-analytic sections” constituted by the prime-strips. In particular, this state of aﬀairs imposes the further
requirement that the “geometry” in question be compatible with globalization, i.e.,
that it give rise to the global arithmetic of the number ﬁelds in question in a fashion
that is independent of the various local geometries that appear in the “arithmetic
local-analytic sections” constituted by the prime-strips, but nevertheless admits localization operations to these various local geometries [cf. Fig. 4.3; the discussion
of [IUTchII], Remark 4.11.2, (iii); [AbsTopIII], Remark 3.7.6, (iii), (v)].

Fig. 4.3: Globalizability
Finally, in order for the “desired geometry” to be applicable to the theory developed
in the present series of papers, it is necessary for it to be based on “étale-like
structures”, so as to give rise to canonical splittings, as in the étale-picture discussed
in Corollary 3.9, (i). Thus, in summary, the requirements that we wish to impose
on the “desired geometry” are the following:
(a) local independence of global structures,
(b) globalizability, in a fashion that is independent of local structures,
(c) the property of being based on étale-like structures.
Note, in particular, that properties (a), (b) at ﬁrst glance almost appear to contradict one another. In particular, the simultaneous realization of (a), (b) is highly

104

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

nontrivial. For instance, in the case of a function ﬁeld of dimension one over a
base ﬁeld, the simultaneous realization of properties (a), (b) appears to require
that one restrict oneself essentially to working with structures that descend to the
base ﬁeld! It is thus a highly nontrivial consequence of the theory of [AbsTopIII]
that the mono-anabelian geometry of [AbsTopIII] does indeed satisfy all of these
requirements (a), (b), (c) [cf. the discussion of [AbsTopIII], §I1].
Remark 4.3.3.
(i) One important theme of [AbsTopIII] is the analogy between the monoanabelian theory of [AbsTopIII] and the theory of Frobenius-invariant indigenous bundles of the sort that appear in p-adic Teichmüller theory [cf. [AbsTopIII],
§I5]. In fact, [although this point of view is not mentioned in [AbsTopIII]] one may
“compose” this analogy with the analogy between the p-adic and complex theories discussed in [pOrd], Introduction; [pTeich], Introduction, §0, and consider the
analogy between the mono-anabelian theory of [AbsTopIII] and the classical geometry of the upper half-plane H. In addition to being more elementary than
the p-adic theory, this analogy with the classical geometry of the upper half-plane
H also has the virtue that
since it revolves around the canonical Kähler metric — i.e., the Poincaré metric — on the upper half-plane, it renders more transparent the
relationship between the theory of the present series of papers and classical Arakelov theory [which also revolves, to a substantial extent, around
Kähler metrics at the archimedean primes].
(ii) The essential content of the mono-anabelian theory of [AbsTopIII] may be
summarized by the diagram

— where k is a ﬁnite extension of Qp ; k is an algebraic closure of k; Π is the arithmetic fundamental group of a hyperbolic orbicurve over k; log is the p-adic logarithm [cf. [AbsTopIII], §I1]. On the other hand, if (E, ∇E ) denotes the “tautological
indigenous bundle” on H [i.e., the ﬁrst de Rham cohomology of the tautological

is the canonical Kähler metric [i.e., Poincaré metric] on H. Then one can already
identify various formal similarities between κH and the diagram (∗) reviewed above:
Indeed, at a purely formal [but by no means coincidental!] level, the “log” that

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY I

appears in the deﬁnition of κH is reminiscent of the “log-Frobenius operation” log.
At a less formal level, the “Galois group” Π is reminiscent — cf. the point of view
that “Galois groups are arithmetic tangent bundles”, a point of view that underlies
the theory of the arithmetic Kodaira-Spencer morphism discussed in [HASurI]! —
of ∂. If one thinks of complex conjugation as a sort of “archimedean Frobenius” [cf.
[pTeich], Introduction, §0], then ∂ is reminiscent of the “Galois group” Π operating
on the opposite side [cf. ιE ] of the log-Frobenius operation log. The Hodge ﬁltration
of E corresponds to the ring structures of the copies of k on either side of log [cf.
the discussion of [AbsTopIII], Remark 3.7.2]. Finally, perhaps most importantly
from the point of view of the theory of the present series of papers:
the fact that log-shells play the role in the theory of [AbsTopIII] of “canonical rigid integral structures” [cf. [AbsTopIII], §I1] — i.e., “canonical standard units of volume” — is reminiscent of the fact that the Kähler metric
κH also plays the role of determining a canonical notion of volume on H.
(iii) From the point of view of the analogy discussed in (ii), property (a) of
Remark 4.3.2 may be thought of as corresponding to the local representability via the [positive] (1, 1)-form κH — on, say, a compact quotient S of H — of
the [positive] global degree of [the result of descending to S] the line bundle ω;
property (b) of Remark 4.3.2 may be thought of as corresponding to the fact that
this (1, 1)-form κH that gives rise to a local representation on S of the notion of
a positive global degree not only exists locally on S, but also admits a canonical
global extension to the entire Riemann surface S which may be related to the
algebraic theory [i.e., of algebraic rational functions on S].
(iv) The analogy discussed in (ii) may be summarized as follows:

the Galois group Π
on the opposite side of log
the ring structures of the copies

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

[i.e., the set of {±1}-orbits of Fl ] and the set of cusps of the hyperbolic orbicurve
C v [cf. [EtTh], Corollary 2.9]. Thus, [by considering ﬁbers over C v ] we obtain
labels ∈ |Fl | of various collections of cusps of X v , X v . Write
μ− ∈ X v (Kv )
for the unique torsion point of order 2 whose closure in any stable model of X v
over OKv intersects the same irreducible component of the special ﬁber of the stable
model as the [unique] cusp labeled 0 ∈ |Fl |. Now observe that it makes sense to
speak of the points ∈ X v (Kv ) obtained as μ− -translates of the cusps, relative to the
group scheme structure of the elliptic curve determined by X v [i.e., whose origin
is given by the cusp labeled 0 ∈ |Fl |]. We shall refer to these μ− -translates of the
cusps with labels ∈ |Fl | as the evaluation points of X v . Note that the value of
the theta function “Θv ” of Example 3.2, (ii), at a point lying over an evaluation
point arising from a cusp with label j ∈ |Fl | is contained in the μ2l -orbit of
{q

}j≡j

[cf. Example 3.2, (iv); [EtTh], Proposition 1.4, (ii)] — where j ranges over the
elements of Z that map to j ∈ |Fl |. In particular, it follows immediately from the
deﬁnition of the covering X v → X v [i.e., by considering l-th roots of the theta
function! — cf. [EtTh], Deﬁnition 2.5, (i)] that the points of X v that lie over
evaluation points of X v are all deﬁned over Kv . We shall refer to the points
∈ X v (Kv ) that lie over the evaluation points of X v as the evaluation points of X v
and to the various sections
Gv → Πv = Πtp
X
v

of the natural surjection Πv  Gv that arise from the evaluation points as the
evaluation sections of Πv  Gv . Thus, each evaluation section has an associated label ∈ |Fl |. Note that there is a group-theoretic algorithm for constructing
the evaluation sections from [isomorphs of] the topological group Πv . Indeed, this
follows immediately from [the proofs of] [EtTh], Corollary 2.9 [concerning the grouptheoreticity of the labels]; [EtTh], Proposition 2.4 [concerning the group-theoreticity
of ΠC v , ΠX v ]; [SemiAnbd], Corollary 3.11 [concerning the dual semi-graphs of the

v j , the induced homomorphism
π1 (Dvj ) → π1 (D>,v ) [well-deﬁned, up to composition with an inner automorphism]
is compatible with the respective outer actions [of the domain and codomain of this
homomorphism] on π1geo (Dvj ), π1geo (D>,v ) for some [not necessarily unique, but
determined up to ﬁnite ambiguity — cf. [SemiAnbd], Theorem 6.4!] outer isomor∼

the [discrete] topological fundamental group π1 (Dvj ) to the proﬁnite group π1 (D );
thus,
by considering the closures in π1 (D ) of the images of cuspidal inertia

we conclude that these homomorphisms induce a natural isomorphism of F

from the deﬁnitions that, as one allows v to vary, these isomorphisms of F

Remark 4.5.1.
(i) Let G be a group. If H ⊆ G is a subgroup, g ∈ G, then we shall write
g def

H = g · H · g −1 . Let J ⊆ H ⊆ G be subgroups. Suppose further that each of the

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY I

109

subgroups J, H of G is only known up to conjugacy in G. Put another way, we
suppose that we are in a situation in which there are independent G-conjugacy
indeterminacies in the speciﬁcation of the subgroups J and H. Thus, for instance,
there is no natural way to distinguish the given inclusion ι : J → H from its γconjugate ιγ : J γ → H γ , for γ ∈ G. Moreover, it may happen to be the case that
−1
for some g ∈ G, not only J, but also J g ⊆ H [or, equivalently J ⊆ H g ]. Here, the
subgroups J, J g of H are not necessarily conjugate in H; indeed, the abstract pairs
of a group and a subgroup given by (H, J) and (H, J g ) need not be isomorphic
[i.e., it is not even necessarily the case that there exists an automorphism of H
that maps J onto J g ]. In particular, the existence of the independent G-conjugacy
indeterminacies in the speciﬁcation of J and H means that one cannot specify the
−1
inclusion ι : J → H independently of the inclusion ζ : J → H g [i.e., arising from
out

J g ⊆ H]. One way to express this state of aﬀairs is as follows. Write “ → ”
for the outer homomorphism determined by an injective homomorphism between
out
out
groups. Then the collection of factorizations J → H → G of the natural
out
“outer” inclusion J → G through some G-conjugate of H — i.e., put another
way,
the collection of outer homomorphisms
J

out

→

H

that are compatible with the “structure morphisms” J
out
H → G determined by the natural inclusions

out

→

G,

— is well-deﬁned, in a fashion that is compatible with independent G-conjugacy
indeterminacies in the speciﬁcation of J and H. That is to say, this collection
of outer homomorphisms amounts to the collection of inclusions J g1 → H g2 , for
g1 , g2 ∈ G. By contrast, to specify the inclusion ι : J → H [together with, say,
−1
its G-conjugates {ιγ }γ∈G ] independently of the inclusion ζ : J → H g [and its Gconjugates {ζ γ }γ∈G ] amounts to the imposition of a partial synchronization —
i.e., a partial deactivation — of the [a priori!] independent G-conjugacy indeterminacies in the speciﬁcation of J and H. Moreover, such a “partial deactivation”
can only be eﬀected at the cost of introducing certain arbitrary choices into the
construction under consideration.
(ii) Relative to the factorizations considered in (i), we make the following
observation. Given a G-conjugate H ∗ of H and a subgroup I ⊆ H ∗ , the condition
on I that
(∗⊆ ) I be a G-conjugate of J
is a condition that is independent of the datum H ∗ , while the condition on I that
∼
(∗= ) I be a G-conjugate of J such that (H ∗ , I) ∼
= (H, J)

[where the “∼
=” denotes an isomorphism of pairs consisting of a group and a subgroup — cf. the discussion of (i)] is a condition that depends, in an essential fashion,
on the datum H ∗ . Here, (∗⊆ ) is precisely the condition that one must impose when
∼
one considers arbitrary factorizations as in (i), while (∗= ) is the condition that one
must impose when one wishes to restrict one’s attention to factorizations whose

110

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

ﬁrst arrow gives rise to a pair isomorphic to the pair determined by ι. That is to
∼
say, the dependence of (∗= ) on the datum H ∗ may be regarded as an explicit formulation of the necessity for the “imposition of a partial synchronization” as discussed
in (i), while the corresponding independence, exhibited by (∗⊆ ), of the datum H ∗
may be regarded as an explicit formulation of the lack of such a necessity when one
considers arbitrary factorizations as in (i). Finally, we note that by reversing the
direction of the inclusion “⊆”, one may consider a subgroup I ⊆ G that contains a
given G-conjugate J ∗ of J, i.e., I ⊇ J ∗ ; then analogous observations may be made
concerning the condition (∗⊇ ) on I that I be a G-conjugate of H.
(iii) The abstract situation described in (i) occurs in the discussion of Example
4.5, (i), at v ∈ Vbad . That is to say, the group “G” (respectively, “H”; “J”) of (i)
corresponds to the group π1 (D ) (respectively, the image of π1 (Dvj ) in π1 (D ); the
unique index l open subgroup of a cuspidal inertia group of π1 (D )) of Example 4.5,
(i). Here, we recall that the homomorphism π1 (Dvj ) → π1 (D ) is only known up to
composition with an inner automorphism — i.e., up to π1 (D )-conjugacy; a cuspidal inertia group of π1 (D ) is also only determined by an element ∈ LabCusp(D )
up to π1 (D )-conjugacy. Moreover, it is immediate from the construction of the
“model D-NF-bridges” of Example 4.3 [cf. also Deﬁnition 4.6, (i), below] that there
is no natural way to synchronize these indeterminacies. Indeed, from the
point of view of the discussion of Remark 4.3.1, (ii), by considering the actions of
the absolute Galois groups of the local and global base ﬁelds involved on the cuspidal inertia groups that appear, one sees that such a synchronization would amount,
roughly speaking, to a Galois-equivariant splitting [i.e., relative to the global absolute Galois groups that appear] of the “prime decomposition trees” of Remark 4.3.1,
(ii) — which is absurd [cf. [IUTchII], Remark 2.5.2, (iii), for a more detailed discussion of this sort of phenomenon]. This phenomenon of the “non-synchronizability”
of indeterminacies arising from local and global absolute Galois groups is reminiscent of the discussion of [EtTh], Remark 2.16.2. On the other hand, by Corollary
2.5, one concludes in the present situation the highly nontrivial fact that
a factorization “J → H → G” is uniquely determined by the composite J → G, i.e., by the G-conjugate of J that one starts with, without
resorting to any a priori “synchronization of indeterminacies”.
(iv) A similar situation to the situation of (iii) occurs in the discussion of
Example 4.5, (i), at v ∈ Varc . That is to say, in this case, the group “G” (respectively, “H”; “J”) of (i) corresponds to the group π1 (D ) (respectively, the
image of π1 (Dvj ) in π1 (D ); a cuspidal inertia group of π1 (Dvj )) of Example 4.5,
(i). In this case, although it does not hold that a factorization “J → H → G” is
uniquely determined by the composite J → G, i.e., by the G-conjugate of J that
one starts with [cf. Remark 2.6.1], it does nevertheless hold, by Corollary 2.8, that
the H-conjugacy class of the image of J via the arrow J → H that occurs in such
a factorization is uniquely determined.
(v) The property observed at v ∈ Varc in (iv) is somewhat weaker than the
rather strong property observed at v ∈ Vbad in (iii). In the present series of papers, however, we shall only be concerned with such subtle factorization properties at v ∈ Vbad , where we wish to develop, in [IUTchII], the theory of “Hodge-

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY I

111

Arakelov-theoretic evaluation” by restricting certain cohomology classes via an arrow “J → H” appearing in a factorization “J → H → G” of the sort discussed
in (i). In fact, in the context of the theory of Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic evaluation
that will be developed in [IUTchII], a slightly modiﬁed version of the phenomenon discussed in (iii) — which involves the “additive” version to be developed in
§6 of the “multiplicative” theory developed in the present §4 — will be of central
importance.

Proposition 4.2. Assertions (ii) and (iii) follow immediately from the intrinsic
nature of the constructions of Example 4.5. 
Remark 4.7.1. The signiﬁcance of the natural bijection † ζ of Proposition 4.7,

global data † D in a fashion that is independent of the local data [i.e., “prime-strip
data”] † D> , † DJ [cf. Remark 4.3.2, (b)]. Then
by replacing the capsule index set J by the set of global label classes of
cusps LabCusp(† D ) via † ζ , one obtains an object — i.e., LabCusp(† D )
— constructed via [i.e., “native to”] the global data that is immune to the

“collapsing” of J → F


That is to say, this “collapsing” of [i.e., failure of F
l to act freely on] Fl -orbits
of V±un is a characteristically global consequence of the global prime decomposition
trees discussed in Remark 4.3.1, (ii) [cf. the example discussed in Remark 4.2.1]. We
refer to Remark 4.9.3, (ii), below for a discussion of a closely related phenomenon.

Remark 4.7.2.
(i) At the level of labels [cf. the content of Proposition 4.7], the structure of a
D-ΘNF-Hodge theater may be summarized via the diagram of Fig. 4.4 below — i.e.,
where the expression “[ 1 < 2 < . . . < (l − 1) < l ]” corresponds to † D> ; the
expression “( 1 2 . . .
l − 1 l )” corresponds to † DJ ; the lower right
hand “Fl -cycle of ’s” corresponds to † D ; the “⇑” corresponds to the associated
D-Θ-bridge; the “⇒” corresponds to the associated D-NF-bridge; the “/ ’s” denote
D-prime-strips.
(ii) Note that the labels arising from † D> correspond, ultimately, to various
irreducible components in the special ﬁber of a certain tempered covering of a
[“geometric”!] Tate curve [a special ﬁber which consists of a chain of copies
of the projective line — cf. [EtTh], Corollary 2.9]. In particular, these labels are
obtained by counting — in an intuitive, archimedean, additive fashion — the number
of irreducible components between a given irreducible component and the “origin”.
That is to say, the portion of the diagram of Fig. 4.4 corresponding to † D> may
be described by the following terms:
geometric, additive, archimedean, hence Frobenius-like [cf. Corollary 3.8].

114

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

By contrast, the various “’s” in the portion of the diagram of Fig. 4.4 corresponding to † D arise, ultimately, from various primes of an [“arithmetic”!] number
×
ﬁeld. These primes are permuted by the multiplicative group F
l = Fl /{±1}, in a
cyclic — i.e., nonarchimedean — fashion. Thus, the portion of the diagram of Fig.
4.4 corresponding to † D may be described by the following terms:
arithmetic, multiplicative, nonarchimedean, hence étale-like [cf.
the discussion of Remark 4.3.2].
That is to say, the portions of the diagram of Fig. 4.4 corresponding to † D> , † D
diﬀer quite fundamentally in structure. In particular, it is not surprising that the
only “common ground” of these two fundamentally structurally diﬀerent portions
consists of an underlying set of cardinality l [i.e., the portion of the diagram of
Fig. 4.4 corresponding to † DJ ].
(iii) The bijection † ζ — or, perhaps more appropriately, its inverse
∼

(† ζ )−1 : J → LabCusp(† D )
— may be thought of as relating arithmetic [i.e., if one thinks of the elements of
the capsule index set J as collections of primes of a number ﬁeld] to geometry [i.e.,
if one thinks of the elements of LabCusp(† D ) as corresponding to the [geometric!]
cusps of the hyperbolic orbicurve]. From this point of view,
(† ζ )−1 may be thought of as a sort of “combinatorial Kodaira-Spencer
morphism” [cf. the point of view of [HASurI], §1.4].
We refer to Remark 4.9.2, (iv), below, for another way to think about † ζ .

Fig. 4.4: The combinatorial structure of a D-ΘNF-Hodge theater
The following result follows immediately from the deﬁnitions.

Proposition 4.8. (First Properties of Base-NF-Bridges, Base-Θ-Bridges,
and Base-ΘNF-Hodge Theaters) Relative to a ﬁxed collection of initial Θdata:
(i) The set of isomorphisms between two D-NF-bridges forms an F
l torsor.
(ii) The set of isomorphisms between two D-Θ-bridges (respectively, two
D-ΘNF-Hodge theaters) is of cardinality one.
(iii) Given a D-NF-bridge and a D-Θ-bridge, the set of capsule-full polyisomorphisms between the respective capsules of D-prime-strips which allow one to
glue the given D-NF- and D-Θ-bridges together to form a D-ΘNF-Hodge theater
forms an F
l -torsor.
(iv) Given a D-NF-bridge, there exists a [relatively simple — cf. the discussion
of Examples 4.4, (i), (ii), (iii); 4.5, (i), (ii)] functorial algorithm for constructing, up to an F
l -indeterminacy [cf. (i), (iii)], from the given D-NF-bridge a
D-ΘNF-Hodge theater whose underlying D-NF-bridge is the given D-NF-bridge.

whose output data admits an Sl -symmetry [where we write Sl for the symmetric group on l letters] which acts transitively on the index set [i.e., “J”] of this
output data. Thus, this functor may be thought of as an operation that consists of

forgetting the labels ∈ F

4.7, (i)]. In particular, if one is only given this output data † DJ up to isomorphism,
then there is a total of precisely l possibilities for the element ∈ F
l to which a
given index j ∈ J corresponds [cf. Proposition 4.7, (i)], prior to the application of
this functor.
(iii) (Mono-analytic Capsules) By composing the functor of (ii) with the

whose output data satisﬁes the same symmetry properties with respect to labels as
the output data of the functor of (ii).
Proof. Assertions (i), (ii), (iii) follow immediately from the deﬁnitions [cf. also
Proposition 4.8, (i), in the case of assertion (i)]. 
Remark 4.9.1.
(i) Ultimately, in the theory of the present series of papers [cf., especially,
[IUTchII], §2], we shall be interested in
evaluating the étale theta function of [EtTh] — i.e., in the spirit of
the Hodge-Arakelov theory of [HASurI], [HASurII] — at the various
D-prime-strips of † DJ , in the fashion stipulated by the labels discussed
in Proposition 4.7, (i).
These values of the étale theta function will be used to construct various arithmetic
line bundles. We shall be interested in computing the arithmetic degrees — in
the form of various “log-volumes” — of these arithmetic line bundles. In order to
compute these global log-volumes, it is necessary to be able to compare the logvolumes that arise at D-prime-strips with diﬀerent labels. It is for this reason that
the non-labeled output data of the functors of Proposition 4.9, (i), (ii), (iii) [cf. also
Proposition 4.11, (i), (ii), below], are of crucial importance in the theory of the
present series of papers. That is to say,
the non-labeled output data of the functors of Proposition 4.9, (i), (ii),
(iii) [cf. also Proposition 4.11, (i), (ii), below] — which allow one to
consider isomorphisms between the D-prime-strips that were originally

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY I

117

assigned diﬀerent labels — make possible the comparison of objects
[e.g., log-volumes] constructed relative to diﬀerent labels.
In Proposition 4.11, (i), (ii), below, we shall see that by considering “processions”,
one may perform such comparisons in a fashion that minimizes the label indeterminacy that arises.
(ii) Since the F
l -symmetry that appears in Proposition 4.9, (i), is transitive,
it follows that one may use this action to perform comparisons as discussed in (i).
This prompts the question:
What is the diﬀerence between this F
l -symmetry and the Sl -symmetry
of the output data of the functors of Proposition 4.9, (ii), (iii)?
In a word, restricting to the F
l -symmetry of Proposition 4.9, (i), amounts to the
imposition of a “cyclic structure” on the index set J [i.e., a structure of F
l -torsor

on J]. Thus, relative to the issue of comparability raised in (i), this Fl -symmetry
allows comparison between — i.e., involves isomorphisms between the non-labeled
D-prime-strips corresponding to — distinct members of this index set J, without
disturbing the cyclic structure on J. This cyclic structure may be thought of as
a sort of combinatorial manifestation of the link to the global object † D that
appears in a D-NF-bridge. On the other hand,
in order to compare these D-prime-strips indexed by J “in the absolute” to D-prime-strips that have nothing to do with J, it is necessary to
“forget the cyclic structure on J”.
This is precisely what is achieved by considering the functors of Proposition 4.9,
(ii), (iii), i.e., by working with the “full Sl -symmetry”.
Remark 4.9.2.
(i) The various elements of the index set of the capsule of D-prime-strips of a
D-NF-bridge are synchronized in their correspondence with the labels “1, 2, . . . , l ”,
in the sense that this correspondence is completely determined up to composition
with the action of an element of F
l . In particular, this correspondence is always
bijective.
One may regard this phenomenon of synchronization, or cohesion, as
an important consequence of the fact that the number ﬁeld in question is
represented in the D-NF-bridge via a single copy [i.e., as opposed to a
capsule whose index set is of cardinality ≥ 2] of D .
Indeed, consider a situation in which each D-prime-strip in the capsule † DJ is
equipped with its own “independent globalization”, i.e., copy of D , to which it
is related by a copy of “φNF
j ”, which [in order not to invalidate the comparability
of distinct labels — cf. Remark 4.9.1, (i)] is regarded as being known only up to
composition with the action of an element of F
l . Then if one thinks of the [manifestly mutually disjoint — cf. Deﬁnition 3.1, (f); Example 4.3, (i)] F
l -translates of
±un 
Bor 
bad
bad
V(K)
V(K) ] as being labeled by the
[whose union is equal to V
V

elements of Fl , then each D-prime-strip in the capsule † DJ — i.e., each “•” in Fig.
4.5 below — is subject, as depicted in Fig. 4.5, to an independent indeterminacy

118

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

concerning the label ∈ F
l to which it is associated. In particular, the set of all
possibilities for each association includes correspondences between the index set J
of the capsule † DJ and the set of labels F
l which fail to be bijective. Moreover,

although Fl arises essentially as a subquotient of a Galois group of extensions of
number ﬁelds [cf. the faithful poly-action of F
l on primes of V(K)], the fact that
it also acts faithfully on conjugates of the cusp  [cf. Example 4.3, (i)] implies that
“working with elements of V(K) up to F
l -indeterminacy” may only be done at the
expense of “working with conjugates of the cusp  up to F
l -indeterminacy”. That is
to say, “working with nonsynchronized labels” is inconsistent with the construction
of the crucial bijection † ζ in Proposition 4.7, (iii).

Fig. 4.5: Nonsynchronized labels
(ii) In the context of the discussion of (i), we observe that the “single copy” of
D may also be thought of as a “single connected component”, hence — from
the point of view of Galois categories — as a “single basepoint”.


(iii) In the context of the discussion of (i), it is interesting to note that since

the natural action of F
l on Fl is transitive, one obtains the same “set of all
possibilities for each association”, regardless of whether one considers independent
F
l -indeterminacies at each index of J or independent Sl -indeterminacies at each
index of J [cf. the discussion of Remark 4.9.1, (ii)].
(iv) The synchronized indeterminacy [cf. (i)] exhibited by a D-NF-bridge
— i.e., at a more concrete level, the crucial bijection † ζ of Proposition 4.7, (iii) —
may be thought of as a sort of combinatorial model of the notion of a “holomorphic structure”. By contrast, the nonsynchronized indeterminacies discussed in (i) may be thought of as a sort of combinatorial model of the notion of
a “real analytic structure”. Moreover, we observe that the theme of the above
discussion — in which one considers
“how a given combinatorial holomorphic structure is ‘embedded’ within
its underlying combinatorial real analytic structure”
— is very much in line with the spirit of classical complex Teichmüller theory.
(v) From the point of view discussed in (iv), the main results of the “multiplicative combinatorial Teichmüller theory” developed in the present §4 may
be summarized as follows:
(a) globalizability of labels, in a fashion that is independent of local structures
[cf. Remark 4.3.2, (b); Proposition 4.7, (iii)];
(b) comparability of distinct labels [cf. Proposition 4.9; Remark 4.9.1, (i)];
(c) absolute comparability [cf. Proposition 4.9, (ii), (iii); Remark 4.9.1, (ii)];

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY I

119

(d) minimization of label indeterminacy — without sacriﬁcing the symmetry
necessary to perform comparisons! — via processions [cf. Proposition
4.11, (i), (ii), below].

Remark 4.9.3.
(i) Ultimately, in the theory of the present series of papers [cf. [IUTchIII]],
we would like to apply the mono-anabelian theory of [AbsTopIII] to the various
local and global arithmetic fundamental groups [i.e., isomorphs of ΠC K , Πv for
v ∈ Vnon ] that appear in a D-ΘNF-Hodge theater [cf. the discussion of Remark
4.3.2]. To do this, it is of essential importance to have available not only the
absolute Galois groups of the various local and global base ﬁelds involved, but
also the geometric fundamental groups that lie inside the isomorphs of ΠC K , Πv
involved. Indeed, in the theory of [AbsTopIII], it is precisely the outer Galois action
of the absolute Galois group of the base ﬁeld on the geometric fundamental group
that allows one to reconstruct the ring structures group-theoretically in a fashion
that is compatible with localization/globalization operations as shown in Fig. 4.3.
Here, we pause to recall that in [AbsTopIII], Remark 5.10.3, (i), one may ﬁnd a
discussion of the analogy between this phenomenon of “entrusting of arithmetic
moduli” [to the outer Galois action on the geometric fundamental group] and the
Kodaira-Spencer isomorphism of an indigenous bundle — an analogy that
is reminiscent of the discussion of Remark 4.7.2, (iii).
(ii) Next, let us observe that the state of aﬀairs discussed in (i) has important
implications concerning the circumstances that necessitate the use of “−
X
→v ” [i.e., as
opposed to “C v ”] in the deﬁnition of “Dv ” in Examples 3.3, 3.4 [cf. Remark 4.2.1].
Indeed, localization/globalization operations as shown in Fig. 4.3 give rise, when
applied to the various geometric fundamental groups involved, to various bijections
between local and global sets of label classes of cusps. Now suppose that one uses
X
“C v ” instead of “−
→v ” in the deﬁnition of “Dv ” in Examples 3.3, 3.4. Then the
existence of v ∈ V of the sort discussed in Remark 4.2.1, together with the condition
of compatibility with localization/globalization operations as shown in Fig. 4.3 —
where we take, for instance,
(v of Fig. 4.3)

def

(v  of Fig. 4.3)

def

=

=

(v of Remark 4.2.1)
(w of Remark 4.2.1)

— imply that, at a combinatorial level, one is led, in eﬀect, to a situation of the
sort discussed in Remark 4.9.2, (i), i.e., a situation involving nonsynchronized
labels [cf. Fig. 4.5], which, as discussed in Remark 4.9.2, (i), is incompatible with
the construction of the crucial bijection † ζ of Proposition 4.7, (iii), an object which
will play an important role in the theory of the present series of papers.
Deﬁnition 4.10. Let C be a category, n a positive integer. Then we shall refer
to as a procession of length n, or n-procession, of C any diagram of the form
P1 → P2 → . . . → Pn

Section 5: ΘNF-Hodge Theaters
In the present §5, we continue our discussion of various “enhancements” to the
Θ-Hodge theaters of §3. Namely, we deﬁne the notion of a ΘNF-Hodge theater
[cf. Deﬁnition 5.5, (iii)] and observe that these ΘNF-Hodge theaters satisfy the
same “functorial dynamics” [cf. Corollary 5.6; Remark 5.6.1] as the base-ΘNFHodge theaters discussed in §4.

be a D-ΘNF-Hodge theater [cf. Deﬁnition 4.6], relative to a ﬁxed collection of initial

mod , ) as in Deﬁnition 3.1.
Example 5.1.

Global Frobenioids.

(i) By applying the anabelian result of [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9, via the
“Θ-approach” discussed in Remark 3.1.2, to π1 († D ), we may construct group×
theoretically from π1 († D ) an isomorph of “F ” — which we shall denote
M ( † D  )
— equipped with its natural π1 († D )-action. Here, we recall that this construction



includes a reconstruction of the ﬁeld structure on M († D ) = M († D )
Next, let us recall [cf. Remark 3.1.7, (i)] the unique model CFmod of the F -core CF
over Fmod . Observe that one may construct group-theoretically from π1 († D ), in a
functorial fashion, a proﬁnite group corresponding to “CFmod ” [cf. the algorithms of
[AbsTopII], Corollary 3.3, (i), which are applicable in light of [AbsTopI], Example
4.8], which contains π1 († D ) as an open subgroup; write † D for B(−)0 of this
proﬁnite group, so we obtain a natural morphism
†

D → † D

— i.e., a “category-theoretic version” of the natural morphism of hyperbolic orbicurves C K → CFmod — together with a natural extension of the action of π1 († D )
on M († D ) to π1 († D ). In particular, by taking π1 († D )-invariants, we obtain

of the pseudo-monoids of κ-, ∞ κ-, and ∞ κ×-coric rational functions associated to
CFmod [cf. the discussion of Remark 3.1.7, (i), (ii); [AbsTopII], Corollary 3.3, (iii),

We shall refer to this phenomenon [cf. also Remark 5.1.5 below] as the phenomenon
of κ-sol-conjugate synchronization.
(ii) Next, let us recall [cf. Deﬁnition 4.1, (v)] that the ﬁeld structure on
M ( D ) [i.e., “F ”] allows one to reconstruct group-theoretically from π1 († D )

the set of valuations V(† D ) [i.e., “V(F )”] on M († D ) equipped with its natural
π1 († D )-action, hence also the monoid on † D [i.e., in the sense of [FrdI], Deﬁnition
1.1, (ii)]
Φ († D )(−)

that associates to an object A ∈ Ob(† D ) the monoid Φ († D )(A) of “stacktheoretic” [cf. Remark 3.1.5] arithmetic divisors on the corresponding subﬁeld


M († D )A ⊆ M († D ) [i.e., the monoid denoted “Φ(−)” in [FrdI], Example 6.3;
cf. also Remark 3.1.5 of the present paper], together with the natural morphism
of monoids M († D )A → Φ († D )(A)gp [cf. the discussion of [FrdI], Example
6.3; Remark 3.1.5 of the present paper]. As discussed in [FrdI], Example 6.3 [cf.
also Remark 3.1.5 of the present paper], this data determines, by applying [FrdI],
Theorem 5.2, (ii), a model Frobenioid
F  († D  )
over the base category † D .
(iii) Let † F  be any category equivalent to F  († D ). Thus, † F  is equipped
with a natural Frobenioid structure [cf. [FrdI], Corollary 4.11; [FrdI], Theorem 6.4,
(i); Remark 3.1.5 of the present paper]; write Base(† F  ) for the base category of
this Frobenioid. Suppose further that we have been given a morphism
†

D → Base(† F  )

which is abstractly equivalent [cf. §0] to the natural morphism † D → † D [cf. (i)].
In the following discussion, we shall use the resulting [uniquely determined, in light
of the F -coricity of CF , together with [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9!] isomorphism
∼
Base(† F  ) → † D to identify Base(† F  ) with † D . Let us denote by

the restriction of † F  to the full subcategory of † D determined by the terminal

arises [in the evident sense] from data as discussed in Deﬁnition 3.1, the Frobenioid
† 
Fmod may be thought of as the Frobenioid of arithmetic line bundles on the stack
“Smod ” of Remark 3.1.5.
(iv) We continue to use the notation of (iii). We shall denote by a superscript
“birat” the birationalizations [which are category-theoretic — cf. [FrdI], Corollary
4.10; [FrdI], Theorem 6.4, (i); Remark 3.1.5 of the present paper] of the Frobe
; we shall also use this superscript to denote the images
nioids † F  , † F  , † Fmod
of objects and morphisms of these Frobenioids in their birationalizations. Thus, if
A ∈ Ob(† F  ), then O× (Abirat ) may be naturally identiﬁed with the multiplicative
group of nonzero elements of the number ﬁeld [i.e., ﬁnite extension of Fmod ] corresponding to A. In particular, by allowing A to vary among the Frobenius-trivial
objects [a notion which is category-theoretic — cf. [FrdI], Deﬁnition 1.2, (iv); [FrdI],
Corollary 4.11, (iv); [FrdI], Theorem 6.4, (i); Remark 3.1.5 of the present paper]
of † F  that lie over Galois objects of † D , we obtain a pair [i.e., consisting of a
topological group acting continuously on a discrete abelian group]
π1 ( † D  )



×
O

— which we consider up to the action by the “inner automorphisms of the pair”
arising from conjugation by π1 († D ). Write Φ† F  for the divisor monoid of the
Frobenioid † F  [which is category-theoretic — cf. [FrdI], Corollary 4.11, (iii);
[FrdI], Theorem 6.4, (i); Remark 3.1.5 of the present paper]. Thus, for each
p ∈ Prime(Φ† F  (A)) [where we use the notation “Prime(−)” as in [FrdI], §0],
the natural homomorphism O× (Abirat ) → Φ† F  (A)gp [cf. [FrdI], Proposition 4.4,
(iii)] determines — i.e., by taking the inverse image via this homomorphism of
[the union with {0} of] the subset of Φ† F  (A) constituted by p — a submonoid
Op ⊆ O× (Abirat ). That is to say, in more intuitive terms, this submonoid is the
submonoid of integral elements of O× (Abirat ) with respect to the valuation determined by p of the number ﬁeld corresponding to A. Write Op× ⊆ Op for the
submonoid of invertible elements. Thus, by allowing A to vary among the Frobeniustrivial objects of † F  that lie over Galois objects of † D and considering the way
in which the natural action of Aut† F  (A) on O× (Abirat ) permutes the various submonoids Op , it follows that for each p0 ∈ Prime(Φ† F  (A0 )), where A0 ∈ Ob(† F  )
lies over a terminal object of † D , we obtain a closed subgroup [well-deﬁned up to
conjugation]
Πp0 ⊆ π1 († D )
by considering the elements of Aut† F  (A) that ﬁx the submonoid Op , for some
system of p’s lying over p0 . That is to say, in more intuitive terms, the subgroup
Πp0 is simply the decomposition group associated to some v ∈ Vmod . In particular,
it follows that p0 is nonarchimedean if and only if the p-cohomological dimension
of Πp0 is equal to 2 + 1 = 3 for inﬁnitely many prime numbers p [cf., e.g., [NSW],
Theorem 7.1.8, (i)].

of the decomposition group of some strictly critical point of CFmod
is a torsion element [i.e., corresponds to a root of unity],
and, moreover, that
the operation of restricting Kummer classes [as in the above discus† 
sion] arising from † M
M∞ κ to subgroups of π1κ-sol († D ) that corκ ⊆
respond to decomposition groups of non-critical Fmod -, Fsol -valued

A similar statement to the statement of the last display holds, if one makes the

“Fmod -, Fsol -”  “F -”;

in the notation of the discussion of (iv), suppose that p is nonarchimedean [i.e., lies
over a nonarchimedean p0 ]. Thus, p determines a valuation, hence, in particular, a
topology on the ring {0} ∪ O× (Abirat ). Write O× , O for the respective completions,

p. Thus, again by allowing A to vary and considering the resulting system of indtopological monoids “O ”, we obtain a construction, for nonarchimedean p0 , of the

Remark 5.1.1. Thus, † FJ

to “constant distributions” on VJ . Such constant distributions are depicted in Fig.
5.1 above. On the other hand, the product of [underlying categories of] Frobenioids
† 
FJ may be thought of as a sort of category of “arbitrary distributions” on VJ ,
i.e., divisors on VJ whose dependence on j ∈ J is arbitrary.

Remark 5.1.2. The constructions of Example 5.1 manifestly only require the

 of the D-ΘNF-Hodge theater HT
Remark 5.1.3. In the context of the discussion of Example 5.1, (v), (vi), we note
† 
† 
† 
that unlike the case with † F  , † F  , † M , † M
sol , M∞ κ , M∞ κ× , or Mκ-sol , one

cannot perform Kummer theory [cf. [FrdII], Deﬁnition 2.1, (ii)] with † Fmod

×
×
† 
or Mκ . [That is to say, in more concrete terms, [unlike the case with F , Fsol
,
or ∞ κ-/∞ κ×-coric rational functions] it is not necessarily the case that elements of
×
Fmod
or κ-coric rational functions admit N -th roots, for N a nonnegative integer!]
The fact that one can perform Kummer theory with † F  , † F  , or † M implies that
† 
M equipped with its natural π1 († D )-action, as well as the “birational monoid
portions” of † F  or † F  , satisfy various strong rigidity properties [cf. Corollary 5.3,
(i), below]. For instance, these rigidity properties allow one to recover the additive
structure on [the union with {0} of] † M equipped with its natural π1 († D )-action
[cf. the discussion of Example 5.1, (v), (vi)]. That is to say,
the additive structure — or, equivalently, ring/ﬁeld structure — on

may only
[the union with {0} of] the “birational monoid portion” of † Fmod

Put another way, if one only considers the category † Fmod

of copies of] † Fmod
— i.e., † Fj , † FJ

are also Kummer-blind.

Remark 5.1.4. The various functorial reconstruction algorithms for number
ﬁelds discussed in Example 5.1 are based on the technique of Belyi cuspidalization, as applied in the theory of [AbsTopIII], §1. At a more concrete level, this
theory of [AbsTopIII], §1, may be thought of revolving around the point of view
that
elements of number ﬁelds may be expressed geometrically by means of
Belyi maps.
Moreover, if one thinks of such elements of number ﬁelds as “analytic functions”,
then the remainder of the theory of [AbsTopIII] [cf., especially, [AbsTopIII], §5]
may be thought of as a sort of theory of
“analytic continuation” of the “analytic functions” constituted by elements of number ﬁelds in the context of the various logarithm maps
at the various localizations of these number ﬁelds.
This point of view is very much in line with the points of view discussed in Remarks 4.3.2, 4.3.3. Moreover, the geometric representation of elements of number
ﬁelds via Belyi maps [i.e., whose existence may be regarded as a reﬂection of
the hyperbolic nature of the projective line minus three points] is reminiscent of —
indeed, may perhaps be regarded as an arithmetic analogue of — the “categories
of hyperbolic analytic continuations”, i.e., of copies of the upper half-plane
regarded as equipped with their natural hyperbolic metrics, discussed in the
“Motivating Example” given in the Introduction to [GeoAnbd]. Here, it is perhaps
of interest to note that the inequalities “≤ 1” satisﬁed by the derivatives [i.e., with
respect to the respective Poincaré metrics] of the holomorphic maps that appear
in this “Motivating Example” in [GeoAnbd] are reminiscent of the monotonically
decreasing nature of the various “degrees” — i.e., over Q of the ramiﬁcation locus of
the endomorphisms of the projective line over Q — that appear in the construction
of Belyi maps [where we recall that this monotonic decreasing of degrees is the key
observation that allows one to obtain Belyi maps which are unramiﬁed over the
projective line minus three points].
Remark 5.1.5. Although the phenomenon of κ-sol-conjugate synchronization
discussed in the ﬁnal portion of Example 5.1, (i), will not play as central a role
in the present series of papers as the conjugate synchronization of local Galois
groups that will be discussed in [IUTchII], [IUTchIII], it has the following interesting
consequence:

— i.e., of the abstract analogues of “∞ κ-coric functions”, “Fmod

“Fsol ” as in Remark 3.1.7, (iii) — that was discussed in Example 5.1,
(v), may be performed in a fashion that is compatible without any
conjugacy indeterminacies with the poly-action of (AutSL († D ) )
F
l .

Here, we pause, however, to make the following observation: At ﬁrst glance, it may
appear as though the analogue obtained by Uchida of the Neukirch-Uchida theorem
for maximal solvable quotients of absolute Galois groups of number ﬁelds [reviewed,
for instance, in [GlSol], §3] — or, perhaps, some future mono-anabelian version
of this result of Uchida — may be applied, in the context of the “κ-sol-Kummer
theory” just discussed, to reconstruct the ring structure on the number ﬁelds
involved [i.e., in the fashion of Example 5.1, (v)]. In fact, however,
such a “solvable-Uchida-type” reconstruction is, in eﬀect, meaningless from the point of view of the theory of the present series of papers
since it is fundamentally incompatible with the localization operations that occur in the structure of a D-ΘNF-Hodge theater — cf. the
discussion of Remarks 4.3.1, 4.3.2.
Indeed, such a compatibility with localization would imply that the reconstruction
of the ring structure may somehow be “restricted” to the absolute Galois groups of
completions at nonarchimedean primes of a number ﬁeld, i.e., in contradiction to the
well-known fact that absolute Galois groups of such completions at nonarchimedean
primes admit automorphisms that do not arise from ﬁeld automorphisms [cf., e.g.,
[NSW], the Closing Remark preceding Theorem 12.2.7]. Finally, we note that this
incompatibility of “solvable-Uchida-type” reconstructions of ring structures with the
theory of the present series of papers is also interesting in the context of the point
of view discussed in Remark 5.1.4: Suppose, for instance, that it was the case that
the outer action of the absolute Galois group of a number ﬁeld on the geometric fundamental group of a hyperbolic curve over the number ﬁeld in fact factors through
the maximal solvable quotient of the absolute Galois group. Then it is conceivable
that some sort of version of the mono-anabelian theory of [AbsTopIII], §1, for extensions of such a maximal solvable quotient by the geometric fundamental group
under consideration could be applied in the theory of the present series of papers to
give a reconstruction of the ring structure of a number ﬁeld that only requires the
use of such extensions and is, moreover, compatible with the localization operations
that occur in the various types of “Hodge theaters” that appear in the theory of
the present series of papers — a state of aﬀairs that would be fundamentally at
odds with a quite essential portion of the “spirit” of the theory of the present
series of papers, namely, the point of view of “dismantling the two underlying
combinatorial dimensions of a ring”. In fact, however,
the outer action referred to above does not admit such a “solvable factorization”.
Indeed, the nonexistence of such a “solvable factorization” is a formal consequence
of the the Galois injectivity result discussed in [NodNon], Theorem C — a result
that depends, in an essential way, on the theory of Belyi maps. Put another way,

134

Belyi maps not only play the role of allowing one to perform the sort of
“arithmetic analytic continuation via Belyi cuspidalizations” [i.e.,
discussed in Remark 5.1.4] that is of central importance in the theory of
the present series of papers, but also play the role of assuring one that such
“arithmetic analytic continuations” cannot be extended to the case of
extensions associated to “solvable factorizations” of outer actions of
the sort just discussed.

Deﬁnition 5.2.
(i) We deﬁne a holomorphic Frobenioid-prime-strip, or F-prime-strip, [relative
to the given initial Θ-data] to be a collection of data
‡

F = {‡ Fv }v∈V

that satisﬁes the following conditions: (a) if v ∈ Vnon , then ‡ Fv is a category ‡ Cv

which admits an equivalence of categories ‡ Cv → Cv [where Cv is as in Examples
3.2, (iii); 3.3, (i)]; (b) if v ∈ Varc , then ‡ Fv = (‡ Cv , ‡ Dv , ‡ κv ) is a collection of data
consisting of a category, an Aut-holomorphic orbispace, and a Kummer structure

such that there exists an isomorphism of collections of data ‡ Fv → F v = (Cv , Dv , κv )
[where F v is as in Example 3.4, (i)].

(ii) We deﬁne a mono-analytic Frobenioid-prime-strip, or F  -prime-strip, [relative to the given initial Θ-data] to be a collection of data
‡ 

that satisﬁes the following conditions: (a) if v ∈ Vnon , then ‡ Fv is a split Frobenioid, whose underlying Frobenioid we denote by ‡ Cv , which admits an isomorphism
‡  ∼
Fv → Fv [where Fv is as in Examples 3.2, (v); 3.3, (i)]; (b) if v ∈ Varc , then
‡ 
Fv is a triple of data, consisting of a Frobenioid ‡ Cv , an object of TM , and a
splitting of the Frobenioid, such that there exists an isomorphism of collections of

data ‡ Fv → Fv [where Fv is as in Example 3.4, (ii)].
(iii) A morphism of F- (respectively, F  -) prime-strips is deﬁned to be a collection of isomorphisms, indexed by V, between the various constituent objects of
the prime-strips. Following the conventions of §0, one thus has notions of capsules of F- (respectively, F  -) and morphisms of capsules of F- (respectively, F  -)
prime-strips.

which are, in fact, isomorphic to R≥0 ]; (f) the collection of data in the above display
is isomorphic to the collection of data F

F -prime-strips is deﬁned to be an isomorphism between collections of data as
discussed above. Following the conventions of §0, one thus has notions of capsules
of F  -prime-strips and morphisms of capsules of F  -prime-strips.
(v) Let ‡ D = {‡ Dw }w∈V be a D-prime-strip, v ∈ Vnon . Write v ∈ Vmod for
the valuation determined by v. Then [cf. the discussion of Example 5.1, (i); Remark 3.1.7, (i)] one may construct group-theoretically from π1 (‡ Dv ), in a functorial
fashion, a proﬁnite group corresponding to “Cv ” [cf. the algorithms of [AbsTopII],
Corollary 3.3, (i), which are applicable in light of [AbsTopI], Example 4.8; [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9], which contains π1 (‡ Dv ) as an open subgroup; we write ‡ Dv
for B(−)0 of this proﬁnite group, so we obtain a natural morphism

Next, let us observe [cf. Remark 3.1.7, (i); the construction of the Belyi cuspidalizations of [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9, (a), and of the ﬁeld “KZ×NF ” of [AbsTopIII],
Theorem 1.9, (d), (e)] that one may construct group-theoretically from π1 (‡ Dv ), in
a functorial fashion, an isomorph

( π1 (‡ Dv ))

of the étale fundamental group [i.e., equipped with its natural surjection to π1 (‡ Dv )
and well-deﬁned up to inner automorphisms determined by elements of the kernel
of this natural surjection] of the scheme obtained by base-changing to (Fmod )v the
generic point of CFmod . Next, let us recall [cf. [AbsTopIII], Corollary 1.10, (b), (c),
(d), (d )] that one may construct group-theoretically from π1 (‡ Dv ), in a functorial
fashion, an ind-topological monoid [which is naturally isomorphic to OF ]
v

Mv (‡ Dv )
equipped with its natural π1 (‡ Dv )-action, as well as isomorphs of the pseudomonoids of κ-, ∞ κ-, and ∞ κ×-coric rational functions associated to Cv [cf. the
discussion of Remark 3.1.7, (i), (ii); [AbsTopII], Corollary 3.3, (iii), which is applicable in light of [AbsTopI], Example 4.8; [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9, (a), (d), (e);
[AbsTopIII], Corollary 1.10, (d), (d )] — which we shall denote
Mκv (‡ Dv ),

M∞ κv (‡ Dv ),

M∞ κ×v (‡ Dv )

— equipped with their natural π1rat (‡ Dv )-actions. Thus, Mκv (‡ Dv ) may be identiﬁed with the subset of π1rat (‡ Dv )-invariants of M∞ κv (‡ Dv ), and [if we use the

136

superscript “×” to denote the subset of invertible elements of a pseudo-monoid,
then] Mv (‡ Dv )× may be identiﬁed with M∞ κ×v (‡ Dv )× .
(vi) We continue to use the notation of (v). Suppose further that ‡ F =
{‡ Fw }w∈V is an F-prime-strip whose associated D-prime-strip [cf. Remark 5.2.1,
(i), below] is equal to ‡ D = {‡ Dw }w∈V . Let
π1 (‡ Dv )

‡

Mv

be an ind-topological monoid equipped with a continuous action by π1 (‡ Dv ) that
is isomorphic [i.e., as an ind-topological monoid equipped with a continuous action
by π1 (‡ Dv )] to the pair π1 (‡ Dv )  Mv (‡ Dv ) constructed in (v). One may regard
such a pair π1 (‡ Dv )  ‡ Mv as being related to the Frobenioid ‡ Fv [cf. (i), (a)]
via the unique isomorphism corresponding to the identity automorphism of ‡ D =
{‡ Dw }w∈V [cf. Corollary 5.3, (ii), below] between ‡ Fv and the pv -adic Frobenioid
determined [cf. Remark 3.3.2] by the pair
π1 ( ‡ D v )  ‡ M v
obtained by restricting the action of the pair π1 (‡ Dv )  ‡ Mv to the open subgroup
π1 (‡ Dv ) ⊆ π1 (‡ Dv ) [cf. (v)]. We shall refer to a pair [i.e., consisting of a pseudomonoid equipped with a continuous action by π1rat (‡ Dv )]
π1rat (‡ Dv )

‡

M∞ κv

(respectively, π1rat (‡ Dv )

as an ∞ κ-coric (respectively, ∞ κ×-coric) structure on ‡ Fv if it is isomorphic [i.e.,
as a pair consisting of a pseudo-monoid equipped with a continuous action by
π1rat (‡ Dv )] to the pair
π1rat (‡ Dv )



M∞ κv (‡ Dv )

(respectively, π1rat (‡ Dv )



M∞ κ×v (‡ Dv ))

of (v). Suppose that we have been given such an ∞ κ-coric (respectively, ∞ κ×-coric)
structure on ‡ Fv . In the following, we shall use the notational convention “μZ ((−))”
introduced in Example 5.1, (v). Also, let us write μΘ (π1 (‡ Dv )) for the cyclotome
Z
“μZ (Π(−) )” of [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9, which we think of as being applied “via the
Θ-approach” [cf. Remark 3.1.2] to π1 (‡ Dv ). Then let us observe that M∞ κv (‡ Dv )
(respectively, M∞ κ×v (‡ Dv )) is, in eﬀect, constructed [cf. [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9,
(d)] as a subset of

consideration of Kummer classes [i.e., of the action of π1rat (‡ Dv ) on N -th roots of

M∞ κ×v ) into

case of M∞ κv (‡ Dv ) (respectively, M∞ κ×v (‡ Dv )). In particular, it follows immediately [cf. the discussion of Example 5.1, (v)], by considering divisors of zeroes
and poles [cf. the deﬁnition of a “κ-coric function” given in Remark 3.1.7, (i)]
associated to Kummer classes of rational functions as in [AbsTopIII], Proposition
1.6, (iii), from the elementary observation that, relative to the natural inclusion

that there exists a unique isomorphism of cyclotomes

such that the resulting isomorphism between direct limits of cohomology modules
as considered above induces an isomorphism

M∞ κv (‡ Dv ) → ‡ M∞ κv

(respectively, M∞ κ×v (‡ Dv ) → ‡ M∞ κ×v )

[i.e., of pseudo-monoids equipped with continuous actions by π1rat (‡ Dv )]. In a similar
vein, it follows immediately from the theory summarized in [AbsTopIII], Corollary
1.10, (d), (d ), that there exists a unique isomorphism of cyclotomes
∼

μΘ (π1 (‡ Dv )) → μZ (‡ Mv )
Z

such that the resulting isomorphism between direct limits of cohomology modules
induces an isomorphism
∼
Mv (‡ Dv ) → ‡ Mv
[i.e., of monoids equipped with continuous actions by π1 (‡ Dv )]. In particular, it
follows immediately from the above discussion that
‡

Fv always admits an ∞ κ-coric (respectively, ∞ κ×-coric) structure, which
is, moreover, unique up to a uniquely determined isomorphism [i.e., of
pseudo-monoids equipped with continuous actions by π1rat (‡ Dv )].

Thus, in the following, we shall regard, without further notice, this uniquely determined ∞ κ-coric (respectively, ∞ κ×-coric) structure on ‡ Fv as a collection of data
that is naturally associated to ‡ Fv . Here, we observe that the various isomorphisms
of the last few displays allow one to regard the pseudo-monoids ‡ M∞ κv , ‡ M∞ κ×v
as being related to the Frobenioid ‡ Fv via ‡ Mv [cf. the discussion at the beginning of the present (vi) concerning the relationship between ‡ Mv and ‡ Fv ] and the

Mκv ⊆ ‡ M∞ κv

for the “sub-pseudo-monoid” of π1rat (‡ Dv )-invariants. In this context, we observe
further that it follows immediately from the discussion of Remark 3.1.7, (i), (ii) [cf.
also [AbsTopII], Corollary 3.3, (iii), which is applicable in light of [AbsTopI], Example 4.8], and the theory summarized in [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9 [cf., especially,
[AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9, (a), (d), (e)], and [AbsTopIII], Corollary 1.10, (h), that
any ∞ κ×-coric structure π1rat (‡ Dv ) 
an associated ∞ κ-coric structure

‡

M∞ κ×v on ‡ Fv determines

π1rat (‡ Dv )  ‡ M∞ κv ⊆ ‡ M∞ κ×v
by considering the subset of elements for which the restriction of the
associated Kummer class [as in the above discussion] to some [or, equivalently, every — cf. Remark 5.2.3 below] subgroup of π1rat (‡ Dv ) that corresponds to an open subgroup of the decomposition group of some
∼
strictly critical point of Cv determines a torsion element ∈ ‡ M×
v →
‡ ×
M∞ κ×v [i.e., corresponds to a root of unity],
and, moreover, that
the operation of restricting Kummer classes [as in the above discussion] arising from ‡ Mκv ⊆ ‡ M∞ κv to subgroups of π1rat (‡ Dv ) that correspond to decomposition groups of non-critical (Fmod )v -valued points
of Cv yields a functorial algorithm for reconstructing the submonoid
of π1 (‡ Dv )-invariants of ‡ Mgp
v [where the superscript “gp” denotes the
groupiﬁcation], together with the ind-topological ﬁeld structure on the
union of this monoid with {0}, from the ∞ κ-coric structure ‡ M∞ κv
associated to ‡ Fv .
A similar statement to the statement of the last display holds, if one replaces the
phrase “(Fmod )v -valued points” by the phrase “F v -valued points” and the phrase
‡
‡ gp
“submonoid of π1 (‡ Dv )-invariants of ‡ Mgp
v ” by the phrase “pair π1 ( Dv )  Mv ”.
(vii) Let ‡ D = {‡ Dw }w∈V be a D-prime-strip, v ∈ Varc . Write v ∈ Vmod for the
valuation determined by v. Then [cf. the discussion of Example 5.1, (i); Remark
3.1.7, (i)] one may construct algorithmically from the Aut-holomorphic space ‡ Dv , in
a functorial fashion, an Aut-holomorphic orbispace ‡ Dv corresponding to “Cv ” [cf.
the algorithms of [AbsTopIII], Corollary 2.7, (a)], together with a natural morphism

— i.e., obtained by considering whether an automorphism of ‡ Dv is holomorphic
or anti-holomorphic — from the group of automorphisms of the Aut-holomorphic
orbispace ‡ Dv onto the Galois group Gal(Kv /(Fmod )v ) . Write
‡

Dvrat → ‡ Dv

for the projective system of Aut-holomorphic orbispaces that arise as universal
covering spaces of “co-ﬁnite” open sub-orbispaces of ‡ Dv [i.e., open sub-orbispaces
determined by forming complements of ﬁnite sets of points of the underlying topological orbispace of ‡ Dv ] that contain every strictly critical point [cf. Remark 3.1.7,
(i)], as well as every point that is not an NF-point [cf. Remark 3.4.3, (ii)], of
‡
Dv . Thus, ‡ Dvrat is well-deﬁned up to the action of deck transformations over ‡ Dv
[cf. the countability of the set of NF-points of ‡ Dv ; the discussion of compatible
systems of basepoints at the end of Remark 2.5.3, (i)]. Next, let us recall the
complex archimedean topological ﬁeld A‡ Dv [cf. the discussion of Example 3.4, (i),
as well as Deﬁnition 3.6, (b); the discussion of (i) of the present Deﬁnition 5.2].
Write Aut(A‡ Dv ) for the group of automorphisms (∼
= Z/2Z) of the topological ﬁeld
A‡ Dv . Observe that it follows immediately from the construction of A‡ Dv in [AbsTopIII], Corollary 2.7, (e), that A‡ Dv is equipped with a natural Aut-holomorphic
structure [cf. [AbsTopIII], Deﬁnition 4.1, (i)], as well as with a tautological coholomorphicization [cf. [AbsTopIII], Deﬁnition 2.1, (iv); [AbsTopIII], Proposition
2.6, (a)] with ‡ Dv . Write
Mv (‡ Dv ) ⊆ A‡ Dv
for the topological submonoid consisting of nonzero elements of norm ≤ 1 [i.e.,
“OC ”]. Thus, A‡ Dv may be identiﬁed with the union with {0} of the groupiﬁcation
Mv (‡ Dv )gp . Moreover, the pseudo-monoids of κ-, ∞ κ-, and ∞ κ×-coric rational
functions associated to Cv [cf. the discussion of Remark 3.1.7, (i), (ii)] may be
represented, via algorithmic constructions [cf. [AbsTopIII], Corollary 2.7, (b)], as
pseudo-monoids of “meromorphic functions”
Mκv (‡ Dv ),

M∞ κv (‡ Dv ),

M∞ κ×v (‡ Dv )

— i.e., as sets of morphisms of Aut-holomorphic orbispaces from [some constituent
of the projective system] ‡ Dvrat to Mv (‡ Dv )gp that are compatible with the tautological co-holomorphicization just discussed and, moreover, satisfy conditions corresponding to the conditions of the ﬁnal display of Remark 3.1.7, (i). Here, Mκv (‡ Dv )
may be identiﬁed with the subset of elements of M∞ κv (‡ Dv ) that descend to some
co-ﬁnite open sub-orbispace of ‡ Dv and, moreover, are equivariant with respect to
the unique embedding Aut(‡ Dv ) → Aut(A‡ Dv ); [if we use the superscript “×” to denote the subset of invertible elements of a pseudo-monoid, then] Mv (‡ Dv )× may be
identiﬁed with M∞ κ×v (‡ Dv )× ; we observe that both Mv (‡ Dv )× and M∞ κ×v (‡ Dv )×
are isomorphic, as abstract topological monoids, to S1 [i.e., “OC× ”].
(viii) We continue to use the notation of (vii). Suppose further that ‡ F =
{‡ Fw }w∈V is an F-prime-strip whose associated D-prime-strip [cf. Remark 5.2.1,
(i), below] is equal to ‡ D = {‡ Dw }w∈V . Write

for the topological monoid [i.e., “O (‡ Cv )” — cf. the discussion of Example 3.4, (i);
Deﬁnition 3.6, (b)] that appears as the domain of the Kummer structure portion
of the data that constitutes ‡ Fv [cf. (i) of the present Deﬁnition 5.2]. Thus, the
Kummer structure portion of ‡ Fv may be regarded as an isomorphism of
topological monoids
∼
Mv (‡ Dv ) → ‡ Mv
[both of which are abstractly isomorphic to OC ]. In particular, the Kummer struc∼
ture determines an isomorphism of topological groups Mv (‡ Dv )gp → ‡ Mgp
v [both
×
of which are abstractly isomorphic to C ], hence also a natural action of Aut(A‡ Dv )
on ‡ Mgp
v . Next, let us observe that the pseudo-monoid of ∞ κ- (respectively, ∞ κ×-)
coric rational functions associated to Cv [cf. the discussion of Remark 3.1.7, (i),

cuspidal inertia groups may be interpreted as proﬁnite completions of subgroups of
the group of deck transformations

Dvrat → ‡ Dv . Here, we observe that the pseudo-monoids M∞ κv (‡ Dv ), ‡ M∞ κv

points of ‡ Dvrat → ‡ Dv [i.e., systems of points lying over some strictly
critical point of ‡ Dv ].
In this context, we observe further that it follows immediately from the discussion
of Remark 3.1.7, (ii) [cf. also [AbsTopIII], Corollary 2.7, (b)], that
the ∞ κ-coric structure

and, moreover, that
the operation of restricting elements of ‡ Mκv ⊆ ‡ M∞ κv to systems
of points of ‡ Dvrat that lie over Aut(‡ Dv )-invariant non-critical points
of ‡ Dv yields a functorial algorithm for reconstructing the submonoid
of Aut(‡ Dv )-invariants of ‡ Mgp

groupiﬁcation], together with the topological ﬁeld structure on the union
of this monoid with {0}, from the ∞ κ-coric structure ‡ M∞ κv associated
to ‡ Fv .
A similar statement to the statement of the last display holds if one replaces the
phrase “Aut(‡ Dv )-invariant” by the phrase “arbitrary” and the phrase “submonoid

Remark 5.2.1.
(i) Note that it follows immediately from Deﬁnitions 4.1, (i), (iii); 5.2, (i),
(ii); Examples 3.2, (vi), (c), (d); 3.3, (iii), (b), (c), that there exists a functorial
algorithm for constructing D- (respectively, D -) prime-strips from F- (respectively,
F  -) prime-strips.
(ii) In a similar vein, it follows immediately from Deﬁnition 5.2, (i), (ii); Examples 3.2, (vi), (f); 3.3, (iii), (e); 3.4, (i), (ii), that there exists a functorial algorithm
for constructing from an F-prime-strip ‡ F = {‡ Fv }v∈V an F  -prime-strip ‡ F
‡

F → ‡ F = {‡ Fv }v∈V

— which we shall refer to as the mono-analyticization of ‡ F. Next, let us recall from
the discussion of Example 3.5, (i), the relatively simple structure of the category

”, i.e., which may be summarized, roughly speaking, as a collection, indexed
“Cmod
∼
by V → Vmod , of copies of the topological monoid R≥0 , which are related to one
another by a “product formula”. In particular, it follows immediately [cf. Deﬁnition
5.2, (i)] from the rigidity of the divisor monoids associated to the Frobenioids that
appear at each of the components at v ∈ V of an F-prime-strip [cf., especially,
the topological ﬁeld structure of the ﬁeld “ADv ” of Example 3.4, (i)!] that one
may also construct from the F-prime-strip ‡ F, via a functorial algorithm [cf. the
constructions of Example 3.5, (i), (ii)], a collection of data
‡

def

∼

F → ‡ F = (‡ C  , Prime(‡ C  ) → V, ‡ F , {‡ ρv }v∈V )

— i.e., consisting of a category [which is, in fact, equipped with a Frobenioid
structure], a bijection, the F  -prime-strip ‡ F , and an isomorphism of topological
monoids associated to ‡ C  and ‡ F , respectively, at each v ∈ V — which is isomorphic to the collection of data F
mod of Example 3.5, (ii), i.e., which forms an

F -prime-strip [cf. Deﬁnition 5.2, (iv)].
Remark 5.2.2. Thus, from the point of view of the discussion of Remark 5.1.3,
F-prime-strips are Kummer-ready [i.e., at v ∈ Vnon — cf. the theory of [FrdII], §2],
whereas F  -prime-strips are Kummer-blind.
Remark 5.2.3. In the context of the construction of ∞ κ-coric structures from
∞ κ×-coric structures in Deﬁnition 5.2, (vi), we make the following observation.
When v ∈ Vbad , it is natural to take the decomposition groups corresponding to
strictly critical points [i.e., to which one restricts the Kummer classes under consideration] to be decomposition groups that correspond to the point of Cv that
arises as the image of the zero-labeled evaluation points [i.e., evaluation points
corresponding to the label 0 ∈ |Fl | — cf. the discussion of Example 4.4, (i)]. In the
notation of Example 4.4, (i), this point of Cv may also be described simply as the
point that arises as the image of the point “μ− ”.

Θ-data:

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

(i) For i = 1, 2, let i F  (respectively, i F  ) be a category which is equivalent to the category † F  (respectively, † F  ) of Example 5.1, (iii). Thus, i F 
(respectively, i F  ) is equipped with a natural Frobenioid structure [cf. [FrdI],
Corollary 4.11; [FrdI], Theorem 6.4, (i); Remark 3.1.5 of the present paper]. Write
Base(i F  ) (respectively, Base(i F  )) for the base category of this Frobenioid. Then
the natural map
Isom(1 F  , 2 F  ) → Isom(Base(1 F  ), Base(2 F  ))
(respectively, Isom(1 F  , 2 F  ) → Isom(Base(1 F  ), Base(2 F  )))
[cf. [FrdI], Corollary 4.11; [FrdI], Theorem 6.4, (i); Remark 3.1.5 of the present
paper] is bijective.
(ii) For i = 1, 2, let i F be an F-prime-strip; i D the D-prime-strip associated
to i F [cf. Remark 5.2.1, (i)]. Then the natural map
Isom(1 F, 2 F) → Isom(1 D, 2 D)
[cf. Remark 5.2.1, (i)] is bijective.
(iii) For i = 1, 2, let i F be an F  -prime-strip; i D the D -prime-strip
associated to i F [cf. Remark 5.2.1, (i)]. Then the natural map
Isom(1 F , 2 F ) → Isom(1 D , 2 D )
[cf. Remark 5.2.1, (i)] is surjective.
(iv) Let v ∈ Vbad . Recall the category F v of Example 3.2, (i). Thus, F v
is equipped with a natural Frobenioid structure [cf. [FrdI], Corollary 4.11;
[EtTh], Proposition 5.1], with base category Dv . Then the natural homomorphism
Aut(F v ) → Aut(Dv ) [cf. Example 3.2, (vi), (d)] is bijective.
Proof. Assertion (i) follows immediately from the category-theoreticity of the “iso∼
morphism M († D ) → † M ” of Example 5.1, (v) [cf. also the surrounding
discussion; Example 5.1, (vi)]. [Here, we note in passing that this argument is en∼

tirely similar to the technique applied to the proof of the equivalence “Th
T → EA ”
of [AbsTopIII], Corollary 5.2, (iv).] Assertion (ii) (respectively, (iii)) follows immediately from [AbsTopIII], Proposition 3.2, (iv); [AbsTopIII], Proposition 4.2, (i) [cf.
also [AbsTopIII], Remarks 3.1.1, 4.1.1; the discussion of Deﬁnition 5.2, (vi), (viii),
of the present paper] (respectively, [AbsTopIII], Proposition 5.8, (ii), (v)).
Finally, we consider assertion (iv). First, we recall that since automorphisms
of Dv = B temp (X v )0 necessarily arise from automorphisms of the scheme X v [cf.
[AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9; [AbsTopIII], Remark 1.9.1], surjectivity follows immediately from the construction of F v . Thus, it remains to verify injectivity. To this

end, let α ∈ Ker(Aut(F v ) → Aut(Dv )). For simplicity, we suppose [without loss of
generality] that α lies over the identity self-equivalence of Dv . Then I claim that
to show that α is [isomorphic to — cf. §0] the identity self-equivalence of F v , it
suﬃces to verify that
α induces [cf. [FrdI], Corollary 4.11; [EtTh], Proposition 5.1] the identity
on the rational function and divisor monoids of F v .

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY I

145

Indeed, recall that since F v is a Frobenioid of model type [cf. [EtTh], Deﬁnition 3.6,
(ii)], it follows from [FrdI], Corollary 5.7, (i), (iv), that α preserves base-Frobenius
pairs. Thus, once one shows that α induces the identity on the rational function
and divisor monoids of F v , it follows, by arguing as in the construction of the
equivalence of categories given in the proof of [FrdI], Theorem 5.2, (iv), that the
various units obtained in [FrdI], Proposition 5.6, determine [cf. Remark 5.3.3 below;
the argument of the ﬁrst paragraph of the proof of [FrdI], Proposition 5.6] an
isomorphism between α and the identity self-equivalence of F v , as desired.
Thus, we proceed to show that α induces the identity on the rational function and divisor monoids of F v , as follows. In light of the category-theoreticity [cf.
[EtTh], Theorem 5.6] of the cyclotomic rigidity isomorphism of [EtTh], Proposition
5.5, the fact that α induces the identity on the rational function monoid follows
immediately from the naturality of the Kummer map [cf. the discussion of Remark
3.2.4; [FrdII], Deﬁnition 2.1, (ii)], which is injective by [EtTh], Proposition 3.2,
(iii) — cf. the argument of [EtTh], Theorem 5.7, applied to verify the categorytheoreticity of the Frobenioid-theoretic theta function. Next, we consider the eﬀect
of α on the divisor monoid of F v . To this end, let us ﬁrst recall that α preserves cuspidal and non-cuspidal elements of the monoids that appear in this divisor monoid
[cf. Remark 3.2.4, (vi); [EtTh], Proposition 5.3, (i)]. In particular, by considering
the non-cuspidal portion of the divisor of the Frobenioid-theoretic theta function
and its conjugates [each of which is preserved by α, since α has already been shown
to induce the identity on the rational function monoid of F v ], we conclude that α
induces the identity on the non-cuspidal elements of the monoids that appear in
the divisor monoid of F v [cf. [EtTh], Proposition 5.3, (v), (vi), for a discussion
of closely related facts]. In a similar vein, since any divisor of degree zero on an
elliptic curve that is supported on the torsion points of the elliptic curve admits a
positive multiple which is principal, it follows by considering the cuspidal portions
of divisors of appropriate rational functions [each of which is preserved by α, since
α has already been shown to induce the identity on the rational function monoid of
F v ] that α also induces the identity on the cuspidal elements of the monoids that
appear in the divisor monoid of F v . This completes the proof of assertion (iv). 
Remark 5.3.1.
(i) In the situation of Corollary 5.3, (ii), let
φ : 1D → 2D
be a morphism of D-prime-strips [i.e., which is not necessarily an isomorphism!]
that induces an isomorphism between the respective collections of data indexed by
∼
v ∈ Vgood , as well as an isomorphism φ : 1 D → 2 D between the associated
D -prime-strips [cf. Deﬁnition 4.1, (iv)]. Then let us observe that by applying
Corollary 5.3, (ii), it follows that φ lifts to a uniquely determined “arrow”
ψ : 1F → 2F
— which we think of as “lying over” φ — deﬁned as follows: First, let us recall
that, in light of our assumptions on φ, it follows immediately from the construction

146

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

[cf. Examples 3.2, (iii); 3.3, (i); 3.4, (i)] of the various p-adic and archimedean
Frobenioids [cf. [FrdII], Example 1.1, (ii); [FrdII], Example 3.3, (ii)] that appear
in an F-prime-strip that it makes sense to speak of the “pull-back” — i.e., by
forming the “categorical ﬁber product” [cf. [FrdI], §0; [FrdI], Proposition 1.6] —
of the Frobenioids that appear in the F-prime-strip 2 F via the various morphisms
at v ∈ V that constitute φ. That is to say, it follows from our assumptions on
φ [cf. also [AbsTopIII], Proposition 3.2, (iv)] that φ determines a pulled-back Fprime-strip “φ∗ (2 F)”, whose associated D-prime-strip [cf. Remark 5.2.1, (i)] is
tautologically equal to 1 D. On the other hand, by Corollary 5.3, (ii), it follows
that this tautological equality of associated D-prime-strips uniquely determines an
∼
isomorphism 1 F → φ∗ (2 F). Then we deﬁne the arrow ψ : 1 F → 2 F to be the
∼
collection of data consisting of φ and this isomorphism 1 F → φ∗ (2 F); we refer to ψ
as the “morphism uniquely determined by φ” or the “uniquely determined morphism
that lies over φ”. Also, we shall apply various terms used to describe a morphism
φ of D-prime-strips to the “arrow” of F-prime-strips determined by φ.
(ii) The conventions discussed in (i) concerning liftings of morphisms of Dprime-strips may also be applied to poly-morphisms. We leave the routine details
to the reader.
Remark 5.3.2. Just as in the case of Corollary 5.3, (i), (ii), the rigidity property
of Corollary 5.3, (iv), may be regarded as being essentially a consequence of the
“Kummer-readiness” [cf. Remarks 5.1.3, 5.2.2] of the tempered Frobenioid F v —
cf. also the arguments applied in the proofs of [AbsTopIII], Proposition 3.2, (iv);
[AbsTopIII], Corollary 5.2, (iv).
Remark 5.3.3. We take this opportunity to rectify a minor oversight in [FrdI].
The hypothesis that the Frobenioids under consideration be of “unit-proﬁnite type”
in [FrdI], Proposition 5.6 — hence also in [FrdI], Corollary 5.7, (iii) — may be
removed. Indeed, if, in the notation of the proof of [FrdI], Proposition 5.6, one
writes φp = cp · φp , where cp ∈ O× (A), for p ∈ Primes, then one has
c2 · c2p · φ2 · φp = c2 · φ2 · cp · φp = φ2 · φp = φp · φ2
= cp · φp · c2 · φ2 = cp · cp2 · φp · φ2 = cp · cp2 · φ2 · φp
— so c2 · c2p = cp · cp2 , i.e., cp = cp−1
, for p ∈ Primes. Thus, φp = c−1
2 · φp · c2 , so by
2
taking u = c−1
2 , one may eliminate the ﬁnal two paragraphs of the proof of [FrdI],
Proposition 5.6.

— i.e., the arrow deﬁned as the collection of data indexed by J for which the

think of † Fj as a copy of † F> “situated on” the constituent labeled j of the capsule
†
DJ ; we think of † FJ as a copy of † F> “situated in a diagonal fashion on” all the
constituents of the capsule † DJ .
(ii) Note that in addition to thinking of † F> as being related to † Fj [for j ∈ J]

via the full poly-isomorphism † F> → † Fj , we may also regard † F> as being related
to † Fj [for j ∈ J] via the poly-morphism

collection of arrows † φΘ

(iii) Next, let † F  , † F  be as in Example 5.1, (iii); δ ∈ LabCusp(† D ). Thus,
[cf. the discussion of Example 4.3, (i)] there exists a unique Aut († D )-orbit of

148

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
∼

isomorphisms † D → D that maps δ → [] ∈ LabCusp(D ). We shall refer to
as a δ-valuation ∈ V(† D ) [cf. Deﬁnition 4.1, (v)] any element that maps to an
element of V±un [cf. Example 4.3, (i)] via this Aut († D )-orbit of isomorphisms.
Note that the notion of a δ-valuation may also be deﬁned intrinsically by means
of the structure of D-NF-bridge † φNF
 . Indeed, [one veriﬁes immediately that] a
δ-valuation may be deﬁned as a valuation ∈ V(† D ) that lies in the “image” [in
†
†
the evident sense] via † φNF
 of the unique D-prime-strip Dj of the capsule DJ

such that the bijection LabCusp(† D ) → LabCusp(† Dj ) induced by † φNF
 [cf. the
†
discussion of Example 4.5, (i)] maps δ to the element of LabCusp( Dj ) that is
“labeled 1”, relative to the bijection of the second display of Proposition 4.2.
(iv) We continue to use the notation of (iii). Then let us observe that by
localizing at each of the δ-valuations ∈ V(† D ), one may construct, in a natural
way, an F-prime-strip
† 
F |δ
— which is well-deﬁned up to isomorphism — from † F  [i.e., in the notation of
× , equipped with its natural π1 († D )-action]. Indeed,
Example 5.1, (iv), from O
at a nonarchimedean δ-valuation v, this follows by considering the pv -adic Frobenioids 
[cf. Remark 3.3.2] associated to the restrictions to suitable open subgroups
of Πp0 π1 († D ) (⊆ π1 († D ) ⊆ π1 († D )) determined by δ ∈ LabCusp(† D ) [i.e.,
X
open subgroups corresponding to the coverings “X”, “−

3.1, (e), (f); cf. also Remark 3.1.2, (i)], where Πp0 is chosen [among its π1 († D )conjugates] so as to correspond to v, of the pairs

of Example 5.1, (v) [cf. also Example 5.1, (vi)]. [Here, we note that, when v
lies over an element of Vbad
mod , one must replace these “suitable open subgroups” by
their tempered analogues, i.e., by applying the mono-anabelian algorithm implicit
in the proof of [SemiAnbd], Theorem 6.6.] On the other hand, at an archimedean δvaluation v, this follows by applying the functorial algorithm for reconstructing the
corresponding Aut-holomorphic orbispace at v given in [AbsTopIII], Corollaries 2.8,
∼
2.9, together with the discussion concerning the “isomorphism M († D ) → † M ”
in Example 5.1, (v) [cf. also Example 5.1, (vi)]. Here, we observe that since
the natural projection map V±un → Vmod fails to be injective, in order to relate
the restrictions obtained at diﬀerent elements in a ﬁber of this map in a welldeﬁned fashion, it is necessary to regard † F  |δ as being well-deﬁned only up to
isomorphism. Nevertheless, despite this indeterminacy inherent in the deﬁnition
of † F  |δ , it still makes sense to deﬁne, for an F-prime-strip ‡ F with underlying
D-prime-strip ‡ D [cf. Remark 5.2.1, (i)], a poly-morphism
‡
∼

F → †F 

to be a full poly-isomorphism ‡ F → † F  |δ for some δ ∈ LabCusp(† D ) [cf. Definition 4.1, (vi)]. Moreover, it makes sense to pre-compose such poly-morphisms
with isomorphisms of F-prime-strips and to post-compose such poly-morphisms
with isomorphisms between isomorphs of † F  . Here, we note that such a polymorphism ‡ F → † F  may be thought of as “lying over” an induced poly-morphism

ﬁxed by pre-composition with automorphisms of ‡ F, as well as by post-composition
with automorphisms ∈ Aut († F  ). Also, we observe that such a poly-morphism
‡
F → † F  is compatible with the local and global ∞ κ-coric structures [cf. Example 5.1, (v); Deﬁnition 5.2, (vi), (viii)] that appear in the domain and codomain
of this poly-morphism in the following sense: the operation of restriction of associated Kummer classes [cf. the discussion of Example 5.1, (v); Deﬁnition 5.2, (vi),
(viii); the constructions discussed in the present item (iv)] determines a collection,
indexed by v ∈ V, of poly-morphisms of pseudo-monoids

— where the global data in the domain of the arrow that appears in the display is regarded as only being deﬁned up to automorphisms induced by inner automorphisms
of π1rat († D ) [cf. the discussion of Example 5.1, (i)]; the local data in the codomain
of the arrow that appears in the display is regarded as only being deﬁned up to automorphisms induced by automorphisms of the F-prime-strip ‡ F [cf. Deﬁnition 5.2,
(vi), (viii); Corollary 5.3, (ii)]; the arrow of the display is equivariant with respect to
the various homomorphisms π1rat (‡ Dv ) → π1rat († D ) [i.e., relative to the respective
actions of these groups on the pseudo-monoids in the domain and codomain of the

the theory summarized in [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9, and [AbsTopIII], Corollaries
1.10, 2.8] by the given poly-morphism ‡ F → † F  ; when v ∈ Varc , we regard the
pseudo-monoids ‡ M∞ κv ⊆ ‡ M∞ κ×v as being equipped with the various splittings
discussed in Deﬁnition 5.2, (viii). Finally, if {e F}e∈E is a capsule of F-prime-strips
whose associated capsule of D-prime-strips [cf. Remark 5.2.1, (i)] we denote by
{e D}e∈E , then we deﬁne a poly-morphism

to be a collection of poly-morphisms {e F → † F  }e∈E (respectively, {e F → † F}e∈E )
[cf. Deﬁnition 4.1, (vi)]. Thus, a poly-morphism {e F}e∈E → † F  (respectively,
{e F}e∈E → † F) may be thought of as “lying over” an induced poly-morphism
{e D}e∈E → † D (respectively, {e D}e∈E → † D) [cf. Deﬁnition 4.1, (vi)].

Remark 5.4.1. The constructions of Example 5.4, (i), (ii) (respectively, Example

[cf. Remark 5.1.2].
Remark 5.4.2.

and its re(i) At this point, it is useful to consider the various copies of † Fmod
aliﬁcations introduced so far from the point of view of “log-volumes”, i.e., arithmetic degrees [cf., e.g., the discussion of [FrdI], Example 6.3; [FrdI], Theorem 6.4;
Remark 3.1.5 of the present paper]. That is to say, since † Fj may be thought of as

a sort of “section of † FJ over † Fmod
the discussion of prime-strips in Remark 4.3.1] — one way to think of log-volumes

of † FJ
is as quantities that diﬀer by a factor of l — i.e., corresponding, to the

to thinking of arithmetic degrees that appear in the various factors of † FJ as being

appear in † FJ
This sort of averaging may be thought of as a sort of abstract, Frobenioid-theoretic
analogue of the normalization of arithmetic degrees that is often used in the theory
of heights [cf., e.g., [GenEll], Deﬁnition 1.2, (i)] that allows one to work with heights
in such a way that the height of a point remains invariant with respect to change
of the base ﬁeld.
(ii) On the other hand, to work with the various isomorphisms of Frobenioids

— involved amounts [since the arithmetic degree is an
— such as † Fj → † FJ
intrinsic invariant of the Frobenioids involved — cf. [FrdI], Theorem 6.4, (iv);
Remark 3.1.5 of the present paper] to thinking of arithmetic degrees that appear
in the various factors of † FJ as being
summed [i.e., without dividing by a factor of l ] over the elements of J

and hence of arithmetic degrees that appear in † FJ
as the “resulting
sums”.
This point of view may be thought of as a sort of abstract, Frobenioid-theoretic
analogue of the normalization of arithmetic degrees or heights in which the height
of a point is multiplied by the degree of the ﬁeld extension when one executes a
change of the base ﬁeld.
The notions deﬁned in the following “Frobenioid-theoretic lifting” of Deﬁnition
4.6 will play a central role in the theory of the present series of papers.

they induce the same bijection between the index sets of the respective capsules of

Corollary 5.6.
(Isomorphisms of Θ-Hodge Theaters, NF-Bridges, ΘBridges, and ΘNF-Hodge Theaters) Relative to a ﬁxed collection of initial
Θ-data:
(i) The natural functorially induced map from the set of isomorphisms between two Θ-Hodge theaters to the set of isomorphisms between the respective
associated D-prime-strips [cf. the discussion preceding Example 5.4; Remark
5.2.1, (i)] is bijective.
(ii) The natural functorially induced map from the set of isomorphisms between two NF-bridges (respectively, two Θ-bridges; two ΘNF-Hodge theaters) to the set of isomorphisms between the respective associated D-NF-bridges

154

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

(respectively, associated D-Θ-bridges; associated D-ΘNF-Hodge theaters) is
bijective.
(iii) Given an NF-bridge and a Θ-bridge, the set of capsule-full poly-isomorphisms
between the respective capsules of F-prime-strips which allow one to glue the given
NF- and Θ-bridges together to form a ΘNF-Hodge theater forms an F
l -torsor.
Proof. First, we consider assertion (i). Sorting through the data listed in the
deﬁnition of a Θ-Hodge theater † HT Θ [cf. Deﬁnition 3.6], one veriﬁes immediately
that the only data that is not contained in the associated F-prime-strip † F> [cf.
the discussion preceding Example 5.4] is the global data of Deﬁnition 3.6, (c), and
the tempered Frobenioids isomorphic to “F v ” [cf. Example 3.2, (i)] at the v ∈ Vbad .
That is to say, for v ∈ Vgood , one veriﬁes immediately that
†

F>,v

=

†

Fv

[cf. Example 3.3, (i); Example 3.4, (i); Deﬁnition 3.6; Deﬁnition 5.2, (i)]. On
the other hand, one veriﬁes immediately that this global data may be obtained
by applying the functorial algorithm “‡ F → ‡ F ” summarized in the second
display of Remark 5.2.1, (ii), to the associated F-prime-strips that appear. Thus,
assertion (i) follows by applying Corollary 5.3, (ii), to the associated F-primestrips and Corollary 5.3, (iv), to the various tempered Frobenioids at v ∈ Vbad .
This completes the proof of assertion (i). In light of assertion (i), assertions (ii),
(iii) follow immediately from the deﬁnitions and Corollary 5.3, (i), (ii) [cf. also
Proposition 4.8, (iii), in the case of assertion (iii)]. 
Remark 5.6.1. Observe that the various “functorial dynamics” studied in
§4 — i.e., more precisely, analogues of Propositions 4.8, (i), (ii); 4.9; 4.11 — apply
to the NF-bridges, Θ-bridges, and ΘNF-Hodge theaters studied in the present §5.
Indeed, such analogues follow immediately from Corollaries 5.3, (ii), (iii); 5.6, (ii).

Section 6: Additive Combinatorial Teichmüller Theory
In the present §6, we discuss the additive analogue — i.e., which revolves
around the “functorial dynamics” that arise from labels
∈ Fl
— of the “multiplicative combinatorial Teichmüller theory” developed in §4 for
labels ∈ F
l . These considerations lead naturally to certain enhancements of the
various Hodge theaters considered in §5. On the other hand, despite the resemblance
of the theory of the present §6 to the theory of §4, §5, the theory of the present
§6 is, in certain respects — especially those respects that form the analogue of the
theory of §5 — substantially technically simpler.
In the following, we ﬁx a collection of initial Θ-data
(F /F, XF , l, C K , V, Vbad
mod , )
as in Deﬁnition 3.1; also, we shall use the various notations introduced in Deﬁnition
3.1 for various objects associated to this initial Θ-data.
Deﬁnition 6.1.
(i) We shall write

for the group determined by forming the semi-direct product with respect to the

that maps to +1
natural inclusion {±1} → F×
l and refer to an element of Fl

(respectively, −1) via the natural surjection Fl  {±1} as positive (respectively,
negative). We shall refer to as an F±
l -group any set E equipped with a {±1}-orbit
∼
±
of bijections E → Fl . Thus, any Fl -group E is equipped with a natural Fl -module
±
structure. We shall refer to as an F±
l -torsor any set T equipped with an Fl -orbit
∼
of bijections T → Fl [relative to the action of F±
on Fl by automorphisms of
l
the form Fl  z → ±z + λ ∈ Fl , for λ ∈ Fl ]. Thus, if T is an F±
l -torsor, then the
abelian group of automorphisms of the underlying set of Fl given by the translations
Fl  z → z + λ ∈ Fl , for λ ∈ Fl , determines an abelian group
Aut+ (T )
of “positive automorphisms” of the underlying set of T . Moreover, Aut+ (T ) is
equipped with a natural structure of F±
l -group [such that the abelian group structure of Aut+ (T ) coincides with the Fl -module structure of Aut+ (T ) induced by this
±
F±
l -group structure]. Finally, if T is an Fl -torsor, then we shall write
Aut± (T )
for the group of automorphisms of the underlying set of T determined [relative to
the F±
l -torsor structure on T ] by the group of automorphisms of the underlying set
of Fl given by F±
[so Aut+ (T ) ⊆ Aut± (T ) is the unique subgroup of index 2].

(ii) Let

†

D = {† Dv }v∈V

be a D-prime-strip [relative to the given initial Θ-data]. Observe [cf. the discussion
of Deﬁnition 4.1, (i)] that if v ∈ Vnon , then π1 († Dv ) determines, in a functorial
fashion, a topological [in fact, proﬁnite if v ∈ Vgood ] group corresponding to “X v ”
[cf. Corollary 1.2 if v ∈ Vgood ; [EtTh], Proposition 2.4, if v ∈ Vbad ], which contains
0
π1 († Dv ) as an open subgroup; thus, if we write † D±
v for B(−) of this topological
group, then we obtain a natural morphism † Dv → † D±
v [cf. §0]. In a similar vein, if
arc
v ∈ V , then since −
X
→v admits a Kv -core, a routine translation into the “language
of Aut-holomorphic orbispaces” of the argument given in the proof of Corollary 1.2
[cf. also [AbsTopIII], Corollary 2.4] reveals that † Dv determines, in a functorial
fashion, an Aut-holomorphic orbispace † D±
v corresponding to “X v ”, together with
†
† ±
a natural morphism Dv → Dv of Aut-holomorphic orbispaces. Thus, in summary,
one obtains a collection of data
†

D± = {† D±

completely determined by † D.
(iii) Suppose that we are in the situation of (ii). Then observe [cf. the discussion of Deﬁnition 4.1, (ii)] that by applying the group-theoretic algorithm of
[AbsTopI], Lemma 4.5 [cf. also Remark 1.2.2, (ii), of the present paper], to the
topological group π1 († Dv ) when v ∈ Vnon , or by considering π0 (−) of a coﬁnal
collection of “neighborhoods of inﬁnity” [i.e., complements of compact subsets] of
the underlying topological space of † Dv when v ∈ Varc , it makes sense to speak of
the set of cusps of † Dv ; a similar observation applies to † D±
v , for v ∈ V. If v ∈ V,
†
then we deﬁne a ±-label class of cusps of Dv to be the set of cusps of † Dv that lie
over a single cusp [i.e., corresponding to an arbitrary element of the quotient “Q”
that appears in the deﬁnition of a “hyperbolic orbicurve of type (1, l-tors)” given
in [EtTh], Deﬁnition 2.1] of † D±
v ; write
LabCusp± († Dv )
for the set of ±-label classes of cusps of † Dv . Thus, [for any v ∈ V!] LabCusp± († Dv )
admits a natural action by F×

natural bijection to “LabCusp(−)” of the preceding display, with the natural bijection of the second display of Proposition 4.2. That is to say, in the terminology of

(i), LabCusp± († Dv ) is equipped with a natural F±
l -group structure. This Fl -group
structure determines a natural surjection
Aut(† Dv )  {±1}
— i.e., by considering the induced automorphism of LabCusp± († Dv ). Write
Aut+ († Dv ) ⊆ Aut(† Dv )
for the index two subgroup of “positive automorphisms” [i.e., the kernel of the above
def

surjection] and Aut− († Dv ) = Aut(† Dv ) \ Aut+ († Dv ) [i.e., where “\” denotes the
set-theoretic complement] for the subset of “negative automorphisms”. In a similar
vein, we shall write
Aut+ († D) ⊆ Aut(† D)
for the subgroup of “positive automorphisms” [i.e., automorphisms each of whose
components, for v ∈ V, is positive], and, if α ∈ {±1}V [i.e., where we write {±1}V
for the set of set-theoretic maps from V to {±1}],
Autα († D) ⊆ Aut(† D)
for the subset of “α-signed automorphisms” [i.e., automorphisms each of whose

(iv) Suppose that we are in the situation of (ii). Let

D± = B(X K )0
def

[cf. §0; the situation discussed in Deﬁnition 4.1, (v)]. Thus, we have a ﬁnite étale
double covering D± → D = B(C K )0 . Just as in the case of D [cf. Example
4.3, (i)], one may construct, in a category-theoretic fashion from D± , the outer
homomorphism
Aut(D± ) → GL2 (Fl )/{±1}
arising from the l-torsion points of the elliptic curve EF [i.e., from the Galois action on Δab
X ⊗ Fl ]. Moreover, it follows from the construction of X K that, relative
∼
to the natural isomorphism Aut(D± ) → Aut(X K ) [cf., e.g., [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9], the image of the above outer homomorphism is equal to a subgroup of
GL2 (Fl )/{±1} that contains a Borel subgroup of SL2 (Fl )/{±1} [cf. the discussion
of Example 4.3, (i)] — i.e., the Borel subgroup corresponding to the rank one quotient of Δab
X ⊗ Fl that gives rise to the covering X K → XK . In particular, this rank
one quotient determines a natural surjective homomorphism
Aut(D± )  F
l
[which may be reconstructed category-theoretically from D± !] — whose kernel
we denote by Aut± (D± ) ⊆ Aut(D± ). One veriﬁes immediately that the sub∼
group Aut± (D± ) ⊆ Aut(D± ) → Aut(X K ) contains the subgroup AutK (X K ) ⊆
Aut(X K ) of K-linear automorphisms and acts transitively on the cusps of X K .
Next, let us write Autcsp (D± ) ⊆ Aut± (D± ) for the subgroup [which may be reconstructed category-theoretically from D± ! — cf. [AbsTopI], Lemma 4.5, as well
as Remark 1.2.2, (ii), of the present paper] of automorphisms that ﬁx the cusps of
X K . Then one obtains natural outer isomorphisms

[cf. the discussion preceding [EtTh], Deﬁnition 2.1] — where the second outer

unique index two subgroup containing Autcsp (D± ), then the cusp  determines a
natural F±

Aut+ (D± )/Autcsp (D± )

D±

be any category isomorphic to D± . Then just as in the discussion of (iii) in the
case of “v ∈ Vnon ”, it makes sense [cf. [AbsTopI], Lemma 4.5, as well as Remark
1.2.2, (ii), of the present paper] to speak of the set of cusps of † D± , as well as the
set of ±-label classes of cusps
LabCusp± († D± )
— which, in this case, may be identiﬁed with the set of cusps of † D± .
(vii) Recall from [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9 [applied via the “Θ-approach” discussed in Remark 3.1.2], that [just as in the case of D — cf. the discussion of
Deﬁnition 4.1, (v)] there exists a group-theoretic algorithm for reconstructing, from
π1 (D± ) [cf. §0], the algebraic closure “F ” of the base ﬁeld “K”, hence also the set
of valuations “V(F )” from D± [e.g., as a collection of topologies on F — cf., e.g.,
[AbsTopIII], Corollary 2.8]. Moreover, for w ∈ V(K)arc , let us recall [cf. Remark
3.1.2; [AbsTopIII], Corollaries 2.8, 2.9] that one may reconstruct group-theoretically,
from π1 (D± ), the Aut-holomorphic orbispace Xw associated to X w . Let † D± be
as in (vi). Then let us write
V(† D± )
for the set of valuations [i.e., “V(F )”], equipped with its natural π1 († D± )-action,
V(† D± )

def

=

V(† D± )/π1 († D± )

for the quotient of V(† D± ) by π1 († D± ) [i.e., “V(K)”], and, for w ∈ V(† D± )arc ,
X(† D± , w)
[i.e., “Xw ” — cf. the discussion of [AbsTopIII], Deﬁnition 5.1, (ii)] for the Autholomorphic orbispace obtained by applying these group-theoretic reconstruction
algorithms to π1 († D± ). Now if U is an arbitrary Aut-holomorphic orbispace, then
let us deﬁne a morphism
U → † D±
to be a morphism of Aut-holomorphic orbispaces [cf. [AbsTopIII], Deﬁnition 2.1,
(ii)] U → X(† D± , w) for some w ∈ V(† D± )arc . Thus, it makes sense to speak of
the pre-composite (respectively, post-composite) of such a morphism U → † D±
with a morphism of Aut-holomorphic orbispaces (respectively, with an isomorphism
∼
[cf. §0] † D± → ‡ D± [i.e., where ‡ D± is a category equivalent to D± ]).
Remark 6.1.1. In fact, in the notation of Example 4.3, (i); Deﬁnition 6.1, (v), it
is not diﬃcult to verify [cf. Remark 3.1.2, (i)] that V± = V±un (⊆ V(K)).

Fig. 6.1: The combinatorial structure of a D-Θ±ell -Hodge theater
Remark 6.6.1.
The underlying combinatorial structure of a D-Θ±ell -Hodge
theater — or, essentially equivalently [cf. Deﬁnition 6.11, Corollary 6.12 below], of

a Θ±ell -Hodge theater — is illustrated in Fig. 6.1 above. Thus, Fig. 6.1 may be
thought of as a sort of additive analogue of the multiplicative situation illustrated
in Fig. 4.4. In Fig. 6.1, the “⇑” corresponds to the associated [D-]Θ± -bridge, while
the “⇓” corresponds to the associated [D-]Θell -bridge; the “/± ’s” denote D-primestrips.

D-prime-strips — i.e., the D-prime-strips corresponding to the ﬁrst “/± ” in the processions just discussed — in the various spokes are identiﬁed with one another.
Put another way, the coric D -prime-strip “> ” may be thought of as being equipped
with various distinct “holomorphic structures” — i.e., D-prime-strip structures that give rise to the D -prime-strip structure — corresponding to the various

Remark 6.12.1. By applying Corollary 6.12, a similar remark to Remark 5.6.1
may be made concerning the Θ± -bridges, Θell -bridges, and Θ±ell -Hodge theaters
studied in the present §6. We leave the routine details to the reader.
Remark 6.12.2. Relative to a ﬁxed collection of initial Θ-data:
(i) Suppose that († FT → † F ) is a Θ± -bridge; write († DT → † D ) for
the associated D-Θ± -bridge [cf. Deﬁnition 6.11, (i)]. Then Proposition 6.7 gives
a functorial algorithm for constructing a D-Θ-bridge († DT  → † D> ) from this
D-Θ± -bridge († DT → † D ). Suppose that this D-Θ-bridge († DT  → † D> )
arises as the D-Θ-bridge associated to a Θ-bridge (‡ FJ → ‡ F>  ‡ HT Θ ) [so
J = T  — cf. Deﬁnition 5.5, (ii)]. Then since the portion “‡ FJ → ‡ F> ” of this
Θ-bridge is completely determined [cf. Deﬁnition 5.5, (ii), (d)] by the associated
D-Θ-bridge, one veriﬁes immediately that
one may regard this portion “‡ FJ → ‡ F> ” of the Θ-bridge as having been
constructed via a functorial algorithm similar to the functorial algorithm of
Proposition 6.7 [cf. also Deﬁnition 5.5, (ii), (d); the discussion of Remark
5.3.1] from the Θ± -bridge († FT → † F ).
Since, moreover, isomorphisms between Θ-bridges are in natural bijective correspondence with isomorphisms between the associated D-Θ-bridges [cf. Corollary
5.6, (ii)], it thus follows immediately [cf. Corollary 5.3, (ii)] that isomorphisms
between Θ-bridges are in natural bijective correspondence with isomorphisms between the portions of Θ-bridges [i.e., “‡ FJ → ‡ F> ”] considered above. Thus, in
‡
summary, if (‡ FJ → ‡ F> 
HT Θ ) is a Θ-bridge for which the portion
“‡ FJ → ‡ F> ” is obtained via the functorial algorithm discussed above from the
Θ± -bridge († FT → † F ), then, for simplicity, we shall describe this state of aﬀairs
by saying that
the Θ-bridge (‡ FJ → ‡ F>  ‡ HT Θ ) is glued to the Θ± -bridge
(† FT → † F ) via the functorial algorithm of Proposition 6.7.
We leave the routine details of giving a more explicit description [say, in the style
of the statement of Proposition 6.7] of such functorial algorithms to the reader. A
similar [but easier!] construction may be given for D-Θ-bridges and D-Θ± -bridges.
(ii) Now observe that
by gluing a Θ±ell -Hodge theater [cf. Deﬁnition 6.11, (iii)] to a ΘNFHodge theater [cf. Deﬁnition 5.5, (iii)] along the respective associated
Θ± - and Θ-bridges via the functorial algorithm of Proposition 6.7 [cf. (i)],
one obtains the notion of a
“Θ±ell NF-Hodge theater”
— cf. Deﬁnition 6.13, (i), below. Here, we note that by Proposition 4.8, (ii);
Corollary 5.6, (ii), the gluing isomorphism that occurs in such a gluing operation
is unique. Then by applying Propositions 4.8, 6.6, and Corollaries 5.6, 6.12, one

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY I

175

may verify analogues of these results for such Θ±ell NF-Hodge theaters. In a similar
vein, one may glue a D-Θ±ell -Hodge theater to a D-ΘNF-Hodge theater to obtain a
“D-Θ±ell NF-Hodge theater” [cf. Deﬁnition 6.13, (ii), below]. We leave the routine
details to the reader.
Remark 6.12.3.
(i) One way to think of the notion of a ΘNF-Hodge theater studied in §4 is as
a sort of
total space of a local system of F
l -torsors
over a “base space” that represents a sort of “homotopy” between a number ﬁeld
and a Tate curve [i.e., the elliptic curve under consideration at the v ∈ Vbad ]. From
this point of view, the notion of a Θ±ell -Hodge theater studied in the present §6
may be thought of as a sort of
total space of a local system of F±
l -torsors
±
over a similar “base space”. Here, it is interesting to note that these F
l - and Fl torsors arise, on the one hand, from the l-torsion points of the elliptic curve under
consideration, hence may be thought of as

discrete approximations of
[the geometric portion of ] this elliptic curve over a number ﬁeld
[cf. the point of view of scheme-theoretic Hodge-Arakelov theory discussed in [HASurI], §1.3.4]. On the other hand, if one thinks in terms of the tempered fundamental
±
groups of the Tate curves that occur at v ∈ Vbad , then these F
l - and Fl -torsors
may be thought of as
ﬁnite approximations of the copy of “Z”
that occurs as the Galois group of a well-known tempered covering of the Tate
curve [cf. the discussion of [EtTh], Remark 2.16.2]. Note, moreover, that if one
works with Θ±ell NF-Hodge theaters [cf. Remark 6.12.2, (ii)], then one is, in eﬀect,
working with both the additive and the multiplicative structures of this copy
of Z — although, unlike the situation that occurs when one works with rings,
i.e., in which the additive and multiplicative structures are “entangled” with
one another in some sort of complicated fashion [cf. the discussion of [AbsTopIII],
Remark 5.6.1], if one works with Θ±ell NF-Hodge theaters, then each of the additive
and multiplicative structures occurs in an independent fashion [i.e., in the form of
Θ±ell - and ΘNF-Hodge theaters], i.e., “extracted” from this entanglement.
(ii) At this point, it is useful to recall that the idea of a distinct [i.e., from the
copy of Z implicit in the “base space”] “local system-theoretic” copy of Z occurring
over a “base space” that represents a number ﬁeld is reminiscent not only of the
discussion of [EtTh], Remark 2.16.2, but also of the Teichmüller-theoretic point of
view discussed in [AbsTopIII], §I5. That is to say, relative to the analogy with p-adic
Teichmüller theory, the “base space” that represents a number ﬁeld corresponds to
a hyperbolic curve in positive characteristic, while the “local system-theoretic”

176

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

copy of Z — which, as discussed in (i), also serves as a discrete approximation of
the [geometric portion of the] elliptic curve under consideration — corresponds to
a nilpotent ordinary indigenous bundle over the positive characteristic hyperbolic
curve.
(iii) Relative to the analogy discussed in (ii) between the “local system-theoretic”
copy of Z of (i) and the indigenous bundles that occur in p-adic Teichmüller theory,
it is interesting to note that the two combinatorial dimensions [cf. [AbsTopIII], Remark 5.6.1] corresponding to the additive and multiplicative [i.e., “F±
l -” and

±ell
“Fl -”] symmetries of Θ -, ΘNF-Hodge theaters may be thought of as corresponding, respectively, to the two real dimensions
· z → z + a,
· z →

z → −z + a;

z · cos(t) − sin(t)
,
z · sin(t) + cos(t)

z →

z · cos(t) + sin(t)
z · sin(t) − cos(t)

— where a, t ∈ R; z denotes the standard coordinate on H — of transformations of
the upper half-plane H, i.e., an object that is very closely related to the canonical
indigenous bundles that occur in the classical complex uniformization theory of
hyperbolic Riemann surfaces [cf. the discussions of Remarks 4.3.3, 5.1.4]. Here,
it is also of interest to observe that the above additive symmetry of the upper
half-plane is closely related to the coordinate on the upper half-plane determined
by the “classical q-parameter”
q

def

=

e2πiz

— a situation that is reminiscent of the close relationship, in the theory of the
present series of papers, between the F±
l -symmetry and the Kummer theory
surrounding the Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic evaluation of the theta function on the
l-torsion points at bad primes [cf. Remark 6.12.6, (ii), below; the theory of
[IUTchII]]. Moreover, the ﬁxed basepoint “V± ” [cf. Deﬁnition 6.1, (v)] with respect
to which one considers l-torsion points in the context of the F±
l -symmetry is reminiscent of the fact that the above additive symmetries of the upper half-plane ﬁx
the cusp at inﬁnity. Indeed, taken as a whole, the geometry and coordinate naturally associated to this additive symmetry of the upper half-plane may be thought
of, at the level of “combinatorial prototypes”, as the geometric apparatus associated to a cusp [i.e., as opposed to a node — cf. the discussion of [NodNon],
Introduction]. By contrast, the “toral” multiplicative symmetry of the upper
half-plane recalled above is closely related to the coordinate on the upper half-plane
that determines a biholomorphic isomorphism with the unit disc

§5 of the present paper]. Moreover, the action of F
l on the “collection of basepoints

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY I

the F
l -symmetry is reminiscent of the fact that the multiplicative symmetries of
the upper half-plane recalled above act transitively on the entire boundary of the
upper half-plane. That is to say, taken as a whole, the geometry and coordinate
naturally associated to this multiplicative symmetry of the upper half-plane may
be thought of, at the level of “combinatorial prototypes”, as the geometric
apparatus associated to a node, i.e., of the sort that occurs in the reduction modulo
p of a Hecke correspondence [cf. the discussion of [IUTchII], Remark 4.11.4, (iii),
(c); [NodNon], Introduction]. Finally, we note that, just as in the case of the

F±
l -, Fl -symmetries discussed in the present paper, the only “coric” symmetries,
i.e., symmetries common to both the additive and multiplicative symmetries of the
upper half-plane recalled above, are the symmetries “{±1}” [i.e., the symmetries
z → z, −z in the case of the upper half-plane]. The observations of the above
discussion are summarized in Fig. 6.4 below.
Remark 6.12.4.
±
(i) Just as in the case of the F
l -symmetry of Proposition 4.9, (i), the Fl symmetry of Proposition 6.8, (i), will eventually be applied, in the theory of the
present series of papers [cf. theory of [IUTchII], [IUTchIII]], to establish an

explicit network of comparison isomorphisms
relating various objects — such as log-volumes — associated to the non-labeled
prime-strips that are permuted by this symmetry [cf. the discussion of Remark
4.9.1, (i)]. Moreover, just as in the case of the F
l -symmetry studied in §4 [cf. the
discussion of Remark 4.9.2], one important property of this “network of comparison
isomorphisms” is that it operates without “label crushing” [cf. Remark 4.9.2, (i)]
— i.e., without disturbing the bijective relationship between the set of indices of
∼
the symmetrized collection of prime-strips and the set of labels ∈ T → Fl under
consideration. Finally, just as in the situation studied in §4,
this crucial synchronization of labels is essentially a consequence of
the single connected component
— or, at a more abstract level, the single basepoint — of the global object [i.e.,
“† D± ” in the present §6; “† D ” in §4] that appears in the [D-Θ±ell - or D-ΘNF-]
Hodge theater under consideration [cf. Remark 4.9.2, (ii)].
(ii) At a more concrete level, the “synchronization of labels” discussed in (i) is
realized by means of the crucial bijections
†

∼

ζ : LabCusp(† D ) → J;

†

∼

ζ± : LabCusp± († D± ) → T

of Propositions 4.7, (iii); 6.5, (iii). Here, we pause to observe that it is precisely the
existence of these
bijections relating index sets of capsules of D-prime-strips to sets of
global [±-]label classes of cusps

l - and Fl -symmetries of Propositions 4.9, (i); 6.8, (i), from
the coarser “combinatorially real analytic” [cf. Remarks 4.9.1, (ii); 4.9.2, (iv)]
Sl - and Sl± -symmetries of Propositions 4.9, (ii), (iii); 6.8, (ii), (iii) — i.e., which
do not admit a compatible bijection between the index sets of the capsules involved
and some sort of set of [±-]label classes of cusps [cf. the discussion of Remark 4.9.2,
(i)]. This relationship with a set of [±-]label classes of cusps will play a crucial role
in the theory of the Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic evaluation of the étale theta function
that will be developed in [IUTchII].

(iii) On the other hand, one signiﬁcant feature of the additive theory of the
present §6 which does not appear in the multiplicative theory of §4 is the phenomenon of “global ±-synchronization” — i.e., at a more concrete level, the
various isomorphisms “† ξ” that appear in Proposition 6.5, (i), (ii) — between
the ±-indeterminacies that occur at the various v ∈ V. Note that this global
±-synchronization is a necessary “pre-condition” [i.e., since the natural additive action of Fl on Fl is not compatible with the natural surjection Fl  |Fl |] for
±
the additive portion [i.e., corresponding to Fl ⊆ F±
l ] of the Fl -symmetry of
Proposition 6.8, (i). This “additive portion” of the F±
l -symmetry plays the crucial
role of allowing one to relate the zero and nonzero elements of Fl [cf. the discussion
of Remark 6.12.5 below].
(iv) One important property of both the “† ζ’s” discussed in (ii) and the “† ξ’s”
discussed in (iii) is that they are constructed by means of functorial algorithms
from the intrinsic structure of a D-Θ±ell - or D-ΘNF-Hodge theater [cf. Propositions
4.7, (iii); 6.5, (i), (ii), (iii)] — i.e., not by means of comparison with some ﬁxed
reference model [cf. the discussion of [AbsTopIII], §I4], such as the objects
constructed in Examples 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 6.2, 6.3. This property will be of crucial
importance when, in the theory of [IUTchIII], we combine the theory developed in
the present series of papers with the theory of log-shells developed in [AbsTopIII].
Remark 6.12.5.
±
(i) One fundamental diﬀerence between the F
l -symmetry of §4 and the Fl symmetry of the present §6 lies in the inclusion of the zero element ∈ Fl in the
symmetry under consideration. This inclusion of the zero element ∈ Fl means,
in particular, that the resulting network of comparison isomorphisms [cf. Remark
6.12.4, (i)]

allows one to relate the “zero-labeled” prime-strip to the various “nonzerolabeled” prime-strips, i.e., the prime-strips labeled by nonzero elements
∈ Fl [or, essentially equivalently, ∈ F
l ].
Moreover, as reviewed in Remark 6.12.4, (ii), the F±
l -symmetry allows one to
relate the zero-labeled and non-zero-labeled prime-strips to one another in a “combinatorially holomorphic” fashion, i.e., in a fashion that is compatible with the
various natural bijections [i.e., “† ζ”] with various sets of global ±-label classes of
cusps. Here, it is useful to recall that evaluation at [torsion points closely related to]
the zero-labeled cusps [cf. the discussion of “evaluation points” in Example 4.4, (i)]
plays an important role in the theory of normalization of the étale theta function

180

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

— cf. the theory of étale theta functions “of standard type”, as discussed in [EtTh],
Theorem 1.10; the theory to be developed in [IUTchII].
(ii) Whereas the F±
l -symmetry of the theory of the present §6 has the advantage that it allows one to relate zero-labeled and non-zero-labeled prime-strips,
it has the [tautological!] disadvantage that it does not allow one to “insulate”
the non-zero-labeled prime-strips from confusion with the zero-labeled prime-strip.
This issue will be of substantial importance in the theory of Gaussian Frobenioids
[to be developed in [IUTchII]], i.e., Frobenioids that, roughly speaking, arise from
the theta values
j2
}j
{q
v

[cf. the discussion of Example 4.4, (i)] at the non-zero-labeled evaluation points.
Moreover, ultimately, in [IUTchII], [IUTchIII], we shall relate these Gaussian Frobenioids to various global arithmetic line bundles on the number ﬁeld F . This will
require the use of both the additive and the multiplicative structures on the number
ﬁeld; in particular, it will require the use of the theory developed in §5.
(iii) By contrast, since, in the theory of the present series of papers, we shall
not be interested in analogues of the Gaussian Frobenioids that involve the zerolabeled evaluation points, we shall not require an “additive analogue” of the portion
[cf. Example 5.1] of the theory developed in §5 concerning global Frobenioids.
Remark 6.12.6.
(i) Another fundamental diﬀerence between the F
l -symmetry of §4 and the
±
Fl -symmetry of the present §6 lies in the geometric nature of the “single basepoint” [cf. the discussion of Remark 6.12.4] that underlies the F±
l -symmetry. That
∼
±ell
is to say, the various labels ∈ T → Fl that appear in a [D-]Θ -Hodge theater cor±ell

respond — throughout the various portions [e.g., bridges] of the [D-]Θ -Hodge
theater — to collections of cusps in a single copy [i.e., connected component] of
“Dv ” at each v ∈ V; these collections of cusps are permuted by the F±
l -symmetry
ell
of the [D-]Θ -bridge [cf. Proposition 6.8, (i)] without permuting the collection of
valuations V± (⊆ V(K)) [cf. the discussion of Deﬁnition 6.1, (v)]. This contrasts
sharply with the arithmetic nature of the “single basepoint” [cf. the discussion
of Remark 6.12.4] that underlies the F
l -symmetry of §4, i.e., in the sense that

the Fl -symmetry [cf. Proposition 4.9, (i)] permutes the various F
l -translates of
±
±un
Bor
⊆V
(⊆ V(K)) [cf. Example 4.3, (i); Remark 6.1.1].
V =V
(ii) The geometric nature of the “single basepoint” of the F±
l -symmetry of
±ell
a [D-]Θ -Hodge theater [cf. (i)] is more suited to the theory of the
Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic evaluation of the étale theta function

to be developed in [IUTchII], in which the existence of a “single basepoint” corresponding to a single connected component of “Dv ” for v ∈ Vbad plays a central
role.
(iii) By contrast, the arithmetic nature of the “single basepoint” of the F
l symmetry of a [D-]ΘNF-Hodge theater [cf. (i)] is more suited to the

INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY I

181

explicit construction of the number ﬁeld Fmod [cf. Example 5.1]
— i.e., to the construction of an object which is invariant with respect to the
∼
Aut(C K )/Aut (C K ) → F
l -symmetries that appear in the discussion of Example
4.3, (iv). That is to say, if one attempts to carry out a similar construction to
the construction of Example 5.1 with respect to the copy of D± that appears
in a [D-]Θell -bridge, then one must sacriﬁce the crucial ridigity with respect to
∼
Aut(D± )/Aut± (D± ) → F
l [cf. Deﬁnition 6.1, (v)] that arises from the structure [i.e., deﬁnition] of a [D-]Θell -bridge [cf. Example 6.3; Deﬁnition 6.4, (ii)].
Moreover, if one sacriﬁces this F
l -rigidity, then one no longer has a situation in
which the symmetry under consideration is deﬁned relative to a single copy of “Dv ”
at each v ∈ V, i.e., deﬁned with respect to a “single geometric basepoint”. In particular, once one sacriﬁces this F
l -rigidity, the resulting symmetries are no longer
compatible with the theory of the Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic evaluation of the étale
theta function to be developed in [IUTchII] [cf. (ii)].
(iv) One way to understand the diﬀerence discussed in (iii) between the global
portions [i.e., the portions involving copies of D , D± ] of a [D-]ΘNF-Hodge theater
and a [D-]Θ±ell -Hodge theater is as a reﬂection of the fact that whereas the Borel
subgroup


∗ ∗
⊆ SL2 (Fl )
0 ∗
is normally terminal in SL2 (Fl ) [cf. the discussion of Example 4.3], the “semiunipotent” subgroup


±1 ∗
⊆ SL2 (Fl )
0 ±1
[which corresponds to the subgroup Aut± (D± ) ⊆ Aut(D± ) — cf. the discussion
of Deﬁnition 6.1, (v)] fails to be normally terminal in SL2 (Fl ).
(v) In summary, taken as a whole, a [D-]Θ±ell NF-Hodge theater [cf. Remark
6.12.2, (ii)] may be thought of as a sort of
“intricate relay between geometric and arithmetic basepoints”
that allows one to carry out, in a consistent fashion, both
(a) the theory of the Hodge-Arakelov-theoretic evaluation of the étale theta
function to be developed in [IUTchII] [cf. (ii)] and
(b) the explicit construction of the number ﬁeld Fmod in Example 5.1 [cf.
(iii)].
Moreover, if one thinks of Fl as a ﬁnite approximation of Z [cf. Remark 6.12.3],
then this intricate relay between geometric and arithmetic — or, alternatively, F±
l
[i.e., additive!]- and F
[i.e.,
multiplicative!]basepoints
—
may
be
thought
of
as
a
l
sort of
global combinatorial resolution of the two combinatorial dimensions — i.e., additive and multiplicative [cf. [AbsTopIII], Remark
5.6.1] — of the ring Z.

182

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

Finally, we observe in passing that — from a computational point of view [cf. the
theory of [IUTchIV]!] — it is especially natural to regard Fl as a “good approximation” of Z when l is “suﬃciently large”, as is indeed the case in the situations
discussed in [GenEll], §4 [cf. also Remark 3.1.2, (iv)].
