The Mathematics of Mutually Alien Copies: from
Gaussian Integrals to Inter-universal Teichmüller
Theory
By

Shinichi Mochizuki

Abstract
Inter-universal Teichmüller theory may be described as a construction of certain
canonical deformations of the ring structure of a number ﬁeld
equipped with certain auxiliary data, which includes an elliptic curve over the number ﬁeld
and a prime number ≥ 5. In the present paper, we survey this theory by focusing on the
rich analogies between this theory and the classical computation of the Gaussian integral.
The main common features that underlie these analogies may be summarized as follows:
· the introduction of two mutually alien copies of the object of interest;
· the computation of the eﬀect — i.e., on the two mutually alien copies of the object of
interest — of two-dimensional changes of coordinates by considering the eﬀect
on inﬁnitesimals;
· the passage from planar cartesian to polar coordinates and the resulting splitting, or decoupling, into radial — i.e., in more abstract valuation-theoretic terminology, “value group” — and angular — i.e., in more abstract valuation-theoretic
terminology, “unit group” — portions;
· the straightforward evaluation of the radial portion by applying the quadraticity
of the exponent of the Gaussian distribution;
· the straightforward evaluation of the angular portion by considering the metric geometry of the group of units determined by a suitable version of the natural
logarithm function.
[Here, the intended sense of the descriptive “alien” is that of its original Latin root, i.e., a
sense of abstract, tautological “otherness”.] After reviewing the classical computation
of the Gaussian integral, we give a detailed survey of inter-universal Teichmüller theory by
concentrating on the common features listed above. The paper concludes with a discussion
of various historical aspects of the mathematics that appears in inter-universal Teichmüller
theory.

Introduction
In the present paper, we survey inter-universal Teichmüller theory by focusing
on the rich analogies [cf. §3.8] between this theory and the classical computation of the
Gaussian integral. Inter-universal Teichmüller theory concerns the construction of
canonical deformations of the ring structure of a number ﬁeld
equipped with certain auxiliary data. The collection of data, i.e., consisting of the
number ﬁeld equipped with certain auxiliary data, to which inter-universal Teichmüller
theory is applied is referred to as initial Θ-data [cf. §3.3, (i), for more details]. The
principal components of a collection of initial Θ-data are
· the given number ﬁeld,
· an elliptic curve over the number ﬁeld, and
· a prime number l ≥ 5.
The main applications of inter-universal Teichmüller theory to diophantine geometry [cf. §3.7, (iv), for more details] are obtained by applying the canonical deformation
constructed for a speciﬁc collection of initial Θ-data to bound the height of the elliptic
curve that appears in the initial Θ-data.
Let N be a ﬁxed natural number > 1. Then the issue of bounding a given nonnegative real number h ∈ R≥0 may be understood as the issue of showing that N · h is
roughly equal to h, i.e.,
N · h “≈” h
[cf. §2.3, §2.4]. When h is the height of an elliptic curve over a number ﬁeld, this
issue may be understood as the issue of showing that the height of the [in fact, in most
cases, ﬁctional!] “elliptic curve” whose q-parameters are the N -th powers “q N ” of the
q-parameters “q” of the given elliptic curve is roughly equal to the height of the
given elliptic curve, i.e., that, at least from the point of view of [global] heights,
qN

“≈” q

[cf. §2.3, §2.4].
In order to verify the approximate relation q N “≈” q, one begins by introducing
two distinct — i.e., two “mutually alien” — copies of the conventional scheme

theory surrounding the given initial Θ-data. Here, the intended sense of the descriptive
“alien” is that of its original Latin root, i.e., a sense of
abstract, tautological “otherness”.
These two mutually alien copies of conventional scheme theory are glued together
— by considering relatively weak underlying structures of the respective conventional
scheme theories such as multiplicative monoids and proﬁnite groups — in such a
way that the “q N ” in one copy of scheme theory is identiﬁed with the “q” in the other
copy of scheme theory. This gluing is referred to as the Θ-link. Thus, the “q N ” on the
left-hand side of the Θ-link is glued to the “q” on the right-hand side of the Θ-link, i.e.,
N
qLHS

“=”

qRHS

[cf. §3.3, (vii), for more details]. Here, “N ” is in fact taken not to be a ﬁxed natural
number, but rather a sort of symmetrized average over the values j 2 , where j =
def
1, . . . , l , and we write l = (l − 1)/2. Thus, the left-hand side of the above display
2

j
{qLHS
}j

bears a striking formal resemblance to the Gaussian distribution. One then veriﬁes
the desired approximate relation q N “≈” q by computing
2

j
{qLHS
}j

— not in terms of qLHS [which is immediate from the deﬁnitions!], but rather — in
terms of [the scheme theory surrounding]
qRHS
[which is a highly nontrivial matter!]. The conclusion of this computation may be summarized as follows:
up to relatively mild indeterminacies — i.e., “relatively small error terms”

and hence of the desired bounds on heights is an essentially formal matter [cf. §3.7,
(ii), (iv); §3.11, (iv), (v)].
The starting point of the exposition of the present paper lies in the observation [cf.
§3.8 for more details] that the main features of the theory underlying the computation

just discussed of {qLHS

In passing, we mention that yet another brief overview of certain important aspects of
inter-universal Teichmüller theory from a very elementary point of view may be found
in §3.11.
The present paper begins, in §1, with a review of the classical computation of the
Gaussian integral, by breaking down this familiar computation into steps in such a
way as to facilitate the subsequent comparison with inter-universal Teichmüller theory.
We then proceed, in §2, to discuss the portion of inter-universal Teichmüller theory
mf
that corresponds to (2 ). The exposition of §2 was designed so as to be accessible
to readers familiar with well-known portions of scheme theory and the theory of the
étale fundamental group — i.e., at the level of [Harts] and [SGA1]. The various
Examples that appear in this exposition of §2 include numerous
well-deﬁned and relatively straightforward mathematical assertions

Shinichi Mochizuki

often without complete proofs. In particular, the reader may think of the task of
supplying a complete proof for any of these assertions as a sort of “exercise” and hence
of §2 itself as a sort of
workbook with exercises.
At the level of papers, §2 is concerned mainly with the content of the “classical” paper [Uchi] of Uchida and the “preparatory papers” [FrdI], [FrdII], [GenEll], [AbsTopI],
[AbsTopII], [AbsTopIII]. By contrast, the level of exposition of §3 is substantially less
elementary than that of §2. In §3, we apply the conceptual infrastructure exposed
in §2 to survey those aspects of inter-universal Teichmüller theory that correspond to
mf
mf

(1 ), (3 ), (4 ), and (5 ), i.e., at the level of papers, to [EtTh], [IUTchI], [IUTchII],

theory exposed in §2 and §3.

Review of the computation of the Gaussian integral

Inter-universal Teichmüller theory via the Gaussian integral

The goal of the present paper is to pave the road, for the reader, from a state of
complete ignorance of inter-universal Teichmüller theory to a state of general appreciation of the “game plan” of inter-universal Teichmüller theory by reconsidering
the well-known computation of the Gaussian integral

via polar coordinates from the point of view of a hypothetical high-school student who
has studied one-variable calculus and polar coordinates, but has not yet had any exposure to multi-variable calculus. That is to say, we shall begin in the present §1

by reviewing this computation of the Gaussian integral by discussing how this computation might be explained to such a hypothetical high-school student. In subsequent
§’s, we then proceed to discuss how various key steps in such an explanation to a
hypothetical high-school student may be translated into the more sophisticated language of abstract arithmetic geometry in such a way as to yield a general outline
of inter-universal Teichmüller theory based on the deep structural similarities between
inter-universal Teichmüller theory and the computation of the Gaussian integral.
§ 1.2.

Naive approach via changes of coordinates or partial integrations

In one-variable calculus, deﬁnite integrals that appear intractable at ﬁrst glance
are often reduced to much simpler deﬁnite integrals by performing suitable changes of
coordinates or partial integrations. Thus:

perform a change of coordinates

— only to realize shortly afterwards that this computation is in error, on account
of the erroneous treatment of the inﬁnitesimal “dx” when the change of
coordinates was executed.
Step 2: This realization might then lead the student to attempt to repair the
computation of Step 1 by considering various iterated partial integrations

§ 1.3.

Introduction of identical but mutually alien copies

At this point, one might suggest to the hypothetical high-school student the idea
of computing the Gaussian integral by ﬁrst squaring the integral and then taking the
square root of the value of the square of the integral. That is to say, in eﬀect:
Step 3: One might suggest to the hypothetical high-school student that the
Gaussian integral can in fact be computed by considering the product of two

— i.e., as opposed to a single copy of the Gaussian integral.
Here, let us recall that our hypothetical high-school student was already in a mental state
of extreme frustration as a result of the student’s intensive and heroic attempts in Step
2 which led only to an endless labyrinth of meaningless and increasingly complicated
mathematical expressions. This experience left our hypothetical high-school student
with the impression that the Gaussian integral was without question by far the most
diﬃcult integral that the student had ever encountered. In light of this experience,
the suggestion of Step 3 evoked a reaction of intense indignation and distrust on the
part of the student. That is to say,
the idea that meaningful progress could be made in the computation of such
an exceedingly diﬃcult integral simply by considering two identical copies of
the integral — i.e., as opposed to a single copy — struck the student as being
utterly ludicrous.
Put another way, the suggestion of Step 3 was simply not the sort of suggestion that the
student wanted to hear. Rather, the student was keenly interested in seeing some sort of
clever partial integration or change of coordinates involving “sin(−)”, “cos(−)”,
1
“tan(−)”, “exp(−)”, “ 1+x
2 ”, etc., i.e., of the sort that the student was used to seeing
in familiar expositions of one-variable calculus.
§ 1.4.

Integrals over two-dimensional Euclidean space

Only after quite substantial eﬀorts at persuasion did our hypothetical high-school
student reluctantly agree to proceed to the next step of the explanation:
Step 4: If one considers the “totality”, or “total space”, of the coordinates
that appear in the product of two copies of the Gaussian integral of Step 3,
then one can regard this product of integrals as a single integral

over the Euclidean plane R2 .
Of course, our hypothetical high-school student might have some trouble with Step
4 since it requires one to assimilate the notion of an integral over a space, i.e., the
Euclidean plane R2 , which is not an interval of the real line. This, however, may be
explained by reviewing the essential philosophy behind the notion of the Riemann
integral — a philosophy which should be familiar from one-variable calculus:

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

Step 5: One may think of integrals over more general spaces, i.e., such as the
Euclidean plane R2 , as computations

net mass = lim
(inﬁnitesimals of zero mass)
of “net mass” by considering limits of sums of inﬁnitesimals, i.e., such as
“dx dy”, which one may think of as having “zero mass”.
§ 1.5.

The eﬀect on inﬁnitesimals of changes of coordinates

Just as in one-variable calculus, computations of integrals over more general spaces
can often be simpliﬁed by performing suitable changes of coordinates. Any [say, continuously diﬀerentiable] change of coordinates results in a new factor, given by the
Jacobian, in the integrand. This factor constituted by the Jacobian, i.e., the determinant of a certain matrix of partial derivatives, may appear to be somewhat mysterious to
our hypothetical high-school student, who is only familiar with changes of coordinates
in one-variable calculus. On the other hand, the appearance of the Jacobian may be
justiﬁed in a computational fashion as follows:
Step 6: Let U, V ⊆ R2 be open subsets of R2 and
U  (s, t) → (x, y) = (f (s, t), g(s, t)) ∈ V
a continuously diﬀerentiable change of coordinates such that the Jacobian
⎞
⎛
∂f ∂f

∂s ∂t
⎠
J = det ⎝
def

∂g ∂g
∂s ∂t

— which may be thought of as a continuous real-valued function on U — is
nonzero throughout U . Then for any continuous real-valued functions φ : U →
R, ψ : V → R such that ψ(f (s, t), g(s, t)) = φ(s, t), the eﬀect of the above
change of coordinates on the integral of ψ over V may be computed as follows:


ψ dx dy =
φ · J ds dt.
V

U

Step 7: In the situation of Step 6, the eﬀect of the change of coordinates on
the “inﬁnitesimals” dx dy and ds dt may be understood as follows: First, one
localizes to a suﬃciently small open neighborhood of a point of U over which
the various partial derivatives of f and g are roughly constant, which implies
that the change of coordinates determined by f and g is roughly linear. Then
the eﬀect of such a linear transformation on areas — i.e., in the language of Step
5, “masses” — of suﬃciently small parallelograms is given by multiplying

Shinichi Mochizuki

10

by the determinant of the linear transformation. Indeed, to verify this, one
observes that, after possible pre- and post-composition with a rotation [which
clearly does not aﬀect the computation of such areas], one may assume that one
of the sides of the parallelogram under consideration is a line segment on the
s-axis whose left-hand endpoint is equal to the origin (0, 0), and, moreover, that
the linear transformation may be written as a composite of toral dilations and
unipotent linear transformations of the form
(s, t) → (a · s, b · t);

(s, t) → (s + c · t, t)

— where a, b, c ∈ R, and ab = 0. On the other hand, in the case of such “upper
triangular” linear transformations, the eﬀect of the linear transformation on
the area of the parallelogram under consideration is an easy computation at the
level of high-school planar geometry.
§ 1.6.

Passage from planar cartesian to polar coordinates

Once the “innocuous” generalities of Steps 5, 6, and 7 have been assimilated, one
may proceed as follows:
Step 8: We apply Step 6 to the integral of Step 4, regarded as an integral over
the complement R2 \ (R≤0 × {0}) of the negative x-axis in the Euclidean plane,
and the change of coordinates
R>0 × (−π, π)  (r, θ) → (x, y) = (r cos(θ), r sin(θ)) ∈ R2 \ (R≤0 × {0})
— where we write R>0 for the set of positive real numbers and (−π, π) for the
open interval of real numbers between −π and π.
Step 9: The change of coordinates of Step 8 allows one to compute as follows:

the computation of the integral under consideration, the radial [i.e., “r”] and
angular [i.e., “θ”] coordinates may be decoupled, i.e., that the integral under
consideration may be written as a product of a radial integral and an angular
integral.

the above evaluation of the angular integral may be regarded as arising from
the change of coordinates given by considering the imaginary part of the
natural logarithm
log(r · eiθ ) = log(r) + iθ.

it is essentially a hopeless task to identify “explicit portions” of
2

this original Gaussian integral −∞ e−x dx on the real line that
“correspond” precisely, in some sort of meaningful sense, to the
radial and angular integrals of Steps 10 and 11.
§ 1.7.

Justiﬁcation of naive approach up to an “error factor”

Put another way, the content of the above discussion may be summarized as follows:
If one considers two identical — but mutually independent! — copies
of the Gaussian integral, i.e., as opposed to a single copy, then the naively
motivated coordinate transformation that gave rise to the erroneous com√
putation of Step 1 may be “justiﬁed”, up to a suitable “error factor” π!
In this context, it is of interest to note that the technique applied in the above discussion
2
for evaluating the integral of the Gaussian distribution “e−x ” cannot, in essence, be
applied to integrals of functions other than the Gaussian distribution. Indeed,
this essentially unique relationship between the technique of the above discussion and
the Gaussian distribution may be understood as being, in essence, a consequence of the
fact that the exponential function determines an isomorphism of Lie groups between
the “additive Lie group” of real numbers and the “multiplicative Lie group” of positive
real numbers. We refer to [Bell], [Dawson] for more details.

Changes of universe as arithmetic changes of coordinates

The issue of bounding heights: the ABC and Szpiro Conjectures

In diophantine geometry, i.e., more speciﬁcally, the diophantine geometry of rational points of an algebraic curve over a number ﬁeld [i.e., an “NF”], one is
typically concerned with the issue of bounding heights of such rational points. A
brief exposition of various conjectures related to this issue of bounding heights of rational points may be found in [Fsk], §1.3. In this context, the case where the algebraic
curve under consideration is the projective line minus three points corresponds most
directly to the so-called ABC and — by thinking of this projective line as the “λ-line”
that appears in discussions of the Legendre form of the Weierstrass equation for an
elliptic curve — Szpiro Conjectures. In this case, the height of a rational point may
be thought of as a suitable weighted sum of the valuations of the q-parameters of
the elliptic curve determined by the rational point at the nonarchimedean primes of potentially multiplicative reduction [cf. the discussion at the end of [Fsk], §2.2; [GenEll],
Proposition 3.4]. Here, it is also useful to recall [cf. [GenEll], Theorem 2.1] that, in the

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

13

situation of the ABC or Szpiro Conjectures, one may assume, without loss of generality,
that, for any given ﬁnite set Σ of [archimedean and nonarchimedean] valuations of the
rational number ﬁeld Q,
the rational points under consideration lie, at each valuation of Σ, inside some
compact subset [i.e., of the set of rational points of the projective line minus
three points over some ﬁnite extension of the completion of Q at this valuation]
satisfying certain properties.
In particular, when one computes the height of a rational point of the projective line
minus three points as a suitable weighted sum of the valuations of the q-parameters of
the corresponding elliptic curve, one may ignore, up to bounded discrepancies, contributions to the height that arise, say, from the archimedean valuations or from the
nonarchimedean valuations that lie over some “exceptional” prime number such as 2.
§ 2.2.

Arithmetic degrees as global integrals

As is well-known, the height of a rational point may be thought of as the arithmetic degree of a certain arithmetic line bundle over the ﬁeld of deﬁnition of the
rational point [cf. [Fsk], §1.3; [GenEll], §1]. Alternatively, from an idèlic point of view,
such arithmetic degrees of arithmetic line bundles over an NF may be thought of as
logarithms of volumes — i.e., “log-volumes” — of certain regions inside the ring of
adèles of the NF [cf. [Fsk], §2.2; [AbsTopIII], Deﬁnition 5.9, (iii); [IUTchIII], Proposition 3.9, (iii)]. Relative to the point of view of the discussion of §1.4, such log-volumes
may be thought of as “net masses”, that is to say,
as “global masses” [i.e., global log-volumes] that arise by summing up various
“local masses” [i.e., local log-volumes], corresponding to the [archimedean and
nonarchimedean] valuations of the NF under consideration.
This point of view of the discussion of §1.4 suggests further that such a global net mass
should be regarded as some sort of
integral over an NF, that is to say, which arises by applying some sort of
mysterious “limit summation operation” to some sort of “zero mass
inﬁnitesimal” object [i.e., corresponding to a diﬀerential form].
It is precisely this point of view that will be pursued in the discussion to follow via the
following correspondences with terminology to be explained below:
zero mass objects

“étale-like” structures

positive/nonzero mass objects

“Frobenius-like”structures

§ 2.3.

Bounding heights via global multiplicative subspaces

In the situation discussed in §2.1, one way to understand the problem of showing
that the height h ∈ R of a rational point is “small” is as the problem of showing that,
for some ﬁxed natural number N > 1, the height h satisﬁes the equation


def
N · h = h + h + ... + h = h
[which implies that h = 0!] — or, more generally, for a suitable “relatively small”
constant C ∈ R [i.e., which is independent of the rational point under consideration],
the inequality
N ·h ≤ h+C
[which implies that h ≤ N 1−1 · C!] — holds. Indeed, this is precisely the approach that
is taken to bounding heights in the “tiny” special case of the theory of [Falt1] that is
given in the proof of [GenEll], Lemma 3.5. Here, we recall that the key assumption in
[GenEll], Lemma 3.5, that makes this sort of argument work is the assumption of the
existence, for some prime number l, of a certain kind of special rank one subspace [i.e.,
a subspace whose Fl -dimension is equal to 1] of the space of l-torsion points [i.e., a Fl vector space of dimension 2] of the elliptic curve under consideration. Such a rank one
subspace is typically referred to in this context as a global multiplicative subspace,
i.e., since it is a subspace deﬁned over the NF under consideration that coincides, at
each nonarchimedean valuation of the NF at which the elliptic curve under consideration
has potentially multiplicative reduction, with the rank one subspace of l-torsion points
that arises, via the Tate uniformization, from the [one-dimensional] space of l-torsion
points of the multiplicative group Gm . The quotient of the original given elliptic curve
by such a global multiplicative subspace is an elliptic curve that is isogenous to the
original elliptic curve. Moreover,
the q-parameters of this isogenous elliptic curve are the l-th powers of the
q-parameters of the original elliptic curve; thus, the height of this isogenous
elliptic curve is [roughly, up to contributions of negligible order] l times the
height of the original elliptic curve.
These properties of the isogenous elliptic curve allow one to compute the height of the
isogenous elliptic curve in terms of the height of the original elliptic curve by calculating
the eﬀect of the isogeny relating the two elliptic curves on the respective sheaves of
diﬀerentials and hence to conclude an inequality “N · h ≤ h + C” of the desired type
[for N = l — cf. the proof of [GenEll], Lemma 3.5, for more details]. At a more concrete
level, this computation may be summarized as the observation that, by considering the
eﬀect of the isogeny under consideration on sheaves of diﬀerentials, one may conclude
that

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

15

multiplying heights by l — i.e., “raising q-parameters to the l-th power”
q → q l
— has the eﬀect on logarithmic diﬀerential forms
d log(q) = dq
q → l · d log(q)
of multiplying by l, i.e., at the level of heights, of adding terms of the order
of log(l), thus giving rise to inequalities that are roughly of the form “l · h ≤
h + log(l)”.
On the other hand, in general,
such a global multiplicative subspace does not exist, and the issue of somehow
“simulating” the existence of a global multiplicative subspace is one fundamental theme of inter-universal Teichmüller theory.
§ 2.4.

Bounding heights via Frobenius morphisms on number ﬁelds

The simulation issue discussed in §2.3 is, in some sense, the fundamental reason for
the construction of various types of “Hodge theaters” in [IUTchI] [cf. the discussion
surrounding [IUTchI], Fig. I1.4; [IUTchI], Remark 4.3.1]. From the point of view of the
present discussion, the fundamental additive and multiplicative symmetries that
appear in the theory of [Θ±ell N F -]Hodge theaters [cf. §3.3, (v); §3.6, (i), below] and
which correspond, respectively, to the additive and multiplicative structures of the ring
Fl [where l is the ﬁxed prime number for which we consider l-torsion points], may be
thought of as corresponding, respectively, to the symmetries in the equation


def
N · h = h + h + ... + h = h
of all the h’s [in the case of the additive symmetry] and of the h’s on the LHS [in
the case of the multiplicative symmetry]. This portion of inter-universal Teichmüller
theory is closely related to the analogy between inter-universal Teichmüller theory and
the classical hyperbolic geometry of the upper half-plane. This analogy with
the hyperbolic geometry of the upper half-plane is, in some sense, the central topic
of [BogIUT] [cf. also §3.10, (vi); §4.1, (i); §4.3, (iii), of the present paper] and may
be thought of as corresponding to the portion of inter-universal Teichmüller theory
discussed in [IUTchI], [IUTchIII]. Since this aspect of inter-universal Teichmüller theory
is already discussed in substantial detail in [BogIUT], we shall not discuss it in much
detail in the present paper. On the other hand, another way of thinking about the
above equation “N · h = h” is as follows:
This equation may also be thought of as calling for the establishment of some
sort of analogue for an NF of the Frobenius morphism in positive characteristic scheme theory, i.e., a Frobenius morphism that somehow “acts” naturally

Shinichi Mochizuki

16

on the entire situation [i.e., including the height h, as well as the q-parameters
at nonarchimedean valuations of potentially multiplicative reduction, of a given
elliptic curve over the NF] in such a way as to multiply arithmetic degrees [such
as the height!] by N and raise q-parameters to the N -th power — i.e.,
h → N · h,

q → q N

— and hence yield the equation “N · h = h” [or inequality “N · h ≤ h + C”] via
some sort of natural functoriality.
This point of view is also quite fundamental to inter-universal Teichmüller theory,
and, in particular, to the analogy between inter-universal Teichmüller theory and the
theory of the Gaussian integral, as reviewed in §1. These aspects of inter-universal
Teichmüller theory are discussed in [IUTchII], [IUTchIII]. In the present paper, we shall
concentrate mainly on the exposition of these aspects of inter-universal Teichmüller
theory. Before proceeding, we remark that, ultimately, in inter-universal Teichmüller
theory, we will, in eﬀect, take “N ” to be a sort of symmetrized average over the
def
squares of the values j = 1, 2, . . . , l , where l = (l − 1)/2, and l is the prime
number of §2.3. That is to say, whereas the [purely hypothetical!] naive analogue of
the Frobenius morphism for an NF considered so far has the eﬀect, on q-parameters
of the elliptic curve under consideration at nonarchimedean valuations of potentially
multiplicative reduction, of mapping q → q N , the sort of assignment that we shall
ultimately be interested in in inter-universal Teichmüller theory is an assignment [which
is in fact typically written with the left- and right- hand sides reversed]
2

q → {q j }j=1,...,l
— where q denotes a 2l-th root of the q-parameter q — i.e., an assignment which, at
least at a formal level, closely resembles a Gaussian distribution. Of course, such an
assignment is not compatible with the ring structure of an NF, hence does not exist
in the framework of conventional scheme theory. Thus, one way to understand
inter-universal Teichmüller theory is as follows:
in some sense the fundamental theme of inter-universal Teichmüller theory consists of the development of a mechanism for computing the eﬀect — e.g., on
heights of elliptic curves [cf. the discussion of §2.3!] — of such non-schemetheoretic “Gaussian Frobenius morphisms” on NF’s.
§ 2.5.

Fundamental example of the derivative of a Frobenius lifting

In some sense, the most fundamental example of the sort of Frobenius action in
the p-adic theory that one would like to somehow translate into the case of NF’s is the
following [cf. [AbsTopII], Remark 2.6.2; [AbsTopIII], §I5; [IUTchIII], Remark 3.12.4,
(v)]:

Example 2.5.1.
Frobenius liftings on smooth proper curves. Let p be
a prime number; A the ring of Witt vectors of a perfect ﬁeld k of characteristic p;
X a smooth, proper curve over A of genus gX ≥ 2; Φ : X → X a Frobenius lifting,
i.e., a morphism whose reduction modulo p coincides with the Frobenius morphism in
characteristic p. Thus, one veriﬁes immediately that Φ necessarily lies over the Frobenius
morphism on the ring of Witt vectors A. Write ωXk for the sheaf of diﬀerentials of
def

Xk = X ×A k over k. Then the derivative of Φ yields, upon dividing by p, a morphism
of line bundles
Φ ∗ ωXk → ωX k
which is easily veriﬁed to be generically injective. Thus, by taking global degrees of line
bundles, we obtain an inequality
(p − 1)(2gX − 2) ≤ 0
— hence, in particular, an inequality gX ≤ 1 — which may be thought of as being, in
essence, a statement to the eﬀect that X cannot be hyperbolic. Note that, from the
point of view discussed in §1.4, §1.5, §2.2, §2.3, §2.4, this inequality may be thought of
as
a computation of “global net masses”, i.e., global degrees of line bundles on
Xk , via a computation of the eﬀect of the “change of coordinates” Φ by
considering the eﬀect of this change of coordinates on “inﬁnitesimals”, i.e.,
on the sheaf of diﬀerentials ωXk .
§ 2.6.

Positive characteristic model for mono-anabelian transport

One fundamental drawback of the computation discussed in Example 2.5.1 is that
it involves the operation of diﬀerentiation on Xk , an operation which does not, at
least in the immediate literal sense, have a natural analogue in the case of NF’s. This
drawback does not exist in the following example, which treats certain subtle, but wellknown aspects of anabelian geometry in positive characteristic and, moreover,
may, in some sense, be regarded as the fundamental model, or prototype, for a
quite substantial portion of inter-universal Teichmüller theory. In this example, Galois
groups, or étale fundamental groups, in some sense play the role that is played
by tangent bundles in the classical theory — a situation that is reminiscent of the
approach of the [scheme-theoretic] Hodge-Arakelov theory of [HASurI], [HASurII],
which is brieﬂy reviewed in §2.14 below. One notion of central importance in this
example — and indeed throughout inter-universal Teichmüller theory! — is the notion
of a cyclotome, a term which is used to refer to an isomorphic copy of some quotient
[by a closed submodule] of the familiar Galois module “Z(1)”, i.e., the “Tate twist” of

Shinichi Mochizuki

18

the trivial Galois module “Z”, or, alternatively, the rank one free Z-module equipped
with the action determined by the cyclotomic character. Also, if p is a prime number,
then we shall write Z=p for the quotient Z/Zp .
Example 2.6.1.
Mono-anabelian transport via the Frobenius morphism

ΦηX : ηX → ηX

for the respective Frobenius morphisms of X, ηX , ηX . Thus, we have natural surjections GK  ΠX  Gk , and ΠX may be thought of as [i.e., is naturally isomorphic to] the étale fundamental group of X [for a suitable choice of basepoint]. Write
def
ΔX = Ker(ΠX  Gk ). Recall that it follows from elementary facts concerning separable and purely inseparable ﬁeld extensions that [by considering ΦηX ] ΦηX induces
isomorphisms of Galois groups and étale fundamental groups
∼

ΨX : ΠX → ΠX ,

ΨηX : GK → GK

— which is, in some sense, a quite remarkable fact since
the Frobenius morphisms ΦX , ΦηX themselves are morphisms “of degree
p > 1”, hence, in particular, are by no means isomorphisms!
We refer to [IUTchIV], Example 3.6, for a more general version of this phenomenon.
(ii) Next, let us recall that it follows from the fundamental anabelian results of
[Uchi] that there exists a purely group-theoretic functorial algorithm
GK → K(GK )CFT  GK
— i.e., an algorithm whose input data is the abstract topological group GK , whose
functoriality is with respect to isomorphisms of topological groups, and whose output
data is a ﬁeld K(GK )CFT equipped with a GK -action. Moreover, if one allows oneself
to apply the conventional interpretation of GK as a Galois group Gal(K/K), then there
is a natural GK -equivariant isomorphism

that arises from the reciprocity map of class ﬁeld theory, applied to each of the
ﬁnite subextensions of the extension K/K. Since class ﬁeld theory depends, in an
essential way, on the ﬁeld structure of K and K, it follows formally that, at least in
an a priori sense, the construction of ρ itself also depends, in an essential way, on the
ﬁeld structure of K and K. Moreover, the fact that the isomorphism K(ΨηX )CFT :

K(GK )CFT → K(GK )CFT and ρ are [unlike ΦηX itself!] isomorphisms implies that the

[i.e., such as μk =p , MX ] will be referred to as a cyclotomic rigidity isomorphism. Thus,
if we let “H” range over the open subgroups of GK , then, by composing this cyclotomic

reconstructed group-theoretically from the abstract topological group GK . Moreover,
the anabelian theory of [Cusp] [cf., especially, [Cusp], Proposition 2.1; [Cusp], Theorem
2.1, (ii); [Cusp], Theorem 3.2] yields a purely group-theoretic functorial algorithm
GK → K(GK )Kum  GK

functoriality is with respect to isomorphisms of topological groups, and whose output
data is a ﬁeld K(GK )Kum equipped with a GK -action which is constructed as the union

with {0} of the image of κ. [In fact, the input data for this algorithm may be taken
to be the abstract topological group ΠX , but we shall not pursue this topic here.]
Thus, just as in the case of “K(−)CFT ”, the fact that the isomorphism K(ΨηX )Kum :

K(GK )Kum → K(GK )Kum and κ are [unlike ΦηX itself!] isomorphisms implies that the

(iv) The [a priori] noncommutativity of the diagram of the ﬁnal display of (iii) may
be interpreted in two ways, as follows:
(a) If one starts with the assumption that this diagram is in fact commutative, then the
fact that the Frobenius morphism Φ∗ηX multiplies degrees of rational functions ∈ K
by p, together with the fact that the vertical and upper horizontal arrows of the
diagram are isomorphisms, imply [since the ﬁeld K is not perfect!] the erroneous
conclusion that all degrees of rational functions ∈ K are equal to zero! This sort of
argument is formally similar to the argument “N · h = h =⇒ h = 0” discussed
in §2.3.
(b) One may regard the noncommutativity of this diagram as the problem of computing just how much “indeterminacy” one must allow in the objects and arrows
that appear in the diagram in order to render the diagram commutative. From
this point of view, one veriﬁes immediately that a solution to this problem may
be given by introducing “indeterminacies” as follows: One replaces
λ  λ · pZ
the cyclotomic rigidity isomorphism λ by the orbit of λ with respect to composition with multiplication by arbitrary Z-powers of p, and one replaces
K  K pf ,

K(GK )Kum  (K(GK )Kum )pf

the ﬁelds K, K(GK )Kum by their perfections.
Here, we observe that intepretation (b) may be regarded as corresponding to the argument “N · h ≤ h + C =⇒ h ≤ N 1−1 · C” discussed in §2.3. That is to say,
If, in the situation of (b), one can show that the indeterminacies necessary to
render the diagram commutative are suﬃciently mild, at least in the case

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

21

of the heights or q-parameters that one is interested in, then it is “reasonable
to expect” that the resulting “contradiction in the style of interpretation (a)”
between
multiplying degrees by some integer [or rational number] > 1
and the fact that
the vertical and upper horizontal arrows of the diagram
are isomorphisms
should enable one to conclude that “N · h ≤ h + C” [and hence that “h ≤
1
N −1 · C”].
This is precisely the approach that is in fact taken in inter-universal Teichmüller theory.
§ 2.7.

The apparatus and terminology of mono-anabelian transport

Example 2.6.1 is exceptionally rich in structural similarities to inter-universal
Teichmüller theory, which we proceed to explain in detail as follows. One way to understand these structural similarities is by considering the quite substantial portion of
terminology of inter-universal Teichmüller theory that was, in essence, inspired by
Example 2.6.1:
(i) Links between “mutually alien” copies of scheme theory: One central
aspect of inter-universal Teichmüller theory is the study of certain “walls”, or “ﬁlters”
— which are often referred to as “links” — that separate two “mutually alien”
copies of conventional scheme theory [cf. the discussions of [IUTchII], Remark
3.6.2; [IUTchIV], Remark 3.6.1]. The main example of such a link in inter-universal
Teichmüller theory is constituted by [various versions of] the Θ-link. The log-link also
plays an important role in inter-universal Teichmüller theory. The main motivating
example for these links which play a central role in inter-universal Teichmüller theory
is the Frobenius morphism ΦηX of Example 2.6.1. From the point of view of the
discussion of §1.4, §1.5, §2.2, §2.3, §2.4, and §2.5, such a link corresponds to a change
of coordinates.
(ii) Frobenius-like objects: The objects that appear on either side of a link
and which are used in order to construct, or “set up”, the link, are referred to as
“Frobenius-like”. Put another way,
Frobenius-like objects are objects that, at least a priori, are only deﬁned on
one side of a link [i.e., either the domain or codomain], and, in particular, do
not necessarily map isomorphically to corresponding objects on the opposite
side of the link.

22

Shinichi Mochizuki

Thus, in Example 2.6.1, the “mutually alien” copies of K on either side of the ppower map Φ∗ηX are Frobenius-like. Typically, Frobenius-like structures are characterized
by the fact that they have positive/nonzero mass. That is to say, Frobenius-like
structures represent the positive mass — i.e., such as degrees of rational functions in
Example 2.6.1 or heights/degrees of arithmetic line bundles in the context of diophantine
geometry — that one is ultimately interested in computing and, moreover, is, at least
in an a priori sense, aﬀected in a nontrivial way, e.g., multiplied by some factor > 1,
by the link under consideration. From this point of view, Frobenius-like objects are
characterized by the fact that the link under consideration gives rise to an “ordering”,
or “asymmetry”, between Frobenius-like objects in the domain and codomain of the
link under consideration [cf. the discussion of [FrdI], §I3, §I4].
(iii) Étale-like objects: By contrast, objects that appear on either side of a link
that correspond to the “topology of some sort of underlying space” — such as the étale
topology! — are referred to as “étale-like”. Typically, étale-like structures are mapped
isomorphically — albeit via some indeterminate isomorphism! [cf. the discussion of
§2.10 below] — to one another by the link under consideration. From this point of
view, étale-like objects are characterized by the fact that the link under consideration
gives rise to a “confusion”, or “symmetry”, between étale-like objects in the domain
and codomain of the link under consideration [cf. the discussion of [FrdI], §I3, §I4].
Thus, in Example 2.6.1, the Galois groups/étale fundamental groups GK , ΠX , which
are mapped isomorphically to one another via ΦηX , albeit via some “mysterious indeterminate isomorphism”, are étale-like. Objects that are algorithmically constructed
from étale-like objects such as GK or ΠX are also referred to as étale-like, so long
as they are regarded as being equipped with the additional structure constituted by
the algorithm applied to construct the object from some object such as GK or ΠX .
Étale-like structures are regarded as having zero mass and are used as rigid containers for positive mass Frobenius-like objects, i.e., containers whose structure satisﬁes
certain rigidity properties that typically arise from various anabelian properties and
[as in Example 2.6.1!] allows one to compute the eﬀect on positive mass Frobenius-like
objects of the links, or “changes of coordinates”, under consideration.
(iv) Coric objects: In the context of consideration of some sort of link as in (i),
coricity refers to the property of being invariant with respect to — i.e., the property of
mapping isomorphically to a corresponding object on the opposite side of — the
link under consideration. Thus, as discussed in (iii), étale-like objects, considered up
to isomorphism, constitute a primary example of the notion of a coric object. On the
other hand, [non-étale-like] Frobenius-like coric objects also arise naturally in various
contexts. Indeed, in the situation of Example 2.6.1 [cf. the discussion of Example
2.6.1, (iv), (b)], not only étale-like objects such as ΠX , GK , and K(GK )Kum , but also

Fig. 2.1: Mono-anabelian transport
Frobenius-like objects such as the perfections K pf are coric.
(v) The computational technique of mono-anabelian transport: The technique discussed in (iii), i.e., of
computing the eﬀect on positive mass Frobenius-like objects of the links,
or “changes of coordinates”, under consideration, by ﬁrst applying some sort of
Kummer isomorphism to pass from Frobenius-like to corresponding étalelike objects, then applying some sort of anabelian construction algorithm or
rigidity property, and ﬁnally applying a suitable inverse Kummer isomorphism to pass from étale-like to corresponding Frobenius-like objects
will be referred to as the technique of mono-anabelian transport [cf. Fig. 2.1 above].
In some sense, the most fundamental prototype for this technique is the situation
described in Example 2.6.1, (iii) [cf. also the discussion of Example 2.6.1, (iv), (b)].
Here, the term “mono-anabelian” [cf. the discussion of [AbsTopIII], §I2] refers to the
fact that the algorithm under consideration is an algorithm whose input data [typically]
consists only of an abstract proﬁnite group [i.e., that “just happens” to be isomorphic
to a Galois group or étale fundamental group that arises from scheme theory!]. This
term is used to distinguish from fully faithfulness results [i.e., to the eﬀect that one has
a natural bijection between certain types of morphisms of schemes and certain types of
morphisms of proﬁnite groups] of the sort that appear in various anabelian conjectures
of Grothendieck. Such fully faithfulness results are referred to as “bi-anabelian”.
(vi) Kummer-detachment indeterminacies versus étale-transport indeterminacies: The ﬁrst step that occurs in the procedure for mono-anabelian transport
[cf. the discussion of (v)] is the passage, via some sort of Kummer isomorphism, from
Frobenius-like objects to corresponding étale-like objects. This ﬁrst step is referred to
as Kummer-detachment. The indeterminacies that arise during this ﬁrst step are referred to as Kummer-detachment indeterminacies [cf. [IUTchIII], Remark 1.5.4].

Shinichi Mochizuki

24

Such Kummer-detachment indeterminacies typically involve indeterminacies in the cyclotomic rigidity isomorphism that is applied, i.e., as in the situation discussed in
Example 2.6.1, (iv), (b). On the other hand, in general, more complicated Kummerdetachment indeterminacies [i.e., that are not directly related to cyclotomic rigidity
isomorphisms] can occur. By contrast, the indeterminacies that occur as a result of the
fact that the étale-like structures under consideration may only be regarded as being
known up to an indeterminate isomorphism [cf. the discussion of (iii), as well as of §2.10
below] are referred to as étale-transport indeterminacies [cf. [IUTchIII], Remark
1.5.4].
(vii) Arithmetic holomorphic structures versus mono-analytic structures:
A ring may be regarded as consisting of “two combinatorial dimensions” — namely,
the underlying additive and multiplicative structures of the ring — which are intertwined with one another in a rather complicated fashion [cf. the discussion of
[AbsTopIII], §I3; [AbsTopIII], Remark 5.6.1]. In inter-universal Teichmüller theory, one
is interested in dismantling this complicated intertwining structure by considering the
underlying additive and multiplicative monoids associated to a ring separately. In
this context, the ring structure, as well as other structures such as étale fundamental groups that are suﬃciently rigid as to allow the algorithmic reconstruction of the
ring structure, are referred to as arithmetic holomorphic structures. By contrast,
structures that arise from dismantling the complicated intertwining inherent in a ring
structure are referred to as mono-analytic — a term which may be thought of as a
sort of arithmetic analogue of the notion of an underlying real analytic structure in the
context of complex holomorphic structures. From this point of view, the approach of
Example 2.6.1, (ii), involving the reciprocity map of class ﬁeld theory depends on
the arithmetic holomorphic structure [i.e., the ring structure] of the ﬁeld K in a
quite essential and complicated way. By contrast, the Kummer-theoretic approach
of Example 2.6.1, (iii), only depends on the mono-analytic structure constituted by
the underlying multiplicative monoid of the ﬁeld K, together with the cyclotomic
rigidity isomorphism λ. Thus, although λ depends on the ring structure of the ﬁeld
K, the Kummer-theoretic approach of Example 2.6.1, (iii), has the advantage, from the
point of view of dismantling the arithmetic holomorphic structure, of
isolating the dependence of κ on the arithmetic holomorphic structure of the
ﬁeld K in the “compact form” constituted by the cyclotomic rigidity isomorphism λ.
§ 2.8.

Remark on the usage of certain terminology

In the context of the discussion of §2.7, we remark that although terms such as
“link”, “Frobenius-like”, “étale-like”, “coric”, “mono-anabelian transport”, “Kummer-

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

25

detachment”, “cyclotomic rigidity isomorphism”, “mono-analytic”, and “arithmetic holomorphic structure” are
well-deﬁned in the various speciﬁc contexts in which they are applied, these
terms do not admit general deﬁnitions that are applicable in all contexts.
In this sense, such terms are used in a way that is similar to the way in which terms
such as “underlying” [cf., e.g., the “underlying topological space of a scheme”, the
“underlying real analytic manifold of a complex manifold”] or “anabelian” are typically
used in mathematical discussions. The term “multiradial”, which will be discussed in
§3, is also used in this way. In this context, we remark that one aspect that complicates
the use of the terms “Frobenius-like” and “étale-like” is the sort of curious process
of evolution that these terms underwent as the author progressed from writing [FrdI],
[FrdII] in 2005 to writing [IUTchI] in 2008 and ﬁnally to writing [IUTchII] and [IUTchIII]
during the years 2009 - 2010. This “curious process of evolution” may be summarized
as follows:
(1

Fr/ét

(2

Fr/ét

) Vague philosophical approach [i.e., “order-conscious” vs. “indifferent to order”]: The ﬁrst stage in this evolutionary process consists of the
vague philosophical characterizations of the notion of “Frobenius-like” via the term
“order-conscious” and of the notion of “étale-like” via the phrase “indiﬀerent to
order”. These vague characterizations were motivated by the situation surrounding the monoids [i.e., in the case of “Frobenius-like”] that appear in the theory of Frobenioids [cf. [FrdI], [FrdII]] and the situation surrounding the Galois
groups/arithmetic fundamental groups [i.e., in the case of “étale-like”] that
appear in the base categories [“D”] of Frobenioids. This point of view is discussed
in [FrdI], §I4, and is quoted and applied throughout [IUTchI].

) Characterization in the context of the log-theta-lattice: This point of
view consists of the characterization of the notions of “Frobenius-like” and “étalelike” in the context of the speciﬁc links, i.e., the Θ- and log-links, that occur in the
log-theta-lattice. This approach is developed throughout [IUTchII] [cf., especially,
[IUTchII], Remark 3.6.2] and [IUTchIII] [cf., especially, [IUTchIII], Remark 1.5.4].
Related discussions may be found in [IUTchIV], Remarks 3.6.2, 3.6.3. At a purely
technical/notational level, this approach may be understood as follows [cf. also the
discussion in the ﬁnal portion of §3.3, (vii), of the present paper]:
· Frobenius-like objects [or structures] are objects that, when embedded in the logtheta-lattice, are marked [via left-hand superscripts] by lattice coordinates “(n, m)”
or, when not embedded in the log-theta-lattice, are marked [via left-hand superscripts] by daggers “†”/double daggers “‡”/asterisks “∗”.

26

· étale-like objects [or structures] are objects that arise from [i.e., are often denoted as “functions (−)” of] the D/D -portions of the Θ±ell N F -Hodge theaters
that appear, or, when embedded in the log-theta-lattice, are marked [via left-hand
superscripts] by vertically coric/bi-coric lattice coordinates “(n, ◦)”/“(◦, ◦)”.
(3

Fr/ét

) Abstract link-theoretic approach: This is the the approach taken in §2.7 of
the present paper. In this approach, the notions of “Frobenius-like” and “étale-like”
are only deﬁned in the context of a speciﬁc link. This approach arose, in discussions involving the author and Y. Hoshi, as a sort of abstraction/generalization
of the situation that occurs in [IUTchII], [IUTchIII] in the case of the speciﬁc links,

)].
i.e., the Θ- and log-links, that occur in the case of the log-theta-lattice [cf. (2

Thus, of these three approaches (1
), (2
), (3
), the approach (3
) is, in
some sense, theoretically the most satisfying approach, especially from the point of view
of considering possible generalizations of the theory of [IUTchI], [IUTchII], [IUTchIII],
[IUTchIV]. On the other hand, from the point of view of the more restricted goal
of attaining a technically sound understanding of the content of [IUTchI], [IUTchII],

[IUTchIII], [IUTchIV], the purely technical/notational approach discussed in (2
quite suﬃcient.
§ 2.9.

Mono-anabelian transport and the Kodaira-Spencer morphism

The discussion of §2.6 and §2.7 may be summarized as follows: In some sense, the
central theme of inter-universal Teichmüller theory is the computation via monoanabelian transport — in the spirit of the discussion of Example 2.6.1, (iv), (b) —
of the discrepancy between two [systems of] Kummer theories, that is to say,
of the sort of indeterminacies that one must admit in order to render two
systems of Kummer theories compatible — i.e., relative to the various gluings
constituted by some link [cf. the Frobenius morphism ΦηX in Example 2.6.1;
the discussion of §2.7, (i)] between the two systems of Kummer theories —
with simultaneous execution, e.g., when one of the two systems of Kummer
theories [cf. the objects in the lower right-hand corner of the diagram of §2.6,
(iii), and Fig. 2.1] is held ﬁxed.
In this context, it is of interest to observe that this approach of computing degrees
of [“positive mass”] Frobenius-like objects by embedding them into rigid étale-like
[“zero mass”] containers [cf. the discussion of §2.7, (iii), (v)] is formally similar to
the classical deﬁnition of the Kodaira-Spencer morphism associated to a family of
elliptic curves [cf. also the discussion of §3.1, (v), below]: Indeed, suppose [relative to
the terminology of [Semi], §0] that S log is a smooth log curve over Spec(C) [equipped
with the trivial log structure], and that E log → S log is a stable log curve of type (1, 1)

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

27

[i.e., in essence, a family of elliptic curves whose origin is regarded as a “marked point”,
and which is assumed to have stable reduction at the points of degeneration]. Write
ωS log /C for the sheaf of relative logarithmic diﬀerentials of S log → Spec(C); (E, ∇E :
E → E ⊗OS ωS log /C ) for the rank two vector bundle with logarithmic connection on S log
determined by the ﬁrst logarithmic de Rham cohomology module of E log → S log and the
logarithmic Gauss-Manin connection; ωE ⊆ E for the Hodge ﬁltration on E; τE for the
OS -dual of ωE . Thus, we have a natural exact sequence 0 → ωE → E → τE → 0. Then
the Kodaira-Spencer morphism associated to the family E log → S log may be deﬁned as
the composite of morphisms in the diagram

— where the left-hand vertical arrow is the natural inclusion, and the right-hand vertical arrow is the natural surjection. The three arrows in this diagram may be regarded
as corresponding to the three arrows in analogous positions in the diagrams of Example
2.6.1, (iii), and Fig. 2.1. That is to say, this diagram may be understood as a computation of the degree deg(−) of the “positive mass” Frobenius-like object ωE that yields
an inequality deg(ωE ) ≤ deg(ωS log /C ) − deg(ωE ), i.e.,
2 · deg(ωE ) ≤ deg(ωS log /C )
via a comparison of “alien copies” of the “positive mass” Frobenius-like object
ωE that lie on opposite sides of the “link” constituted by a deformation of the moduli/holomorphic structure of the family of elliptic curves under consideration. This
comparison is performed by relating these Frobenius-like objects ωE [or its dual] on
either side of the deformation by means of the “zero mass” étale-like object (E, ∇E ),
i.e., which may be thought of as a local system on the open subscheme US ⊆ S of
the underlying scheme S of S log where the log structure of S log is trivial. The tensor
product with ωS log /C — and the resulting appearance of the bound deg(ωS log /C ) in the
above inequality — may be understood as the indeterminacy that one must admit in
order to achieve this comparison.
§ 2.10.

Inter-universality: changes of universe as changes of coordinates

One fundamental aspect of the links [cf. the discussion of §2.7, (i)] — namely, the
Θ-link and log-link — that occur in inter-universal Teichmüller theory is their incompatibility with the ring structures of the rings and schemes that appear in their
domains and codomains. In particular, when one considers the result of transporting
an étale-like structure such as a Galois group [or étale fundamental group] across such

28

Shinichi Mochizuki

a link [cf. the discussion of §2.7, (iii)], one must abandon the interpretation of such
a Galois group as a group of automorphisms of some ring [or ﬁeld] structure [cf.
[AbsTopIII], Remark 3.7.7, (i); [IUTchIV], Remarks 3.6.2, 3.6.3], i.e., one must regard
such a Galois group as an abstract topological group that is not equipped with any
of the “labelling structures” that arise from the relationship between the Galois group
and various scheme-theoretic objects. It is precisely this state of aﬀairs that results in
the quite central role played in inter-universal Teichmüller theory by results in
[mono-]anabelian geometry, i.e., by results concerned with reconstructing
various scheme-theoretic structures from an abstract topological group that “just
happens” to arise from scheme theory as a Galois group/étale fundamental
group.
In this context, we remark that it is also this state of aﬀairs that gave rise to the term
“inter-universal”: That is to say, the notion of a “universe”, as well as the use of
multiple universes within the discussion of a single set-up in arithmetic geometry, already
occurs in the mathematics of the 1960’s, i.e., in the mathematics of Galois categories
and étale topoi associated to schemes. On the other hand, in this mathematics of the
Grothendieck school, typically one only considers relationships between universes — i.e.,
between labelling apparatuses for sets — that are induced by morphisms of schemes, i.e.,
in essence by ring homomorphisms. The most typical example of this sort of situation
is the functor between Galois categories of étale coverings induced by a morphism of
connected schemes. By contrast, the links that occur in inter-universal Teichmüller
theory are constructed by partially dismantling the ring structures of the rings in their
domains and codomains [cf. the discussion of §2.7, (vii)], hence necessarily result in
much more complicated relationships between the universes — i.e., between the labelling apparatuses for sets — that are adopted in the Galois categories that occur in the domains and codomains of these links, i.e., relationships that do not respect the various labelling apparatuses for sets that arise
from correspondences between the Galois groups that appear and the respective
ring/scheme theories that occur in the domains and codomains of the links.
That is to say, it is precisely this sort of situation that is referred to by the term
“inter-universal”. Put another way,
a change of universe may be thought of [cf. the discussion of §2.7, (i)] as
a sort of abstract/combinatorial/arithmetic version of the classical notion
of a “change of coordinates”.
In this context, it is perhaps of interest to observe that, from a purely classical point of
view, the notion of a [physical] “universe” was typically visualized as a copy of Euclidean
three-space. Thus, from this classical point of view,

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

29

a “change of universe” literally corresponds to a “classical change of the coordinate system — i.e., the labelling apparatus — applied to label points in
Euclidean three-space”!
Indeed, from an even more elementary point of view, perhaps the simplest example of the
essential phenomenon under consideration here is the following purely combinatorial
phenomenon: Consider the string of symbols
010
— i.e., where “0” and “1” are to be understood as formal symbols. Then, from the
point of view of the length two substring 01 on the left, the digit “1” of this substring
may be speciﬁed by means of its “coordinate relative to this substring”, namely, as the
symbol to the far right of the substring 01. In a similar vein, from the point of view of
the length two substring 10 on the right, the digit “1” of this substring may be speciﬁed
by means of its “coordinate relative to this substring”, namely, as the symbol to the far
left of the substring 10. On the other hand,
neither of these speciﬁcations via “substring-based coordinate systems”
is meaningful to the opposite length two substring; that is to say, only the
solitary abstract symbol “1” is simultaneously meaningful, as a device
for specifying the digit of interest, relative to both of the “substring-based
coordinate systems”.
Finally, in passing, we note that this discussion applies, albeit in perhaps a somewhat
∼
trivial way, to the isomorphism of Galois groups ΨηX : GK → GK induced by the
Frobenius morphism ΦηX in Example 2.6.1, (i): That is to say, from the point of view
of classical ring theory, this isomorphism of Galois groups is easily seen to coincide with
the identity automorphism of GK . On the other hand, if one takes the point of view
that elements of various subquotients of GK are equipped with labels that arise from
the isomorphisms ρ or κ of Example 2.6.1, (ii), (iii), i.e., from the reciprocity map of
class ﬁeld theory or Kummer theory, then one must regard such labelling apparatuses
as being incompatible with the Frobenius morphism ΦηX . Thus, from this point
of view, the isomorphism ΦηX must be regarded as a “mysterious, indeterminate
isomorphism” [cf. the discussion of §2.7, (iii)].
§ 2.11.

The two underlying combinatorial dimensions of a ring

Before proceeding, we pause to examine in more detail the two underlying combinatorial dimensions of a ring discussed in §2.7, (vii) [cf. also [AbsTopIII], §I3].
One way of expressing these two underlying combinatorial dimensions of a ring — i.e.,
constituted by addition and multiplication — is by means of semi-direct product

Shinichi Mochizuki

30

groups such as
Zl  Z×
l

or Fl  F×
l

— where l is a prime number; Zl denotes, by abuse of notation, the underlying additive
proﬁnite group of the ring “Zl ” of l-adic integers; Z×
l denotes the multiplicative proﬁnite
group of invertible l-adic integers; Fl , by abuse of notation, denotes the underlying
additive group of the ﬁnite ﬁeld “Fl ” of l elements; F×
l denotes the multiplicative group
×
×
of the ﬁeld Fl ; Zl , Fl act on Zl , Fl via the ring structure of Zl , Fl . Here, we note
that both [the rings] Zl and Fl are closely related to the fundamental ring Z. Indeed, Z
may be regarded as a dense subring of Zl , while Fl may be regarded as a “good ﬁnite
discrete approximation” of Z whenever l is “large” by comparison to the numbers
def
of interest. Note, moreover, that if Gk = Gal(k/k) is the absolute Galois group of a
mixed-characteristic local ﬁeld [i.e., “MLF”] k of residue characteristic p for which
k is an algebraic closure, then the maximal tame quotient Gk  Gtm
k is isomorphic to
some open subgroup of the closed subgroup of the direct product

of the closed subgroup topologically generated by the image of p [cf. [NSW], Proposition
7.5.1]. Thus, if we assume that p = l, then l may be thought of as one of the “l ’s” in
the last two displays. In particular, from a purely cohomological point of view, the two
×
combinatorial dimensions “Zl ” and “Z×
l ” of the semi-direct product group Zl  Zl
— i.e., which correspond to the additive and multiplicative structures of the ring Zl —
may be thought of as corresponding directly to the two l-cohomological dimensions [cf.
[NSW], Theorem 7.1.8, (i)] of the proﬁnite group Gtm
k or, equivalently [since l = p],
of the proﬁnite group Gk . This suggests the point of view that the “restriction to l”
should not be regarded as essential, i.e., that one should regard
the two underlying combinatorial dimensions of the ring k as corresponding to the two cohomological dimensions of its absolute Galois group
Gk ,
and indeed, more generally, since the two cohomological dimensions of the absolute
Galois group GF of a [say, for simplicity, totally imaginary] number ﬁeld F [cf. [NSW],
Proposition 8.3.17] may be thought of, via the well-known classical theory of the Brauer
group, as globalizations [cf. [NSW], Corollary 8.1.16; [NSW], Theorem 8.1.17] of the
two cohomological dimensions of the absolute Galois groups of its [say, for simplicity,
nonarchimedean] localizations, that one should regard

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

31

the two underlying combinatorial dimensions of a [totally imaginary]
number ﬁeld F as corresponding to the two cohomological dimensions
of its absolute Galois group GF .
Moreover, in the case of the local ﬁeld k, the two cohomological dimensions of Gk may
be thought of as arising [cf., e.g., the proof of [NSW], Theorem 7.1.8, (i)] from the one
(∼
cohomological dimension of the maximal unramiﬁed quotient Gk  Gunr
= Z) and the
k
def
one cohomological dimension of the inertia subgroup Ik = Ker(Gk  Gunr
k ). Since Ik
unr
and Gk may be thought of as corresponding, via local class ﬁeld theory [cf. [NSW],
Theorem 7.2.3], or, alternatively [i.e., “dually” — cf. [NSW], Theorem 7.2.6], via Kummer theory, to the subquotients of the multiplicative group k × associated to k given
by the unit group Ok× and the value group k × /Ok× of k [together with the corresponding
subquotients associated to the various subextensions of k in k], we conclude that it is
natural to regard
the two underlying combinatorial dimensions of the ring k, or, alternatively, the
two cohomological dimensions of its absolute Galois group Gk , as corresponding
to the natural exact sequence
1 → Ok× → k × → k × /Ok× → 1
— i.e., to the [non-split, i.e., at least when subject to the requirement of functoriality with respect to the operation of passing to ﬁnite extensions of k!]
“decomposition” of k × into its unit group Ok× and value group k × /Ok× .
This situation is reminiscent of the [split!] decomposition of the multiplicative topological group C× associated to the ﬁeld of complex numbers, i.e., which is equipped with
a natural decomposition
∼
C× → S1 × R>0
as a direct product of its unit group S1 and value group R>0 [i.e., the multiplicative
group of positive real numbers].
§ 2.12.

Mono-anabelian transport for mixed-characteristic local ﬁelds

The discussion of the two underlying combinatorial dimensions of a ring in §2.11
— especially, in the case of an MLF “k”— leads naturally, from the point of view of the
analogy discussed in §2.2, §2.3, §2.4, §2.5, and §2.7 with the classical theory of §1.4 and
§1.5, to consideration of the following examples, which may be thought of as arithmetic
analogues of the discussion in Step 7 of §1.5 of the eﬀect of upper triangular linear
transformations and rotations on “local masses”. As one might expect from the
discussion of §2.7, Kummer theory — i.e., applied to relate Frobenius-like structures

Shinichi Mochizuki

32

to their étale-like counterparts — and cyclotomic rigidity isomorphisms play a
central role in these examples. In the following examples, we use the notation of §2.11
for “k” and various objects related to k; also, we shall write
(Ok× ⊆)

Ok

(⊆ k × )

for the topological multiplicative monoid of nonzero integral elements of k,
μk

⊆

Ok

for the topological module of torsion elements of Ok , and
∼

ρk : k × → (k × )∧ → Gab
k
for the composite of the embedding of k × into its proﬁnite completion (k × )∧ with the
natural isomorphism [i.e., which arises from local class ﬁeld theory] of (k × )∧ with the
abelianization Gab
k of Gk . Here, we recall, from local class ﬁeld theory, that ρk is
functorial with respect to passage to ﬁnite subextensions of k in k and the Verlagerung
homomorphism between abelianizations of open subgroups of Gk . Also, we recall [cf.,
e.g., [AbsAnab], Proposition 1.2.1, (iii), (iv)] that the images ρk (μk ) ⊆ ρk (Ok ) ⊆

×
via ρk may be constructed group-theoretically
ρk (k × ) ⊆ Gab
k of μk , Ok , and k
from the topological group Gk . The notation introduced so far for various objects
related to k will also be applied to ﬁnite subextensions of k in k, as well as [i.e., by
passing to suitable inductive limits] to k itself. In particular, if we write
μk (Gk )

for the respective inductive systems [or, by abuse of notation, when there is no fear of
confusion, inductive limits], relative to the Verlagerung homomorphism between abelianizations of open subgroups of Gk , of the [group-theoretically constructible!] submonoids

Example 2.12.1.
Nonarchimedean multiplicative monoids of local integers.
(i) In the following, we wish to regard the pair “Gk  Ok ” as an abstract indtopological monoid “Ok ” [i.e., inductive system of topological monoids] equipped with

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

33

a continuous action by an abstract topological group “Gk ”. Thus, for instance, we may
×
think of k as the groupiﬁcation (Ok )gp of the monoid Ok , of μk as the subgroup of
torsion elements of the monoid Ok , and of Ok ⊆ k × as the result of considering the Gk ×

×

invariants (Ok )Gk ⊆ (k )Gk of the inclusion Ok ⊆ k . Observe that, by considering
the action of Gk on the various N -th roots, for N a positive integer, of elements of k × ,
we obtain a natural Kummer map

κk : k × → H 1 (Gk , μkZ )
— which may be composed with the natural isomorphism ρμk to obtain a natural embedding

: k × → H 1 (Gk , μkZ (Gk ))
κGal
k
— where we note that the cohomology module in the codomain of this embedding
may be constructed group-theoretically from the abstract topological group “Gk ”.
On the other hand, it follows immediately from the deﬁnitions that κk may be constructed functorially from the abstract ind-topological monoid with continuous topological group action “Gk  Ok ”.
(ii) In fact,
ρμk may also be constructed functorially from the abstract ind-topological
monoid with continuous topological group action “Gk  Ok ”.
Indeed, this follows formally from the fact that
∼

there exists a canonical isomorphism Q/Z → H 2 (Gk , μk ) that may be
constructed functorially from this data “Gk  Ok ”.
— i.e., by applying this functorial construction to both the data “Gk  Ok ” and the
data “Gk  Ok (Gk )” and then observing that ρμk may be characterized as the unique
∼

∼

isomorphism μk → μk (Gk ) that is compatible with the isomorphisms Q/Z → H 2 (Gk , μk )
∼
and Q/Z → H 2 (Gk , μk (Gk )). To construct this canonical isomorphism [cf., e.g., the
proof of [AbsAnab], Proposition 1.2.1, (vii); the statement and proof of [FrdII], Theorem 2.4, (ii); the statement of [AbsTopIII], Corollary 1.10, (i), (a); the statement of
×
[AbsTopIII], Proposition 3.2, (i), for more details], we ﬁrst observe that since k /μk is a
×
∼
Q-vector space, it follows that we have natural isomorphisms H 2 (Gk , μk ) → H 2 (Gk , k ),
×
∼
H 2 (Ik , μk ) → H 2 (Ik , k ). Since, moreover, the inertia subgroup Ik ⊆ Gk is of co×
homological dimension 1 [cf. the discussion of §2.11], we conclude that H 2 (Ik , k )
∼
→ H 2 (Ik , μk ) = 0. Next, let us recall that, by elementary Galois theory [i.e., “Hilbert’s
×
Theorem 90”], one knows that H 1 (Ik , k ) = 0. Thus, we conclude from the Leray→ 1 that,
Serre spectral sequence associated to the extension 1 → Ik → Gk → Gunr

if we write k unr ⊆ k for the subﬁeld of Ik -invariants of k, then we have a natural iso×

morphism H 2 (Gk , k ) → H 2 (Gunr
k , (k

) ) → H 2 (Gunr
on (k ) determines an isomorphism H 2 (Gunr
k , (k
k , Z) [where again
we apply “Hilbert’s Theorem 90”, this time to the residue ﬁeld of k]. Moreover, by
∼
→ Z [which is
applying the isomorphism determined by the Frobenius element Gunr
k
group-theoretically constructible — cf. [AbsAnab], Proposition 1.2.1, (iv)], together
with the long exact sequence in Galois cohomology associated to the short exact sequence 0 → Z → Q → Q/Z → 0 [and the fact that Q is a Q-vector space!], we obtain
∼
∼
1
unr
a natural isomorphism H 2 (Gunr
k , Z) → H (Gk , Q/Z) → Hom(Z, Q/Z) = Q/Z. Thus,
by taking the inverse of the composite of the various natural isomorphisms constructed
so far [solely from the data “Gk  Ok ”!], we obtain the desired canonical isomorphism
∼

Q/Z → H 2 (Gk , μk ).

(iii) The functorial construction given in (ii) — i.e., via well-known elementary
techniques involving Brauer groups of the sort that appear in local class ﬁeld theory
— of the cyclotomic rigidity isomorphism ρμk from the data “Gk  Ok ” is perhaps
the most fundamental case — at least in the context of the arithmetic of NF’s and
MLF’s — of the phenomenon of cyclotomic rigidity. One formal consequence of the
discussion of (i), (ii) is the fact that the operation of passing from the data “Gk  Ok ”
to the data “Gk ” is fully faithful, i.e., one has a natural bijection
Aut(Gk  Ok )

— where the ﬁrst “Aut(−)” denotes automorphisms of the data “Gk  Ok ” consisting of an abstract ind-topological monoid with continuous topological group action; the
second “Aut(−)” denotes automorphisms of the data “Gk ” consisting of an abstract
topological group [cf. [AbsTopIII], Proposition 3.2, (iv)]. Indeed, surjectivity follows formally from the functorial construction of the data “Gk  Ok (Gk )” from the abstract
topological group Gk [cf. the discussion at the beginning of the present §2.12]; injectivity
follows formally from the fact that, as a consequence of the cyclotomic rigidity discussed
in (ii), one has a functorial construction from the data “Gk  Ok ” of the embedding

constructed solely from the abstract topological group Gk !]. Note that this situation may
also be understood in terms of the general framework of mono-anabelian transport
discussed in §2.7, (v) [cf. also Example 2.6.1, (iii), (iv)], by considering the commutative

rigidity discussed in (ii) may be understood, relative to the exact sequence

×
×
×
around the rigidity of the two fundamental subquotients μk ⊆ k and k  k /Ok×
×

of k . When viewed in this light, the discussion of the present Example 2.12.1 may be
thought of, relative to the analogy discussed in §2.2, §2.3, §2.4, §2.5, and §2.7 with the
classical theory of §1.4 and §1.5, as corresponding to the discussion of the eﬀect on “local masses” of the unipotent linear transformations that appeared in the discussion
of Step 7 of §1.5.
(iv) At this point, it is perhaps of interest to observe that there is an alternative approach to constructing the cyclotomic rigidity isomorphism ρμk . That is to say, instead
of reasoning as in (ii), one may reason as follows. First, we observe that, by applying
the functorial construction of (ii) in the case of the data “Gk  Ok (Gk )”, one obtains
∼



a canonical isomorphism Q/Z → H 2 (Gk , μkZ (Gk )). Since the cup product in group cohomology, together with this canonical isomorphism, determines a perfect duality [cf.
∼

Z
1
[NSW], Theorem 7.2.6], one thus obtains a natural isomorphism Gab
k → H (Gk , μk (Gk )).
Write

Ok (Gk )Kum ⊆ H 1 (Gk , μkZ (Gk ))

for the image via this natural isomorphism of Ok (Gk ) ⊆ Gab
k [i.e., the submodule of


Kum
may be constructed group-theoretically
Gk -invariants of Ok (Gk )]. Thus, Ok (Gk )
from the abstract topological group Gk . Next, let us recall the elementary fact that,
relative to the natural inclusion Q → Z ⊗ Q, we have an equality

Z× = {1}
Q>0
— where Q>0 ⊆ Q denotes the multiplicative monoid of positive rational numbers.
Now let us observe that it follows formally from this elementary fact — for instance, by
considering the quotient Ok (Gk )  Ok (Gk )/Ok× (Gk ) (∼
= N) by the submonoid of units
×

×
Ok (Gk ) ⊆ Ok (Gk ) — that the only element ∈ Z that, relative to the natural action of

Z× on H 1 (Gk , μkZ (Gk )) [i.e., induced by the natural action of Z× on μk (Gk )], preserves
the submonoid Ok (Gk ) is the identity element 1 ∈ Z× . In particular, it follows that
the cyclotomic rigidity isomorphism ρμk may be characterized as the unique
∼
isomorphism μk → μk (Gk ) that is compatible with the submonoids κk (Ok ) ⊆


H 1 (Gk , μkZ ) and Ok (Gk )Kum ⊆ H 1 (Gk , μkZ (Gk )).

This characterization thus yields an alternative approach to the characterization of the
cyclotomic rigidity isomorphism ρμk given in (ii) [cf. the discussion of [IUTchIII], Remark 2.3.3, (viii)]. On the other hand, there is a fundamental diﬀerence between
this alternative approach and the approach of (ii): Indeed, one veriﬁes immediately that
the approach of (ii) is compatible with the proﬁnite topology of Gk in the sense
that the construction of (ii) may be formulated as the result of applying a suitable limit
operation to “ﬁnite versions” of this construction of (ii), i.e., versions in which “Gk ” is
replaced by the quotients of “Gk ” by suﬃciently small normal open subgroups of “Gk ”,
and “Ok ” is replaced by the submonoids of invariants with respect to such normal
open subgroups. By contrast, the alternative approach just discussed is fundamentally incompatible with the proﬁnite topology of Gk in the sense that the crucial fact
 ×
Z = {1} — which may be thought of as a sort of discreteness property [cf.
Q>0
the discussion of [IUTchIII], Remark 3.12.1, (iii); [IUTchIV], Remark 2.3.3, (ii)] — may
only be applied at the level of the full proﬁnite group Gk [i.e., at the level of Kummer
classes with coeﬃcients in some copy of Z(1)], not at the level of ﬁnite quotients of Gk
[i.e., at the level of Kummer classes with coeﬃcients in some ﬁnite quotient of some copy
of Z(1)]. Thus, in summary, although this alternative approach has the disadvantage
of being incompatible with the proﬁnite topology of Gk , various versions of this
approach — i.e., involving constructions that depend, in an essential way, on the crucial
 ×
Z = {1} — will, nevertheless, play an important role in inter-universal
fact Q>0
Teichmüller theory [cf. the discussion of Example 2.13.1 below].

Example 2.12.2.
Frobenius morphisms on nonarchimedean multiplicative monoids of local integers.
(i) One way to gain a further appreciation of the cyclotomic rigidity phenomenon
discussed in Example 2.12.1 is to consider the pair “Gk  Ok× ”, which again we regard as consisting of an abstract ind-topological monoid “Ok× ” [i.e., inductive system of
topological monoids] equipped with a continuous action by an abstract topological group
“Gk ”. Since Ok× may be thought of as an inductive system/limit of proﬁnite abelian

groups, it follows immediately that there is a natural Gk -equivariant action of Z× on the
data “Gk  Ok× ”. Moreover, if α is an arbitrary automorphism of this data “Gk  Ok× ”
[i.e., regarded as an abstract ind-topological monoid equipped with a continuous action
by an abstract topological group], then although it is not necessarily the case that α is
∼
compatible with the cyclotomic rigidity isomorphism ρμk : μk → μk (Gk ), one veriﬁes
immediately [from the fact that, as an abstract abelian group, μk ∼
= Q/Z, together with
×
the elementary fact that Aut(Q/Z) = Z ] that there always exists a unique element
λ ∈ Z× such that the automorphism λ · α of the data “Gk  Ok× ” is compatible with
ρμk . Thus, by arguing as in Example 2.12.1, (iii), one concludes that one has a natural

topological group [cf. [AbsTopIII], Proposition 3.3, (ii); [FrdII], Remark 2.4.2]. Just as
in the case of Example 2.12.1, (iii), this situation may also be understood in terms of
the general framework of mono-anabelian transport discussed in §2.7, (v) [cf. also
Example 2.6.1, (iii), (iv)], by considering the commutative diagram

the action of a suitable element ∈ Z× .

(ii) Let πk ∈ Ok be a uniformizer of Ok . Then one sort of intermediate type of data
between the data “Gk  Ok× ” considered in (i) above and the data “Gk  Ok ” considered in Example 2.12.1 is the data “Gk  Ok× · Ok (⊆ Ok )”, which again we regard
as consisting of an abstract ind-topological monoid “Ok× · Ok ” [i.e., inductive system of
topological monoids] equipped with a continuous action by an abstract topological group
“Gk ”. Here, we observe that Ok× · Ok = Ok× · πkN . Let Z  N ≥ 2, α ∈ Aut(Gk  Ok× ).
Then observe that N , α determine — i.e., in the spirit of the discussion of §2.4 — a

diagonal nature of the action of φN,α on the unit group Ok× [via α] and the value
group πkZ [by raising to the N -th power] portions of the ind-topological monoid Ok× ·Ok
may be thought of, relative to the analogy discussed in §2.2, §2.3, §2.4, §2.5, and §2.7
with the classical theory of §1.4 and §1.5, as corresponding to the discussion of the eﬀect
on “local masses” of the toral dilations that appeared in the discussion of Step 7 of
§1.5.
Example 2.12.3.
Nonarchimedean logarithms.
(i) The discussion of various simple cases of mono-anabelian transport in Examples
2.12.1, (iii); 2.12.2, (i), (ii), concentrated on the Kummer-theoretic aspects, i.e., in eﬀect,
on the Kummer-detachment indeterminacies [cf. §2.7, (vi)], or lack thereof, of the
examples considered. On the other hand, another fundamental aspect of these examples
[cf. the natural bijections of Examples 2.12.1, (iii); 2.12.2, (i)] is the étale-transport
indeterminacies [cf. §2.7, (vi)] that occur as a result of the well-known
existence of elements ∈ Aut(Gk ) that do not preserve the ring structure on
[the union with {0} of] Ok (Gk )
— cf. [NSW], the Closing Remark preceding Theorem 12.2.7. By contrast, if X is
a hyperbolic curve of strictly Belyi type [cf. [AbsTopII], Deﬁnition 3.5] over
k, and we write ΠX for the étale fundamental group of X [for a suitable choice of
basepoint], then it follows from the theory of [AbsTopIII], §1 [cf. [AbsTopIII], Theorem
1.9; [AbsTopIII], Remark 1.9.2; [AbsTopIII], Corollary 1.10], that
if one regards Gk as a quotient ΠX  Gk of ΠX , then there exists a functorial
algorithm for reconstructing this quotient ΠX  Gk of ΠX , together with the
ring structure on [the union with {0} of] Ok (Gk ), from the abstract topological
group ΠX .
Here, we recall that [it follows immediately from the deﬁnitions that] any connected
ﬁnite étale covering of a once-punctured elliptic curve [i.e., an elliptic curve minus
the origin] over k that is deﬁned over an NF is necessarily of strictly Belyi type.
(ii) Write (Ok× )pf for the perfection [cf., e.g., [FrdI], §0] of the ind-topological monoid
Ok× . Thus, it follows immediately from the elementary theory of p-adic ﬁelds [cf., e.g.,
[Kobl], Chapter IV, §1, §2] that the p-adic logarithm determines a Gk -equivariant
bijection

— where the “. . .” on the left and right denote the result of juxtaposing copies of the
portion of the diagram “from Ok to Ok ”, i.e., copies that are glued together along the
initial/ﬁnal instances of “Ok ”. Here, we observe that the various objects that appear in
this diagram may be regarded as being equipped with a natural action of ΠX [for X
as in (i)], which acts via the natural quotient ΠX  Gk . To keep the notation simple,
we shall denote the portion of the diagram “from Ok to Ok ” by means of the notation
log : Ok → Ok . Thus, the diagram of the above display may be written

— i.e., regarded as a sequence of iterates of “log”. Here, since the operation “log” [i.e.,
which, in eﬀect, converts “” into “”] is incompatible with the ring structures
on [the union with {0} of] the copies of Ok in the domain and codomain of “log”, we
observe — in accordance with the discussion of §2.10! — that it is natural to regard the
∼
various copies of Ok as being equipped with distinct labels and the isomorphisms “ → ”
between diﬀerent copies of ΠX as being indeterminate isomorphisms between distinct abstract topological groups. Such diagrams are studied in detail in [AbsTopIII], and,
moreover, form the fundamental model for the log-link of inter-universal Teichmüller
theory [cf. §3.3, (ii), (vi), below], which is studied in detail in [IUTchIII].
(iii) It follows from the mono-anabelian theory of [AbsTopIII], §1 [cf. [AbsTopIII],
Theorem 1.9; [AbsTopIII], Corollary 1.10], that, if we regard Gk as a quotient of ΠX ,

[cf.
then the image, which we denote by Ok (ΠX ) (⊆ H 1 (Gk , μkZ (Gk ))), of Ok via κGal
k
Example 2.12.1, (iii)] may be reconstructed — i.e., as a topological monoid equipped
with a ring structure [on its union with {0}] — from the abstract topological group
ΠX . By applying this construction to arbitrary open subgroups of Gk and passing to
inductive systems/limits, we thus obtain an ind-topological monoid Ok (ΠX ) equipped
with a natural continuous action by ΠX and a ring structure [on its union with {0}].
Thus, from the point of view of the general framework of mono-anabelian transport

ΠX → ΠX [cf. the discussion of §2.10]; the lower horizontal arrow is the operation “log”
discussed in (ii); the vertical arrows are the “Kummer isomorphisms” determined
by the various “κGal
k ” associated to open subgroups of Gk ; the “. . .” denote iterates
of the square surrounding the “ ?”. Thus, the vertical arrows of this diagram relate
the various copies of Frobenius-like data Ok to the various copies of étale-like data
Ok (ΠX ), which are coric [cf. the discussion of §2.7, (iv)] with respect to the “link”
constituted by the operation log.
(iv) The diagram of (iii) is, of course, far from being commutative [cf. the
notation “ ?”], i.e., at least at the level of images of elements via the various composites
of arrows in the diagram. On the other hand, if, instead of considering such images of
elements via composites of arrows in the diagram, one considers regions [i.e., subsets]
of [the union with {0} of the groupiﬁcation of] Ok (⊆ Ok ) or Ok (ΠX ) (⊆ Ok (ΠX )),
then one veriﬁes easily that the following observation holds:
Write
I = (2p)−1 · logk (Ok× ) ⊆ k = {0} ∪ (Ok )gp
def

and I(ΠX ) ⊆ {0} ∪ Ok (ΠX )gp for the corresponding subset of the union with
{0} of the groupiﬁcation of Ok (ΠX ). Then we have inclusions of “regions”
Ok ⊆ I ⊇ logk (Ok× )
within I, as well as corresponding inclusions for I(ΠX ).
The compact “region” I, which is referred to as the log-shell, plays an important role
in inter-universal Teichmüller theory. Note that one has both Frobenius-like [i.e., I]
and étale-like [i.e., I(ΠX )] versions of the log-shell. Here, we observe that, from the
point of view of the discussion of arithmetic holomorphic structures in §2.7, (vii),
both of these versions are holomorphic in the sense that they depend, at least in an a
priori sense, on “logk ”, i.e., which is deﬁned in terms of a power series that only makes
sense if one is equipped with both “” and “” [i.e., both the additive and multiplicative
structures of the ring k]. On the other hand, if one writes
“O×μ ”

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

41

for the quotient of “O× ” by its torsion subgroup [i.e., by the roots of unity], then logk
determines natural bijections of topological modules
∼

Ok×μ ⊗ Q → I ⊗ Q,

∼

Ok×μ (ΠX ) ⊗ Q → I(ΠX ) ⊗ Q

— i.e., within which the lattices Ok×μ ⊗ (2p)−1 , Ok×μ (ΠX ) ⊗ (2p)−1 correspond, respectively, to I, I(ΠX ). In particular, by applying these bijections,
we may think of the topological modules I, I(ΠX ) as objects constructed from
the topological modules Ok×μ , Ok×μ (Gk ) [cf. the notation introduced at the
beginning of the present §2.12; the notation of Example 2.12.1, (iv)], i.e., as
objects constructed from mono-analytic structures [cf. the discussion of §2.7,
(vii)].
That is to say, in addition to the holomorphic Frobenius-like and holomorphic
étale-like versions of the log-shell discussed above, one may also consider monoanalytic Frobenius-like and mono-analytic étale-like versions of the log-shell.
All four of these versions of the log-shell play an important role in inter-universal Teichmüller theory [cf. the discussion of §3.6, (iv), below; [IUTchIII], Deﬁnition 1.1, (i),
(iv); [IUTchIII], Proposition 1.2, (v), (vi), (viii), (ix), (x); [IUTchIII], Remark 3.9.5,
(vii), (Ob7); [IUTchIII], Remark 3.12.2, (iv), (v)]. Returning to the issue of the noncommutativity [i.e., “ ?”] of the diagram of (iii), we observe the following:
the inclusions of “regions” discussed above may be interpreted as asserting that
the holomorphic étale-like log shell I(ΠX ) serves as a container for [i.e., as
a “region” that contains] the images — i.e., of Ok , Ok× ⊆ Ok , or, in the
case of multiple iterates of log, even smaller subsets of Ok× — via all possible
composites of arrows of the diagram of (iii) [including the “. . .” on the leftand right-hand sides of the diagram!].
This property of the log-shell will be referred to as upper semi-commutativity [cf.
[IUTchIII], Remark 1.2.2, (i), (iii)]. Thus, this property of upper semi-commutativity
constitutes a sort of Kummer-detachment indeterminacy [cf. the discussion of §2.7,
(vi)] and may be regarded as an answer to the question of computing the discrepancy
between the two Kummer theories in the domain and codomain of the link “log”
[cf. the discussion at the beginning of §2.9]. Another important answer, in the context
of inter-universal Teichmüller theory, to this computational question is given by the
theory of log-volumes [i.e., where we use the term log-volume to refer to the natural
logarithm of the volume ∈ R>0 of a region]:
There is a natural deﬁnition of the notion of the log-volume ∈ R of a region [i.e.,
compact open subset] of k = {0} ∪ (Ok )gp , which is normalized so that the

Shinichi Mochizuki

42

log-volume of Ok is 0, while the log-volume of p·Ok is − log(p). This log-volume
is compatible [in the evident sense] with passage between the four versions
of log-shells discussed above, as well as with log in the sense that it assumes
the same value ∈ R on regions that are mapped bijectively to one another via
logk [cf. [AbsTopIII], Proposition 5.7, (i); [IUTchIII], Proposition 1.2, (iii);
[IUTchIII], Proposition 3.9, (i), (ii), (iv); [IUTchIII], Remark 3.9.4].
These properties of upper semi-commutativity and log-volume compatibility will
be suﬃcient for the purposes of inter-universal Teichmüller theory.
(v) Finally, we observe that since the operation log — which maps
  
and relates unit groups [cf. (Ok× )pf ] to value groups [i.e., nonzero non-units of k] —
may be thought of as an operation that “juggles”, or “rotates”, the two underlying
combinatorial dimensions [cf. the discussion of §2.11] of the ring k [cf. [AbsTopIII],
§I3], one may think of this operation log, relative to the analogy discussed in §2.2,
§2.3, §2.4, §2.5, and §2.7 with the classical theory of §1.4 and §1.5, as corresponding to
the discussion of the eﬀect on “local masses” of the rotations that appeared in the
discussion of Step 7 of §1.5.

GX  ΠX for the quotient of GX determined by the maximal subextension of K X
that is unramiﬁed over X [so ΠX may be thought of, for a suitable choice of basepoint,
as the étale fundamental group of X]. Thus, when k is an MLF, X and ΠX are as in
Example 2.12.3, (i). Here, for simplicity, we assume further that X is of genus ≥ 1, and
def
write ΔX = Ker(ΠX  Gk ); X cp for the natural [smooth, proper] compactiﬁcation of
cp
X; ΔX  Δcp
X for the quotient of ΔX by the cuspidal inertia groups of ΔX [so ΔX

MX = HomZ (H 2 (Δcp

X , hence also the cyclotome MX ,
may be constructed by means of a purely group-theoretic algorithm from the abstract
topological group ΠX [cf. [AbsTopI], Lemma 4.5, (v); [IUTchI], Remark 1.2.2, (ii)]. Now
observe that

43

the Frobenius-like data that appears in the various examples [i.e., Examples
2.12.1, 2.12.2, 2.12.3] of mono-anabelian transport discussed in §2.12 only
involve the two underlying combinatorial dimensions of [various portions
of] the ind-topological monoid “Ok ” of these examples.
That is to say, although, for instance, the étale-like data [i.e., “ΠX ”] that appears in
Example 2.12.3 involves the relative geometric dimension of X over k [i.e., in the
case where k is an MLF], the Frobenius-like data [i.e., “Ok ”] that appears in these
examples does not involve this geometric dimension of X over k. On the other hand,
in inter-universal Teichmüller theory, it will be of crucial importance [cf. the discussion
of §3.4, §3.6, below; [IUTchIII], Remark 2.3.3] to consider such Frobenius-like data
that involves the geometric dimension of X over k — i.e., in more concrete terms, to
consider nonconstant rational functions on X — together with various evaluation
operations that arise by evaluating such functions on various “special points” of X
[or coverings of X]. In fact, the fundamental importance of such evaluation operations
may also be seen in the discussion of §2.14, (i), (ii), (iii), below. In the remainder of the
present §2.13, we discuss what is perhaps the most fundamental example of cyclotomic
rigidity and mono-anabelian transport for such geometric functions.
Example 2.13.1.

topological group “GX (ΠX )” of (i) [hence is only well-deﬁned up to inner automorphisms

As discussed in Example 2.12.1, (iv) [cf. also the discussion of [IUTchIII], Remark 2.3.3,
(vii)], this approach to cyclotomic rigidity has the disadvantage of being incompatible with the proﬁnite topology of GX [or ΠX ].
(iii) We continue to use the notational conventions of (ii). Then observe that the
functorial construction of the {±1}-orbit of the cyclotomic rigidity isomorphism λ given
in (ii) may be interpreted in the fashion of Example 2.12.2, (i). That is to say, observe

that this functorial construction implies that if α is an arbitrary automorphism of the

Example 5.1, (v); [IUTchI], Deﬁnition 5.2, (vi)]. Just as in the case of Example 2.12.2,
(i), this situation may also be understood in terms of the general framework of monoanabelian transport discussed in §2.7, (v) [cf. also Example 2.6.1, (iii), (iv)], by

(iv) Finally, we pause to remark that one fundamental reason for the use of
Kummer theory in inter-universal Teichmüller theory in the context of nonconstant
rational functions [i.e., as in the discussion of the present Example 2.13.1] lies in
the functoriality of Kummer theory with respect to the operation of evaluation of such functions at “special points” of X.
That is to say, [cf. the discussion of Example 2.6.1, (ii), (iii); §2.7, (vii)] although
there exist many diﬀerent versions — e.g., versions for “higher-dimensional ﬁelds” — of
class ﬁeld theory, these versions of class ﬁeld theory do not satisfy such functoriality
properties with respect to the operation of evaluation of functions at points [cf. the
discussion of §2.14, §3.6, §4.2, below; [IUTchIV], Remark 2.3.3, (vi)].

§ 2.14.

Finite discrete approximations of harmonic analysis

Finally, we conclude the present §2 by pausing to examine in a bit more detail the
transition that was, in eﬀect, made earlier in the present §2 in passing from derivatives
[in the literal sense, as in the discussion of §2.5] to Galois groups/étale fundamental
groups [i.e., as in the discussion of and subsequent to §2.6]. This transition is closely
related to many of the ideas of the [scheme-theoretic] Hodge-Arakelov theory of
[HASurI], [HASurII].
Example 2.14.1.
Finite discrete approximation of diﬀerential calculus
on the real line. We begin by recalling that the diﬀerential calculus of [say, inﬁnitely
diﬀerentiable] functions on the real line admits a ﬁnite discrete approximation,
namely, by substituting

diﬀerence operators for derivatives [in the classical sense]. If d is a positive integer,
then one veriﬁes easily, by considering such diﬀerence operators in the case of polynomial functions of degree < d with coeﬃcients ∈ Q, that evaluation at the elements
0, 1, . . . , d − 1 ∈ Z ⊆ Q yields a natural isomorphism of Q-vector spaces of dimension d

— cf., e.g., the discussion of the well-known classical theory of Hilbert polynomials in
[Harts], Chapter I, §7, for more details. In fact, it is not diﬃcult to compute explicitly
the “denominators” necessary to make this evaluation isomorphism into an isomorphism
of ﬁnite free Z-modules. This sort of “discrete function theory” [cf. also Example 2.14.2
below] may be regarded as the fundamental prototype for the various constructions
of Hodge-Arakelov theory.
Example 2.14.2.
Finite discrete approximation of Fourier analysis on
the unit circle. In the spirit of the discussion of Example 2.14.1, we recall that classical
function theory — i.e., in eﬀect, Fourier analysis — on the unit circle S1 admits a
well-known ﬁnite discrete approximation: If d is a(n) [say, for simplicity] odd positive
def
integer, so d∗ = 12 (d − 1) ∈ Z, then one veriﬁes easily that evaluation of polynomial

as a sort of ﬁnite discrete approximation of S1 and hence, in particular, of adjacent
pairs of d-torsion points as “tangent vectors” on S1 . That is to say, since [inverse
systems of] such torsion points give rise to the étale fundamental group of Gm ×Z C, it
is precisely this “picture” of torsion points of S1 that motivates the idea that
Galois groups/étale fundamental groups should be regarded as a sort of
arithmetic analogue of the classical geometric notion of a tangent bundle
— the discussion of §2.6. Moreover, if one regards Gm as the codomain of a nonzero
function [on some unspeciﬁed “space”], then this very classical “pictorial representation
of a cyclotome” [i.e., of torsion points of S1 ] also explains, from a “pictorial point of
view”, the importance of cyclotomes and Kummer classes in the discussion of §2.6,
§2.7. That is to say,
a Kummer class of a function, which, so to speak, records the “arithmetic
inﬁnitesimal motion” in Gm induced, via the function, by an “arithmetic inﬁnitesimal motion” in the space on which the function is deﬁned may be thought
of as a sort of “arithmetic logarithmic derivative” of the function
— a point of view that is consistent with the usual point of view that the Kummer
exact sequence in étale cohomology [i.e., which induces a connecting homomorphism in
cohomology that computes the Kummer class of a function] should be thought of as a
sort of arithmetic analogue of the exponential exact sequence 1 → 2πi · Z → C →
C× → 1 that appears in the theory of sheaf cohomology of sheaves of holomorphic
functions on a complex space.
Example 2.14.3.
Finite discrete approximation of harmonic analysis
on complex tori. Examples 2.14.1 and 2.14.2 admit a natural generalization to the
case of elliptic curves. Indeed, let E be an elliptic curve over a ﬁeld F of characteristic
zero, E † → E the universal extension of E, η ∈ E(F ) a [nontrivial] torsion point of
order 2, l = 2 a prime number. Write E[l] ⊆ E for the subscheme of l-torsion points,
def
L = OE (l · [η]) [where “[η]” denotes the eﬀective divisor on E determined by η]. Here,
we recall that E † → E is an A1 -torsor [so E[l] may also be regarded as the subscheme
⊆ E † of l-torsion points of E † ]. In particular, it makes sense to speak of the sections
Γ(E † , L|E † )<l ⊆ Γ(E † , L|E † ) of L over E † whose relative degree, with respect to the

48

Shinichi Mochizuki

morphism E † → E, is < l. Then the simplest version of the fundamental theorem
of Hodge-Arakelov theory states that evaluation at the subscheme of l-torsion
points E[l] ⊆ E † yields a natural isomorphism of F -vector spaces of dimension l2
Γ(E † , L|E † )<l

∼

→

L|E[l]

[cf. [HASurI], Theorem Asimple ]. Moreover:
· When F is an NF, this isomorphism is compatible, up to mild discrepancies,
with natural integral structures on the LHS and RHS of the isomorphism
at the nonarchimedean valuations of F and with natural Hermitian metrics
on the LHS and RHS of the isomorphism at the archimedean valuations of F .
· When F is a complete discrete valuation ﬁeld, and E is a Tate curve over F ,
with special ﬁber isomorphic to Gm , Example 2.14.2 may be thought of as
corresponding to the portion of the natural isomorphism of the above display
that arises from the “special ﬁber of E”, while Example 2.14.1 may be
thought of as corresponding to the portion of the natural isomorphism of the
above display that arises from the “special ﬁber of the relative dimension
of the morphism E † → E”.
· When E is a Tate curve, the isomorphism, over F , of the above display may
be interpreted as a result concerning the invertibility of the matrix determined
by the values at the l-torsion points of certain theta functions associated to
the Tate curve and their derivatives of order < l [cf., §3.4, (iii), below; §3.6,
(ii), below; [Fsk], §2.5; [EtTh], Proposition 1.4, for a review of the series representation of such theta functions].
· When F is an arbitrary ﬁeld, the isomorphism of the above display may be
thought of as a sort of discrete polynomial version of the Gaussian inte√
2
∞
gral −∞ e−x dx = π, i.e., in the spirit of the discussion of Examples 2.14.1
and 2.14.2, above.
· When F is an NF, the isomorphism of the above display may be thought of
as a sort of discrete globalized version of the harmonic analysis involving “∂, ∂, Green’s functions, etc.” that appears at archimedean valuations in
classical Arakelov theory. This is the reason for the appearance of the word
“Arakelov” in the term “Hodge-Arakelov theory”. From this point of view, the
computation of the discrepancy between natural integral structures/metrics on
the LHS and RHS of the isomorphism of the above display may be thought of
as a sort of computation of analytic torsion — a point of view that in some
sense foreshadows the interpretation [cf. the discussion of §3.9, (iii), below]
of inter-universal Teichmüller theory as the computation of a sort of global
arithmetic/Galois-theoretic form of analytic torsion.

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

49

· The isomorphism of the above display may also be thought of as a sort of
global (“function-theoretic”!) arithmetic version of the (“linear”!)
comparison isomorphisms that occur in complex or p-adic Hodge theory.
[That is to say, the LHS and RHS of the isomorphism of the above display
correspond, respectively, to the “de Rham” and “étale” sides of comparison isomorphisms in p-adic Hodge theory.] This is the reason for the appearance of the
word “Hodge” in the term “Hodge-Arakelov theory”. This point of view gives
rise to a natural deﬁnition for a sort of arithmetic version of the KodairaSpencer morphism discussed in §2.9, in which Galois groups play the role
played by tangent bundles in the classical version of the Kodaira-Spencer
morphism reviewed in §2.9 [cf. [HASurI], §1.4]. When E is a Tate curve
over a complete discrete valuation ﬁeld F , this arithmetic Kodaira-Spencer
morphism essentially coincides, when formulated properly, with the classical
Kodaira-Spencer morphism reviewed in §2.9 [cf. [HASurII], Corollary 3.6].
· Relative to the point of view of “ﬁltered crystals” [e.g., vector bundles equipped
with a connection and ﬁltration — cf. the data (E, ∇E , ωE ⊆ E) of §2.9], the
isomorphism of the above display may be thought of as a sort of discrete
Galois-theoretic version of the “crystalline theta object” [cf. [HASurII],
§2.3; the remainder of [HASurII], §2], i.e., in essence, the “nonlinear ﬁltered
crystal” constituted by the universal extension E † equipped with the ample
line bundle L|E † , the natural crystal structure on (E † , L|E † ), and the “ﬁltration”
constituted by the morphism E † → E.
We refer to [HASurI], [HASurII], for more details concerning the ideas just discussed.
§ 3.

Multiradiality: an abstract analogue of parallel transport
§ 3.1.

The notion of multiradiality

So far, in §2, we have discussed various generalities concerning arithmetic changes
of coordinates [cf. §2.10; the analogy discussed in §2.2, §2.5, and §2.7 with the classical
theory of §1.4 and §1.5], which are applied in eﬀect to the two underlying combinatorial dimensions of a ring such as an MLF or an NF [cf. §2.7, (vii); §2.11; §2.12],
and the approach to computing the eﬀect of such arithmetic changes of coordinates —
i.e., in the form of Kummer-detachment indeterminacies or étale-transport indeterminacies [cf. §2.7, (vi); §2.9] — by means of the technique of mono-anabelian
transport [cf. §2.7, (v)]. By contrast, in the present §3, we turn to the issue of considering the particular arithmetic changes of coordinates that are of interest in the

50

Shinichi Mochizuki

context of inter-universal Teichmüller theory [cf. the discussion of §2.1, §2.3, §2.4].
Many aspects of these particular arithmetic changes of coordinates are highly reminiscent of the change of coordinates discussed in §1.6 from planar cartesian to polar
coordinates. In some sense, the central notion that underlies the abstract combinatorial
analogue, i.e., that is developed in inter-universal Teichmüller theory, of this change of
coordinates from planar cartesian to polar coordinates is the notion of multiradiality.
(i) Types of mathematical objects: In the following discussion, we shall often
speak of “types of mathematical objects”, i.e., such as groups, rings, topological
spaces equipped with some additional structure, schemes, etc. This notion of a “type
of mathematical object” is formalized in [IUTchIV], §3, by introducing the notion of
a “species”. On the other hand, the details of this formalization are not so important
for the following discussion of the notion of multiradiality. A “type of mathematical
object” determines an associated category consisting of mathematical objects of this
type — i.e., in a given universe, or model of set theory — and morphisms between such
mathematical objects. On the other hand, in general, the structure of this associated
category [i.e., as an abstract category!] contains considerably less information than the
information that determines the “type of mathematical object” that one started with.
For instance, if p is a prime number, then the “type of mathematical object” given by
rings isomorphic to Z/pZ [and ring homomorphisms] yields a category whose equivalence
class as an abstract category is manifestly independent of the prime number p.
(ii) Radial environments: A radial environment consists of a triple. The
ﬁrst member of this triple is a speciﬁc “type of mathematical object” that is referred to
as radial data. The second member of this triple is a speciﬁc “type of mathematical
object” that is referred to as coric data. The third member of this triple is a functorial
algorithm that inputs radial data and outputs coric data; this algorithm is referred to
as radial, while the resulting functor from the category of radial data to the category
of coric data is referred to as the radial functor of the radial environment. We would
like to think of the coric data as a sort of “underlying structure” of the “ﬁner structure”
constituted by the radial data and of the radial algorithm as an algorithm that forgets
this “ﬁner structure”, i.e., an algorithm that assigns to a collection of radial data the
collection of underlying coric data of this given collection of radial data. We refer to
[IUTchII], Example 1.7, (i), (ii), for more details.
(iii) Multiradiality and uniradiality: A radial environment is called multiradial if its associated radial functor is full. A radial environment is called uniradial if
its associated radial functor is not full. One important consequence of the condition of
multiradiality is the following switching property:
Consider the category of objects consisting of an ordered pair of collections of

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

51

radial data, together with an isomorphism between the associated collections
of underlying coric data [and morphisms deﬁned in the evident way]. Observe
that this category admits a switching functor [from the category to itself]
that assigns to an object of the category the object obtained by switching the
two collections of radial data of the given object and replaces the isomorphism
between associated collections of underlying coric data by the inverse to this
isomorphism. Then multiradiality implies that the switching functor preserves
the isomorphism classes of objects.
Indeed, one veriﬁes immediately that multiradiality is in fact equivalent to the property
that any object of the category discussed in the above display is, in fact, isomorphic
to a “diagonal object”, i.e., an object given by considering an ordered pair of copies of
a given collection of radial data, together with the identity isomorphism between the
associated collections of underlying coric data — cf. the illustration of Fig. 3.1 below.
We refer to [IUTchII], Example 1.7, (ii), (iii), for more details.
(iv) Analogy with the Grothendieck deﬁnition of a connection: Thus, in
summary,
multiradiality concerns the issue of comparison between two collections
of radial data that share a common collection of underlying coric data.
We shall often think of this sort of comparison as a comparison between two “holomorphic structures” that share a common “underlying real analytic structure” [cf.
the examples discussed in §3.2 below]. Note that multiradiality may be thought of as a
sort of abstract analogue of the notion of “parallel transport” or, alternatively, the
Grothendieck deﬁnition of a connection [cf. the discussion of [IUTchII], Remark
1.7.1]. That is to say, given a scheme X over a scheme S, the Grothendieck deﬁnition of
a connection on an object E over X consists of an isomorphism between the ﬁbers of E
at two distinct — but inﬁnitesimally close! — points of X that map to the same point of
S. Thus, one may think of the fullness condition of multiradiality as the condition that
there exist a sort of parallel transport isomorphism between two collections of radial data
[i.e., corresponding to two “ﬁbers”] that lifts a given isomorphism between collections
of underlying coric data [i.e., corresponding to a path between the points over which
the two ﬁbers lie]. The indeterminacy in the choice of such a lifting may then be
thought of, relative to this analogy with parallel transport, as a sort of “monodromy”
associated to the multiradial environment.
(v) The Kodaira-Spencer morphism via multiradiality: The classical approach to proving the geometric version of the Szpiro Conjecture by means of the
Kodaira-Spencer morphism was reviewed in §2.9. Here, we observe that this argument
involving the Kodaira-Spencer morphism may be formulated in a way that

· renders explicit the analogy discussed in (iv) above between multiradiality
and connections, and, moreover,
· renders explicit the relationship between this classical argument involving
the Kodaira-Spencer morphism and the approach taken in inter-universal Teichmüller theory, that is to say, as a sort of “limiting case” or “degenerate
version” of the argument [sketched in the Introduction to the present paper —
cf. also the discussion of §2.3, §2.4] involving multiplication of the height
“h” by a factor “N ”, in the limit “N → ∞” [in which case comparison between “h” and “N · h”, or equivalently, between “h” and “ N1 · h”, becomes a
comparison between “h” and “0”].
This formulation may be broken down into steps, as follows. Let S log be as in §2.9, L a
line bundle on S. Suppose that we are interested in bounding deg(L) [i.e., bounding
the degree of L from above]. Then:
(1

KS

) Write p1 , p2 : S × S → S for the natural projections from the direct product S × S
to the ﬁrst and second factors. Suppose that we are given an isomorphism
∼

p∗1 L → p∗2 L
of line bundles on S × S between the pull-backs of L via p1 , p2 . Then one veriﬁes
immediately, by restricting to various ﬁbers of the direct product S × S, that the
existence of such an isomorphism implies that deg(L) = 0 [hence that deg(L) is
bounded], as desired.
(2

∼

KS

) Write Sδ for the ﬁrst inﬁnitesimal neighborhood of the diagonal (S → ) ΔS ⊆
S × S. Suppose that we are given an isomorphism
∼

p∗1 L|Sδ → p∗2 L|Sδ
of line bundles on Sδ between the restrictions to Sδ of the two pull-backs via p1 ,
p2 of L. Since S is proper [so any automorphism of the line bundle L on S is

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

53

given by multiplication by a nonzero complex number], one veriﬁes immediately
that an isomorphism as in the above display may be thought of as a connection,
in the sense of Grothendieck, on L [cf. the discussion of (iv) above!]. In particular,
since the base ﬁeld C is of characteristic zero, we thus conclude again [from the
elementary theory of de Rham-theoretic ﬁrst Chern classes of line bundles on curves]
that deg(L) = 0 [and hence that deg(L) is bounded], as desired.
(3

KS

) Let F be a rank two vector bundle that admits an exact sequence 0 → L →
F → L−1 → 0 of vector bundles on S. Thus, one may think of F as a container for
L. Write Sδlog for the ﬁrst inﬁnitesimal neighborhood of the “logarithmic diagonal”
∼
(S log → ) ΔS log ⊆ S log × S log . Next, suppose that we are given an isomorphism
∼

p∗1 F|S log → p∗2 F|S log
δ

of vector bundles on [the underlying scheme of] Sδlog between the restrictions to Sδlog
of the pull-backs via p1 , p2 of F. [Thus, such an isomorphism arises, for instance,
from a logarithmic connection on F.] Suppose, moreover, that this isomorphism
has nilpotent monodromy, i.e., that the restriction of this isomorphism to each of
the cusps of S log diﬀers from multiplication by a nonzero complex number by a
nilpotent endomorphism of the ﬁber of F at the cusp under consideration. Thus,
we obtain two inclusions

[where the “ → ” is the isomorphism of the ﬁrst display of the present (3 )] of line

deg(L) is bounded], as desired.

[where the “” is the restriction to Sδlog of the given surjection F  L−1 ], whose
restriction to ΔS log ⊆ Sδlog vanishes, hence determines a nonzero morphism of line
bundles on S
L → ωS log /C ⊗ L−1
[where we recall that the ideal sheaf deﬁning the closed [log] subscheme ΔS log ⊆
Sδlog may be naturally identiﬁed with the push-forward, via the natural inclusion
ΔS log → Sδlog , of the sheaf of logarithmic diﬀerentials ωS log /C ]. Now one veriﬁes
immediately that, if one takes F to be the vector bundle “E” of §2.9, equipped
KS
with the isomorphism as in the ﬁrst display of (3 ) arising from the logarithmic
connection ∇E , and L to be the subbundle “ωE ⊆ E” of §2.9, then the nonzero morphism of the above display may be identiﬁed with the Kodaira-Spencer morphism
ωE → τE ⊗OS ωS log /C discussed in §2.9. Thus, in summary,
the Kodaira-Spencer morphism may be thought of as a measure of
the discrepancy that arises when one ﬁxes the “ωE ” on one factor
of S and compares it with the “ωE ” on a distinct, “alien” factor of
S by means of the common container “E”, which is equipped with a
KS
connection “∇E ” [i.e., an isomorphism as in the ﬁrst display of (3 )].
When formulated in this way, the Kodaira-Spencer morphism becomes manifestly
analogous to the approach sketched in the Introduction to the present paper [cf.
also the discussion of §2.3, §2.4] to bounding heights of elliptic curves [cf. the
discussion of §3.7, (ii), (iv), below] by applying a suitable multiradiality property
[cf. the discussion of §3.7, (i), below], i.e., [in the language of the Introduction] a
“license to confuse”.
[Here, we note that, relative to the analogy with inter-universal Teichmüller theory, the
KS
KS
situation that arises in (2 ), (4 ) corresponds to the [unusual!] situation in which
there actually exists a “global multiplicative subspace” — cf. the discussion of §2.3.]
Finally, we remark in passing that the crystalline theta object referred to in the
discussion of Example 2.14.3 may be thought of as a sort of intermediate stage between
KS
the situation discussed in (5 ) and the situation that is ultimately considered in interuniversal Teichmüller theory.

Fundamental examples of multiradiality

The following examples may be thought of as fundamental prototypes of the
phenomenon of multiradiality.
Example 3.2.1.
Complex holomorphic structures on two-dimensional
real vector spaces.
(i) Consider the radial environment in which the radial data is given by onedimensional C-vector spaces [and isomorphisms between such data], the coric data
is given by two-dimensional R-vector spaces [and isomorphisms between such data],
and the radial algorithm assigns to a one-dimensional C-vector space the associated
underlying R-vector space. Then one veriﬁes immediately that this radial environment,
shown in Fig. 3.2 above, is uniradial [cf. [Pano], Figs. 2.2, 2.3].
(ii) If V is a two-dimensional real vector space, then write End(V ) for the R-algebra
of R-linear endomorphisms of V and GL(V ) for the group of invertible elements of
End(V ). Observe that if V is a two-dimensional real vector space, then a complex — i.e.,
“holomorphic” — structure on V may be thought of as a homomorphism of R-algebras
C → End(V ). In particular, it makes sense to speak of a GL-orbit of complex
structures on V , i.e., the set of GL(V )-conjugates of some such homomorphism. Now
consider the radial environment in which a collection of radial data consists of a twodimensional R-vector space equipped with a GL-orbit of complex structures [and the
morphisms between such data are taken to be the isomorphisms between such data],
the coric data is the same as the coric data of (i), and the radial algorithm assigns
to a two-dimensional R-vector space equipped with a GL-orbit of complex structures
the associated underlying R-vector space. Then one veriﬁes immediately that this radial
environment, shown in Fig. 3.3 below, is [“tautologically”!] multiradial [cf. [Pano],
Figs. 2.2, 2.3].
(iii) The examples of radial environments discussed in (i), (ii) are particularly of
interest in the context of inter-universal Teichmüller theory in light of the relationship

as discussed in [BogIUT] [cf. also the discussion of §2.4, as well as of §3.10, (vi); §4.1,
(i); §4.3, (iii), of the present paper]. This circle of ideas is also of interest, in the context
of inter-universal Teichmüller theory, in the sense that it is reminiscent of the natural

the dilation ∈ [0, 1) associated to this deformation [cf. [QuCnf], Proposition A.1, (ii)].

§ 3.3.

The log-theta-lattice: Θ±ell N F -Hodge theaters, log-links, Θ-links

The fundamental stage on which the constructions of inter-universal Teichmüller
theory are performed is referred to as the log-theta-lattice.
(i) Initial Θ-data: The log-theta-lattice is completely determined, up to isomorphism, once one ﬁxes a collection of initial Θ-data. Roughly speaking, this data
consists of
· an elliptic curve EF over a number ﬁeld F ,
· an algebraic closure F of F ,
· a prime number l ≥ 5,
· a collection of valuations V of a certain subﬁeld K ⊆ F , and
· a collection of valuations Vbad
mod of a certain subﬁeld Fmod ⊆ F
that satisfy certain technical conditions — cf. [IUTchI], Deﬁnition 3.1, for more details.
Here, we write Fmod ⊆ F for the ﬁeld of moduli of EF , i.e., the ﬁeld extension of
Q obtained by adjoining the j-invariant of EF ; K ⊆ F for the extension ﬁeld of F
generated by the ﬁelds of deﬁnition of the l-torsion points of EF ; XF ⊆ EF for
the once-punctured elliptic curve obtained by removing the origin from EF ; and
XF → CF for the hyperbolic orbicurve obtained by forming the stack-theoretic quotient
of XF by the natural action of {±1}. Also, in the following, we shall write V(−) for the
set of all [nonarchimedean and archimedean] valuations of an NF “(−)” and append a
subscripted element ∈ V(−) to the NF to denote the completion of the NF at the element
∈ V(−). We assume further that the following conditions are satisﬁed [cf. [IUTchI],
Deﬁnition 3.1, for more details]:
· F is Galois over Fmod of degree prime to l and contains the ﬁelds of deﬁnition
of the 2·3-torsion points of EF ;
· the image of the natural inclusion Gal(K/F ) → GL2 (Fl ) [well-deﬁned up to
composition with an inner automorphism] contains SL2 (Fl );
· EF has stable reduction at all of the nonarchimedean valuations of F ;
def
· CK = CF ×F K is a K-core, i.e., does not admit a ﬁnite étale covering
that is isomorphic to a ﬁnite étale covering of a Shimura curve [cf. [CanLift],
Remarks 2.1.1, 2.1.2]; this condition implies that there exists a unique model
CFmod of CF over Fmod [cf. the discussion of [IUTchI], Remark 3.1.7, (i)];
· V ⊆ V(K) is a subset such that the natural inclusion Fmod ⊆ F ⊆ K induces
∼
def
a bijection V → Vmod between V and the set Vmod = V(Fmod );
· Vbad
mod ⊆ Vmod is a nonempty set of nonarchimedean valuations of odd residue
characteristic over which EF has bad [i.e., multiplicative] reduction, that is
to say, roughly speaking, the subset of the set of valuations where EF has bad

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

59

multiplicative reduction that will be “of interest” to us in the context of the
constructions of inter-universal Teichmüller theory.
The above conditions in fact imply that K is Galois over Fmod [cf. [IUTchI], Remark
3.1.5]. We shall write
def

Vbad = Vbad
mod ×Vmod V ⊆ V,

def

bad
Vgood
mod = Vmod \ Vmod ,

def

Vgood = V \ Vbad

and apply the superscripts “non” and “arc” to V, Vmod , and V(−) to denote the subsets
of nonarchimedean and archimedean valuations, respectively. The data listed above
determines, up to K-isomorphism [cf. [IUTchI], Remark 3.1.3], a ﬁnite étale covering
C K → CK of degree l such that the base-changed covering

def
points of EK (K) [where we write EK = EF ×F K] which, at v ∈ Vbad , restricts to the
quotient arising from coverings of the dual graph of the special ﬁber.
(ii) The log-theta-lattice: The log-theta-lattice, various versions of which are
deﬁned in [IUTchIII] [cf. [IUTchIII], Deﬁnitions 1.4; 3.8, (iii)], is a [highly noncommutative!] two-dimensional diagram that consists of three types of components,
namely, •’s, ↑’s, and →’s [cf. the portion of Fig. 3.6 below that lies to the left of
the “⊇”]. Each “•” in Fig. 3.6 represents a Θ±ell N F -Hodge theater, which may
be thought of as a sort of miniature model of the conventional arithmetic geometry
surrounding the given initial Θ-data. Each vertical arrow “↑” in Fig. 3.6 represents
a log-link, i.e., a certain type of gluing between various portions of the Θ±ell N F Hodge theaters that constitute the domain and codomain of the arrow. Each horizontal
arrow “→” in Fig. 3.6 represents a Θ-link [various versions of which are deﬁned in
[IUTchI], [IUTchII], [IUTchIII]], i.e., another type of gluing between various portions
of the Θ±ell N F -Hodge theaters that constitute the domain and codomain of the arrow.
The portion of the log-theta-lattice that is ultimately actually used to prove the main
results of inter-universal Teichmüller theory is shown in the portion of Fig. 3.6 — i.e.,
a sort of “inﬁnite letter H” — that lies to the right of the “⊇”. On the other hand,
the signiﬁcance of considering the entire log-theta-lattice may be seen in the fact that
— unlike the portion of Fig. 3.6 that lies to the right of the “⊇”! —
the [entire] log-theta-lattice is symmetric, up to unique isomorphism, with
respect to arbitrary horizontal and vertical translations.
Various objects constructed from the •’s of the log-theta-lattice will be referred to as
horizontally coric if they are invariant with respect to arbitrary horizontal transla-

Fig. 3.6: The entire log-theta-lattice and the portion that is actually used
tions, as vertically coric if they are invariant with respect to arbitrary vertical translations, and as bi-coric if they are both horizontally and vertically coric. In this context,
we observe that — unlike any ﬁnite portion of a vertical line of the log-theta-lattice! —
each [inﬁnite!] vertical line of the log-theta-lattice is symmetric, up to unique
isomorphism, with respect to arbitrary vertical translations.
As we shall see in §3.6, (iv), below, this is precisely why [cf. the portion of Fig. 3.6
that lies to the right of the “⊇”] it will ultimately be necessary to work with the entire
inﬁnite vertical lines of the log-theta-lattice [i.e., as opposed to with some ﬁnite portion
of such a vertical line]. Finally, we remark that
the two dimensions of the log-theta-lattice may be thought of as corresponding to the two underlying combinatorial dimensions of a ring [cf. the
discussion of these two dimensions in the case of NF’s and MLF’s in §2.11], i.e.,
to addition and multiplication.
Indeed, the Θ-link only involves the multiplicative structure of the rings that appear
and, at an extremely rough level, may be understood as corresponding to thinking of
“numbers” as elements of the multiplicative monoid of positive integers
 N
p
N≥1 ∼
=
p

— where p ranges over the prime numbers, and N denotes the additive monoid of
nonnegative integers — that is to say, as elements of an abstract monoid that admits
automorphisms that switch distinct prime numbers p1 , p2 , as well as endomorphisms
given by raising to the N -th power [cf. the discussion of §2.4]. By contrast, the log-link
may be understood as corresponding to a link between, or rotation/juggling of, the

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

61

additive and multiplicative structures at the various completions of an NF that is
obtained by means of the various natural logarithms deﬁned on these completions [cf.
the discussion of Example 2.12.3, (v)]. Here, we observe that the noncommutativity
of the log-theta-lattice [which was mentioned at the beginning of the present (ii)] arises
precisely from the fact that
the deﬁnition of the Θ-link, which only involves the multiplicative structure
of the rings that appear, is fundamentally incompatible with — i.e., only
makes sense once one deactivates — the rotation/juggling of the additive
and multiplicative structures that arises from the log-link.
In particular, the Θ-link may only be deﬁned if one distinguishes between the domain and
codomain of the log-link, i.e., between distinct vertical coordinates in a single vertical
line of the log-theta-lattice. Moreover,
this state of aﬀairs, i.e., which requires one [in order to deﬁne the Θ-link!]
to distinguish the ring structures in the domain and codomain of the loglink [which are related in a non-ring-theoretic fashion to one another via
the log-link!], makes it necessary to think of the [possibly tempered] arithmetic
fundamental groups in the domain and codomain of the log-link as being related
via indeterminate isomorphisms
— i.e., as discussed in §2.10; Example 2.12.3, (ii) [cf. the discussion of [IUTchIII], Remark 1.2.2, (vi), (a); [IUTchIII], Remark 1.2.4, (i); [IUTchIV], Remark 3.6.3, (i)]. This
situation may be understood by means of the analogy with the situation in complex
Teichmüller theory:
one deforms one real dimension of the complex structure, while holding the
other real dimension ﬁxed — an operation that is only meaningful if these two
distinct real dimensions are not subject to rotations, i.e., to indeterminacies
with respect to the action of S1 ⊆ C× [cf. [IUTchI], Remark 3.9.3, (ii), (iii),
(iv)].
Put another way, the portion of the log-theta-lattice that is “actually used” [cf. Fig. 3.6]
exhibits substantial structural similarities to the natural bijection

[where R  t ≥ 1] discussed in Example 3.2.1, (iii), that is to say:

the deformation of holomorphic structure “ 0t 01 ” may be thought of as
corresponding to the single Θ-link of this portion of the log-theta-lattice, while

62

Shinichi Mochizuki

the “C× ’s” on either side of the “GL+ (V )” may be thought of as corresponding,
respectively, to the vertical lines of log-links — i.e., rotations of the arithmetic holomorphic structure! — on either side of the single Θ-link.
In the context of this natural bijection discussed in Example 3.2.1, (iii), it is of interest
to observe that this double coset space “C× \GL+ (V )/C× ” is also reminiscent of the
double coset spaces associated to groups of matrices over p-adic ﬁelds that arise in the
theory of Hecke correspondences. Alternatively, relative to the analogy with the
two dimensions of an MLF, if the MLF under consideration is absolutely unramiﬁed,
i.e., isomorphic to the quotient ﬁeld of a ring of Witt vectors, then one may think of
· the log-link as corresponding to the Frobenius morphism in positive characteristic, i.e., to one of the two underlying combinatorial dimensions — namely,
the slope zero dimension — of the MLF and of
· the Θ-link as corresponding to the mixed characteristic extension structure of a ring of Witt vectors, i.e., to the transition from pn Z/pn+1 Z to
pn−1 Z/pn Z, which may be thought of as corresponding to the other of the two
underlying combinatorial dimensions — namely, the positive slope dimension —
of the MLF.
We refer to [IUTchI], §I4; [IUTchIII], Introduction; [IUTchIII], Remark 1.4.1, (iii);
[IUTchIII], Remark 3.12.4; [Pano], §2, for more details concerning the numerous analogies between inter-universal Teichmüller theory and various aspects of the p-adic theory, such as the canonical liftings that play a central role in the p-adic Teichmüller
theory of [pOrd], [pTch], [pTchIn].
(iii) The notion of a Frobenioid: A Frobenioid is an abstract category whose
abstract categorical structure may be thought of, roughly speaking, as encoding
the theory of divisors and line bundles on various “coverings” — i.e., normalizations in various ﬁnite separable extensions of the function ﬁeld — of a
given normal integral scheme.
Here, the category of such “coverings” is referred to as the base category of the
Frobenioid. All of the Frobenioids that play a [non-negligible] role in inter-universal
Teichmüller theory are model Frobenioids [cf. [FrdI], Theorem 5.2] whose base category corresponds to “some sort of” — that is to say, possibly tempered, in the sense
of [André], §4; [Semi], Example 3.10 — arithmetic fundamental group [i.e., in the
non-tempered case, the étale fundamental group of a normal integral scheme of ﬁnite
type over some sort of “arithmetic ﬁeld”]. In particular, all of the Frobenioids that play
a [non-negligible] role in inter-universal Teichmüller theory are essentially equivalent to
a collection of data as follows that satisﬁes certain properties:

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

63

· a topological group, i.e., the [possibly tempered] arithmetic fundamental
group;
· for each open subgroup of the topological group, an abelian group, called the
rational function monoid, i.e., since it is a category-theoretic abstraction of
the multiplicative group of rational functions on the “covering” corresponding
to the given open subgroup;
· for each open subgroup of the topological group, an abelian monoid, called the
divisor monoid, i.e., since it is a category-theoretic abstraction of the monoid
of Weil divisors on the “covering” corresponding to the given open subgroup.
In particular, such Frobenioids may be thought of as category-theoretic abstractions of
various aspects of the multiplicative portion of the ring structure of a normal integral
scheme. We refer to §3.5 below for more remarks on the use of Frobenioids in interuniversal Teichmüller theory.
(iv) [Θ±ell N F -]Hodge theaters as “tautological solutions” to a purely
combinatorial problem: The Θ±ell N F -Hodge theater associated to a given collection of initial Θ-data as in (i) is a somewhat complicated system of Frobenioids [cf.
[IUTchI], Deﬁnition 6.13, (i)]. The topological group data for these Frobenioids arises
from various subquotients of the [possibly tempered] arithmetic fundamental groups of
the hyperbolic orbicurves discussed in (i). The rational function monoid data for these
Frobenioids arises from the multiplicative groups of nonzero elements of various ﬁnite
extensions of the number ﬁeld Fmod of (i) or localizations [i.e., completions] of such NF’s
at valuations lying over valuations ∈ V. The divisor monoid data for these Frobenioids
arises, in the case of NF’s, from the monoid of eﬀective arithmetic divisors [in the sense
of diophantine geometry — cf., e.g., [GenEll], §1; [FrdI], Example 6.3], possibly with
real coeﬃcients, and, in the case of localizations of NF’s, from the nonnegative portion
of the value group of the associated valuation, possibly tensored over Z with R. [In fact,
at valuations in Vbad , an additional type of Frobenioid, called a tempered Frobenioid,
also appears — cf. the discussion of §3.4, (iv); §3.5, below.] For instance, in the case of
localizations at valuations ∈ Vgood ∩ Vnon , one Frobenioid that appears quite frequently
in inter-universal Teichmüller theory consists of data that is essentially equivalent to
the data
“ΠX  Ok ”
considered in Example 2.12.3, (ii). [In the case of valuations ∈ Vbad , “ΠX ” is replaced
by the corresponding tempered arithmetic fundamental group; in the case of valuations
∈ Varc (⊆ Vgood ), one applies the theory of [AbsTopIII], §2.] In general, the Frobenioids
obtained by applying the operation of “passing to real coeﬃcients” are referred to as
realiﬁed Frobenioids [cf. [FrdI], Proposition 5.3]. The system of Frobenioids that

64

Shinichi Mochizuki

constitutes a Θ±ell N F -Hodge theater determines, by passing to the associated system
of base categories, an apparatus that is referred to as a D-Θ±ell N F -Hodge theater [cf.
[IUTchI], Deﬁnition 6.13, (ii)]. The purpose of considering such systems of Frobenioids
lies in the goal of
reassembling the distribution of primes in the number ﬁeld K [cf. the
discussion of [IUTchI], Remark 4.3.1] in such a way as to render possible the
construction of some sort of global version of the “Gaussian distribution”
2

{q j }j=1,...,l
discussed at the end of §2.4, i.e., which, a priori, is only deﬁned at the valuations
∈ V(K)non at which EK has bad multiplicative reduction [such as, for instance,
the valuations ∈ Vbad ].
This “global version” amounts to the local and global value group portions of the data
that appears in the domain portion of the Θ-link [cf. (vii) below]. The reassembling,
referred to above, of the distribution of primes in the number ﬁeld K was one of the
fundamental motivating issues for the author in the development of the absolute monoanabelian geometry of [AbsTopIII], i.e., of a version of anabelian geometry that diﬀers
fundamentally from the well-known anabelian result of Neukirch-Uchida concerning
absolute Galois groups of NF’s [cf., e.g., [NSW], Chapter XII, §2] in [numerous ways, but,
in particular, in] that its reconstruction of an NF does not depend on the distribution
of primes in the NF [cf. the discussion of [IUTchI], Remarks 4.3.1, 4.3.2]. The problem,
referred to above, of constructing a sort of “global Gaussian distribution” may in
fact easily be seen to be
essentially equivalent to the “purely combinatorial” problem of constructing
a “global multiplicative subspace” [cf. the discussion of §2.3], together with
a “global canonical generator”, i.e., more precisely: a one-dimensional Fl subspace of the two-dimensional Fl -vector space EK [l] of l-torsion points of the
elliptic curve EK , together with a generator, well-deﬁned up to multiplication
by ±1, of the quotient of EK [l] by this one-dimensional Fl -subspace, such that
this subspace and generator coincide, at the valuations ∈ V(K) that lie over
valuations ∈ Vbad
mod , with a certain canonical such subspace and generator that
arise from a generator [again, well-deﬁned up to multiplication by ±1] of the
Galois group [isomorphic to Z] of the well-known inﬁnite covering of a Tate
curve.
Here, we note that such a “global canonical generator” determines a bijection, which
is well-deﬁned up to multiplication by ±1, of the quotient referred to above with the

Fig. 3.7: Prime-strips as “sections” of Spec(K) → Spec(Fmod )
underlying additive group of Fl . In a word, the combinatorial structure of a Θ±ell N F Hodge theater furnishes a sort of “tautological solution” to the purely combinatorial
problem referred to above by
simply ignoring the valuations ∈ V(K)\V, for instance, by working only with
Frobenioids — i.e., in eﬀect, arithmetic divisors/line bundles — that arise
from arithmetic divisors supported on the set of valuations V (⊆ V(K)), i.e.,
as opposed to on the entire set V(K)
[cf. the discussion of [IUTchI], Remark 4.3.1]. Here, we note that this sort of operation
of discarding certain of the primes of an NF can only be performed if one forgets the
additive structure of an NF [i.e., since a sum of elements of an NF that are invertible
at a given nonempty set of primes is no longer necessarily invertible at those primes! —
cf. [AbsTopIII], Remark 5.10.2, (iv)] and works only with multiplicative structures,
e.g., with Frobenioids. Collections of local data — consisting, say, of local Frobenioids
or local [possibly tempered] arithmetic fundamental groups — indexed by the elements
of V are referred to as prime-strips [cf. Fig. 3.7 above; [IUTchI], Fig. I1.2, and the
surrounding discussion]. In a word, prime-strips may be thought of as a sort of monoidor Galois-theoretic version of the classical notion of adèles/idèles.

p-adic theory surrounding the moduli stack of elliptic curves over the p-adic integers
Zp [cf. the discussion of [IUTchI], Remark 4.3.1; [IUTchII], Remark 4.11.4, (iii), (c)].
(vi) log-links: Each vertical arrow

of the log-theta-lattice relates the various copies of
“ΠX  Ok ”
[cf. the discussion at the beginning of (iv)] that lie in the prime-strips of the domain
Θ±ell N F -Hodge theater “•” of the log-link to the corresponding copy of “ΠX  Ok ”
that lies in a prime-strip of the codomain Θ±ell N F -Hodge theater “•” of the log-link
in the fashion prescribed by the arrow “log” of the diagram of Example 2.12.3, (iii)
[with suitable modiﬁcations involving tempered arithmetic fundamental groups at the
valuations ∈ Vbad or the theory of [AbsTopIII], §2, at the valuations ∈ Varc (⊆ Vgood )].
In particular, the log-link may be thought of as “lying over” an isomorphism between
the respective copies of “ΠX ” which is indeterminate since [cf. the discussion of
§2.10; the discussion at the end of Example 2.12.3, (ii)] the two copies of “ΠX ” must
be regarded as distinct abstract topological groups. Put another way, from the point of
view of the discussion at the beginning of (iv),
the log-link induces an indeterminate isomorphism between the D-Θ±ell N F Hodge theaters associated to the Θ±ell N F -Hodge theaters “•” in the domain
and codomain of the log-link, that is to say, these D-Θ±ell N F -Hodge theaters
associated to the •’s of the log-theta-lattice are vertically coric [cf. [IUTchIII],
Theorem 1.5, (i)].
Now recall from Example 2.12.3, (i), that each abstract topological group “ΠX ” may be
regarded as the input data for a functorial algorithm that allows one to reconstruct
the base ﬁeld [in this case an MLF] of the hyperbolic curve “X”. Put another way,
from the point of view of the terminology discussed in §2.7, (vii), each copy of “ΠX ”
may be regarded as an arithmetic holomorphic structure on the quotient group
“ΠX  Gk ” associated to ΠX [cf. the discussion of Example 2.12.3, (i)]. Indeed, this
is precisely the point of the analogy between the fundamental prototypical examples —
i.e., Examples 3.2.1, 3.2.2 — of the phenomenon of multiradiality. The various “X’s”
that occur in a Θ±ell N F -Hodge theater are certain ﬁnite étale coverings of localizations
of the hyperbolic curve X K at various valuations ∈ V. These ﬁnite étale coverings are
X in
hyperbolic curves over Kv which are denoted X v in the case of v ∈ Vbad and −
→

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

the case of v ∈ Vgood [cf. [IUTchI], Deﬁnition 3.1, (e), (f)]. On the other hand, we
recall from [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9 [cf. also [AbsTopIII], Remark 1.9.2], that this
functorial algorithm may also be applied to the hyperbolic orbicurves X K , C K , or
CFmod , i.e., whose base ﬁelds are NF’s, in a fashion that is functorial [cf. the discussion
of [IUTchI], Remarks 3.1.2, 4.3.2] with respect to passing to ﬁnite étale coverings,
as well as with respect to localization at valuations of ∈ V [cf. also the theory of
[AbsTopIII], §2, in the case of valuations ∈ Varc ]. That is to say, in summary,
the various [possibly tempered, in the case of valuations ∈ Vbad ] arithmetic
fundamental groups of ﬁnite étale coverings of CFmod [such as X K , C K , or
CFmod itself] and their localizations at valuations ∈ V that appear in a Θ±ell N F Hodge theater may be regarded as abstract representations of the arithmetic
holomorphic structure [i.e., ring structure — cf. the discussion of §2.7, (vii)]
of the various base ﬁelds of these hyperbolic orbicurves.
Moreover, this state of aﬀairs motivates the point of view that
the various localizations and gluings that occur in the structure of a single
Θ±ell N F -Hodge theater [cf. Fig. 3.8] or, as just described, in the structure
of a log-link [i.e., a vertical arrow of the log-theta-lattice — cf. Fig. 3.6] may
be thought of as arithmetic analytic continuations between various NF’s
along the various gluings of prime-strips that occur [cf. the discussion of
[IUTchI], Remarks 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.3.3, 5.1.4].
In this context, it is of interest to observe that, at a technical level, these arithmetic analytic continuations are achieved by applying the mono-anabelian theory of [AbsTopIII],
§1 [or, in the case of archimedean valuations, the theory of [AbsTopIII], §2]. Moreover,
this mono-anabelian theory of [AbsTopIII], §1, is, in essence, an elementary consequence
of the theory of Belyi cuspidalizations developed in [AbsTopII], §3 [cf. [AbsTopIII],
Remark 1.11.3]. Here, we recall that the term cuspidalization refers to a functorial algorithm in the arithmetic fundamental group of a hyperbolic curve for reconstructing the
arithmetic fundamental group of some dense open subscheme of the hyperbolic curve.
In particular, by considering Kummer classes of rational functions [cf. the discussion
of Example 2.13.1, (i)],
cuspidalization may be thought of as a sort of “equivalence” between the
function theory on a hyperbolic curve and the function theory on a dense open
subscheme of the hyperbolic curve — a formulation that is very formally reminiscent of the classical notion of analytic continuation.
The Belyi cuspidalizations developed in [AbsTopII], §3, are achieved as a formal
consequence of the elementary observation that

70

Shinichi Mochizuki

any “suﬃciently small” dense open subscheme U of the hyperbolic curve
P given by removing three points from the projective line may be regarded
— via the use of a suitable Belyi map! — as a ﬁnite étale covering of
P ; in particular, the arithmetic fundamental group of U may be recovered
from the arithmetic fundamental group of P by considering a suitable open
subgroup of the arithmetic fundamental group of P [cf. [AbsTopII], Example
3.6; [AbsTopII], Corollaries 3.7, 3.8, for more details].
This state of aﬀairs is all the more fascinating in that the well-known construction of
Belyi maps via an induction on the degree over Q of the ramiﬁcation locus of certain
rational maps between two projective lines is [cf. the discussion of [IUTchI], Remark
5.1.4] highly reminiscent of the well-known Schwarz lemma of elementary complex
analysis, i.e., to the eﬀect that the absolute value, relative to the respective Poincaré
metrics, of the derivative at any point of a holomorphic map between copies of the unit
disc is ≤ 1.
(vii) Θ-links: Various versions of the “Θ-link” are deﬁned in [IUTchI], [IUTchII],
[IUTchIII] — cf. [IUTchI], Corollary 3.7, (i); [IUTchII], Corollary 4.10, (iii); [IUTchIII],
Deﬁnition 3.8, (ii). In the present paper, we shall primarily be interested in the version
of [IUTchIII], Deﬁnition 3.8, (ii). The versions of [IUTchII], Corollary 4.10, (iii), are
partially simpliﬁed versions of the version that one is ultimately interested in [i.e., the
version of [IUTchIII], Deﬁnition 3.8, (ii)], while the version of [IUTchI], Corollary 3.7,
(i), is an even more drastically simpliﬁed version of these partially simpliﬁed versions.
The Θ-link may be understood, roughly speaking, as a realization of the version of the
assignment “q → q N ” considered in the ﬁnal portion of the discussion of §2.4, i.e., the
assignment
2

“q → {q j }j=1,...,l ”
given by taking a sort of symmetrized average as “N ” varies over the values j 2 , for
j = 1, . . . , l . At a more technical level, the Θ-link
Θ

• −→ •
is a gluing between two Θ±ell N F -Hodge theaters “•”, via an indeterminate [cf. the
discussion of §2.10] isomorphism between certain gluing data arising from the domain
Θ±ell N F -Hodge theater “•” and certain gluing data arising from the codomain Θ±ell N F Hodge theater “•”. The gluing data that arises from the domain “•” of the Θ-link is
as follows:
(aΘ ) [Local] unit group portion: Consider, in the notation of §2.11, §2.12 [cf., especially, Example 2.12.3, (iv)], the ind-topological monoid equipped with an action

by a topological group Gk  Ok×μ , where we note that Ok×μ is a Qp -vector space.
H

Observe that for each open subgroup H ⊆ Gk , which determines a subﬁeld k ⊆ k
of H-invariants of k, the image of O×H in Ok×μ determines an integral structure, or
k
“lattice” [i.e., a ﬁnite free Zp -module], in the Qp -vector subspace of H-invariants
(Ok×μ )H of Ok×μ . [Here, we note that the theory of the p-adic logarithm determines
H

a natural isomorphism between this subspace and the Qp -vector space k .] For
each v ∈ Vnon , we take the unit group portion data at v, to be this data
⊆ (Ok×μ )H }H )

— i.e., which we regard as an ind-topological monoid equipped with an action by a
topological group, together with, for each open subgroup of the topological group, an
def
def
integral structure — in the case k = Kv . When k = Kv , we shall write Gv = Gk .
An analogous construction may be performed for v ∈ Varc .
(bΘ ) Local value group portion: At each v ∈ Vbad , we take the local value group
portion data at v to be the formal monoid [abstractly isomorphic to the monoid N]
generated by

v


— i.e., where q ∈ OK
is a 2l-th root of the q-parameter qv of the elliptic curve

EK at v; the data of the above display is regarded as a collection of elements of

indexed by the elements of F
OK
l ; each element of this collection is well-deﬁned
v
up to multiplication by a 2l-th root of unity. An analogous, though somewhat more
formal, construction may be performed for v ∈ Vgood .
(cΘ ) Global value group portion: Observe that each of the local formal monoids
[say, for simplicity, at v ∈ Vbad ] of (bΘ ) may be realiﬁed. That is to say, the corresponding realiﬁed monoid is simply the monoid of R≥0 -multiples [i.e., nonnegative
real multiples] of the image of the given monoid [∼
= N] inside the tensor product
∼
⊗Z R of the groupiﬁcation [= Z] of this given monoid. Note, moreover, that the
product formula of elementary algebraic number theory yields a natural notion of
“ﬁnite collections of elements of the groupiﬁcations [∼
= R] of these realiﬁed monoids
at v ∈ V whose sum = 0”. This data, consisting of a realiﬁed monoid at each v ∈ V,
together with a collection of “product formula relations”, determines a global realiﬁed Frobenioid. We take the global value group portion data to be this global
realiﬁed Frobenioid.
The gluing data that arises from the codomain of the Θ-link is as follows:

Shinichi Mochizuki

72

(aq ) [Local] unit group portion: For each v ∈ V, we take the unit group portion
data at v to be the analogous data, i.e., this time constructed from the codomain
“•” of the Θ-link, to the data of (aΘ ).
(bq ) Local value group portion: At each v ∈ Vbad , we take the local value group
portion data at v to be the formal monoid [abstractly isomorphic to the monoid N]
generated by
q
v

— i.e., where we apply the notational conventions of (bΘ ). An analogous, though
somewhat more formal, construction may be performed for v ∈ Vgood .
(cq ) Global value group portion: We take the global value group portion data to be
the global realiﬁed Frobenioid [cf. the data of (cΘ )] determined by the realiﬁcations
of the local formal monoids of (bq ) at v ∈ V, together with a naturally determined
collection of “product formula relations”.
In fact, the above description is slightly inaccurate in a number of ways: for instance,
in [IUTchI], [IUTchII], [IUTchIII], the data of (aΘ ), (bΘ ), (cΘ ), (aq ), (bq ), (cq ) are constructed in a somewhat more intrinsic fashion directly from the various Frobenioids
[and other data] that constitute the Θ±ell N F -Hodge theater “•” under consideration.
This sort of intrinsic construction exhibits, in a very natural fashion,
the ind-topological monoids “Ok×μ ” of (aΘ ) and (aq ), the local formal monoids of
(bΘ ) and (bq ), and the global realiﬁed Frobenioids of (cΘ ) and (cq ) as Frobeniuslike objects.
By contrast,
the topological groups “Gk ” of (aΘ ) and (aq ) are étale-like objects.
In this context, it is useful to note — cf. the discussion of the vertical coricity of
D-Θ±ell N F -Hodge theaters in (vi) — that
the unit group portion data of (aΘ ), (aq ) is horizontally coric [cf. [IUTchIII],
Theorem 1.5, (ii)], while the portion of this data constituted by the topological
group “Gk ” is bi-coric [cf. [IUTchIII], Theorem 1.5, (iii)].
Indeed,
one way to think of Frobenius-like structures, in the context of the log-thetalattice, is as structures that, at least a priori, are conﬁned to — i.e., at least
a priori, are only deﬁned in — a ﬁxed Θ±ell N F -Hodge theater “•” of the
log-theta-lattice.

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

73

Here, we note that
since [just as in the case of the log-link — cf. the discussion in the ﬁnal portion
of (ii)!] the Θ-link is fundamentally incompatible with the ring structures in its domain and codomain, it is necessary to think of the bi-coric
topological group “Gk ” as being only well-deﬁned up to some indeterminate
isomorphism [cf. the discussion of §2.10; [IUTchIII], Remark 1.4.2, (i), (ii);
[IUTchIV], Remark 3.6.3, (i)].
Thus, in summary, the
Θ-link induces an isomorphism of the unit group portion data of (aΘ ),
(aq ), on the one hand, and a dilation, by a factor given by a sort of symmetrized
average of the j 2 , for j = 1, . . . , l , of the local and global value group data
of (bΘ ), (cΘ ), (bq ), (cq ), on the other.
The object, well-deﬁned up to isomorphism, of the global realiﬁed Frobenioid of (cΘ )
determined by the unique collection of generators of the local formal monoids of (bΘ )
at v ∈ Vbad will be referred to as the Θ-pilot object [cf. [IUTchI], Deﬁnition 3.8,
(i)]. In a similar vein, the object, well-deﬁned up to isomorphism, of the global realiﬁed
Frobenioid of (cq ) determined by the unique collection of generators of the local formal
monoids of (bq ) at v ∈ Vbad will be referred to as the q-pilot object [cf. [IUTchI],
Deﬁnition 3.8, (i)]. The Θ- and q-pilot objects play a central role in the main results of
inter-universal Teichmüller theory, which are the main topic of §3.7 below.
§ 3.4.

Kummer theory and multiradial decouplings/cyclotomic rigidity

The ﬁrst main result of inter-universal Teichmüller theory [cf. §3.7, (i)] consists of a
multiradial representation of the Θ-pilot objects discussed in §3.3, (vii). Relative
to the general discussion of multiradiality in §3.1, this multiradiality may be understood
as being with respect to the radial algorithm
(aΘ ), (bΘ ), (cΘ )

→

(aΘ )

that associates to the gluing data in the domain of the Θ-link the horizontally coric unit
group portion of this data [cf. the discussion of §3.3, (vii)]. The construction of this
multiradial representation of Θ-pilot objects consists of two steps. The ﬁrst step, which
we discuss in detail in the present §3.4, is the construction of multiradial cyclotomic
rigidity and decoupling algorithms for certain special types of functions on the
hyperbolic curves under consideration. The second step, which we discuss in detail in
§3.6 below, concerns the Galois evaluation at certain special points — i.e., evaluation
via Galois sections of arithmetic fundamental groups — of these functions to obtain
certain special values that act on processions of log-shells.

74

(i) The essential role of Kummer theory: We begin with the fundamental
observation that, despite the fact, for  ∈ {Θ, q}, the construction of the data (a )
(respectively, (b ); (c )) depends quite essentially on whether  = Θ or  = q, the
indeterminate gluing isomorphism that constitutes a Θ-link exists — i.e., the
data (aΘ ) (respectively, (bΘ ); (cΘ )) is indeed isomorphic to the data (aq ) (respectively,
(bq ); (cq )) — precisely as a consequence of the fact that we regard the [ind-topological]
monoids that occur in this data as abstract [ind-topological] monoids that are
not equipped with the auxiliary data of how these [ind-topological] monoids “happen
to be constructed”. That is to say, the inclusion of such auxiliary data would render
the corresponding portions of data in the domain and codomain of the Θ-link nonisomorphic! Such abstract [ind-topological] monoids are a sort of prototypical example
of the notion of a Frobenius-like structure [cf. [IUTchIV], Example 3.6, (iii)]. A similar
observation applies to the copies of “Ok ” that occur in the discussion of the log-link in
§3.3, (vi). Thus, in summary,
it is precisely by working with Frobenius-like structures such as abstract
[ind-topological] monoids or abstract [global realiﬁed] Frobenioids that we are
able to construct the non-ring/scheme-theoretic gluing isomorphisms
[i.e., “non-ring/scheme-theoretic” in the sense that they do not arise from morphisms of rings/schemes!] of the log- and Θ-links of §3.3, (vi), (vii) [cf. the
discussion of [IUTchII], Remark 3.6.2, (ii)].
By contrast,
étale-like structures such as the “Gk ’s” of (aΘ ) and (aq ) [cf. §3.3, (vii)]
or the “ΠX ’s” of §3.3, (vi), will be used to compute various portions of the
ring/scheme theory on the opposite side of a log- or Θ-link via the technique
of mono-anabelian transport, as discussed in §2.7, §2.9, i.e., by determining
the sort of indeterminacies that one must admit in order to render the two
systems of Kummer theories — which, we recall, are applied in order to relate
Frobenius-like structures to corresponding étale-like structures — in the
domain and codomain of the log- or Θ-link compatible with simultaneous
execution.
Here, we recall that Kummer classes are obtained, in essence, by considering cohomology
classes that arise from the action of various Galois or arithmetic fundamental groups
on the various roots of elements of an abstract monoid [cf. Examples 2.6.1, (iii); 2.12.1,
(i); 2.13.1, (i)]. Thus, the key step in rendering such Kummer classes independent
of any Frobenius-like structures lies in the algorithmic construction of a cyclotomic
rigidity isomorphism between the group of torsion elements of the abstract monoid
under consideration and some sort of étale-like cyclotome, i.e., that is constructed

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

75

directly from the Galois or arithmetic fundamental group under consideration [cf. the
isomorphism “λ” of Example 2.6.1, (iii), (iv); the isomorphism “ρμk ” of Example 2.12.1,
(i), (ii), (iv); the isomorphism “λ” of Example 2.13.1, (i), (ii)]. On the other hand, let
us observe, relative to the multiradiality mentioned at the beginning of the present
§3.4, that the coric data “Gk  Ok×μ ” admits a [nontrivial!] natural action by Z×
Ok×μ  Z×
[i.e., which is Gk -equivariant and compatible with the various integral structures that
appear in the coric data] that lifts to a natural Z× -action on Ok× [cf. Example 2.12.2,

(i)]. This Z× -action induces a trivial action of Z× on Gk [hence also on μk (Gk )], but
a nontrivial action of Z× on μk . In particular, this Z× -action on Ok× is manifestly
incompatible with the cyclotomic rigidity isomorphism
∼

ρμk : μk → μk (Gk )
that was functorially constructed in Example 2.12.1, (ii), hence, in light of the functoriality of this construction, does not extend to an action of Z× on Ok . That is to
say,
the naive approach just discussed to cyclotomic rigidity isomorphisms via
the functorial construction of Example 2.12.1, (ii), is incompatible with the
requirement of multiradiality, i.e., of the existence of liftings of arbitrary
morphisms between collections of coric data.
This discussion motivates the following approach, which is fundamental to inter-universal
Teichmüller theory [cf. the discussion of [IUTchIII], Remark 2.2.1, (iii); [IUTchIII], Remark 2.2.2]:
in order to obtain multiradial cyclotomic rigidity isomorphisms for the
local and global value group data (bΘ ) and (cΘ ), it is necessary to somehow
decouple this data (bΘ ) and (cΘ ) from the unit group data of (aΘ ).
This decoupling is achieved in inter-universal Teichmüller theory by working with certain
special types of functions, as described in (ii), (iii), (iv), below.
(ii) Multiradial decouplings/cyclotomic rigidity for κ-coric rational functions: The global realiﬁed Frobenioids of (cΘ ) may be interpreted as “realiﬁcations”
of certain categories of [l -tuples, indexed by j = 1, . . . , l , of ] arithmetic line bundles
on the number ﬁeld Fmod . The ring structure — i.e., both the additive “” and multiplicative “” structures — of copies of this number ﬁeld Fmod is applied, ultimately,
in inter-universal Teichmüller theory, in order to relate these global realiﬁed Frobenioids of (cΘ ), which are, in essence, a multiplicative notion, to the interpretation of

76

Shinichi Mochizuki

arithmetic line bundles in terms of log-shells, which are modules, i.e., whose group law
is written additively [cf. [IUTchIII], Remarks 3.6.2, 3.10.1] — an interpretation with
respect to which global arithmetic degrees correspond to log-volumes of certain regions
inside the various log-shells at each v ∈ V [cf. the discussion of §2.2]. Thus, in summary,
the essential structure of interest that gives rise to the data of (cΘ ) consists of
copies of the number ﬁeld Fmod indexed by j = 1, . . . , l .
In particular, the Kummer theory [cf. the discussion of (i)!] concerning the data of
(cΘ ) revolves around the Kummer theory of such copies of the number ﬁeld Fmod . As
discussed at the beginning of the present §3.4, elements of such copies of Fmod will be
constructed as special values at certain special points of certain special types of functions.
Here, it is perhaps of interest to recall that
this approach to constructing elements of the base ﬁeld [in this case, the number
ﬁeld Fmod ] of a hyperbolic curve — i.e., by evaluating Kummer classes of
rational functions on the hyperbolic curve at certain special points — is
precisely the approach that is in fact applied in the mono-anabelian reconstruction algorithms discussed in [AbsTopIII], §1.
As discussed at the beginning of the present §3.4 [cf. also the discussion of (i)], the ﬁrst
step in the construction of multiradial representations of Θ-pilot objects to be discussed
in §3.7, (i), consists of formulating the Kummer theory of suitable special types of
rational functions in such a way that we obtain multiradial cyclotomic rigidity
isomorphisms that involve a decoupling of this Kummer theory for rational functions
from the unit group data of (aΘ ). In the present case, i.e., which revolves around the
construction of copies of Fmod ,
the desired formulation of Kummer theory is achieved by considering a certain subset — called the pseudo-monoid of κ-coric rational functions [cf.
[IUTchI], Remark 3.1.7, (i), (ii)] — of the group [i.e., multiplicative monoid]
×
” considered in Example 2.13.1, in the case where the hyperbolic curve
“KX
“X” is taken to be the hyperbolic curve X K of §3.3, (i) [cf. [IUTchI], Remark
3.1.2, (ii)].
Recall the hyperbolic orbicurve CFmod discussed in §3.3, (i). Write |CFmod | for the coarse
space |CFmod | associated to CFmod . Here, it is useful to recall the well-known fact that
|CFmod | is isomorphic to the aﬃne line over L. We shall refer to the points of the
compactiﬁcation of |CFmod | that arise from the 2-torsion points of the elliptic curve EF
other than the origin as strictly critical. A κ-coric rational function is a rational
function on |CFmod | that
restricts to a root of unity at each strictly critical point of |CFmod |

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

77

and, moreover, satisﬁes certain other [somewhat less essential] technical conditions [cf.
[IUTchI], Remark 3.1.7, (i)]. Thus, a κ-coric rational function on |CFmod | may also be
regarded, by restriction, as a rational function on X K . Although the κ-coric rational
functions do not form a monoid [i.e., the product of two κ-coric rational functions is
not necessarily a κ-coric rational function], it nevertheless holds that arbitrary positive
powers of κ-coric rational functions are κ-coric. Moreover, every root of unity in Fmod
is κ-coric; a rational function on |CFmod | is κ-coric if and only if some positive power of
the rational function is κ-coric. One veriﬁes immediately that [despite the fact that the
κ-coric rational functions do not form a monoid] these elementary properties that are
satisﬁed by κ-coric rational functions are suﬃcient for conducting Kummer theory
with κ-coric rational functions. Then [cf. [IUTchI], Example 5.1, (v), for more details]:
· The desired decoupling of the pseudo-monoid of κ-coric rational functions
from the unit group data of (aΘ ) is achieved by means of the condition that
evaluation at any of the strictly critical points — an operation that may be
performed at the level of étale-like structures, i.e., by restricting Kummer
classes to decomposition groups of points — yields a root of unity.
· The desired multiradial cyclotomic rigidity isomorphism is achieved by
means of the technique discussed in Example 2.13.1, (ii) — i.e., involving the
elementary fact

Z× = {1}
Q>0
— which is applied to the pseudo-monoid of κ-coric rational functions, i.e., as
×
.
opposed to the entire multiplicative monoid KX
As was mentioned in Example 2.13.1, (ii), this approach has the disadvantage of being
incompatible with the proﬁnite topology of the Galois or arithmetic fundamental
groups involved [cf. the discussion of (iii) below; §3.6, (ii), below; [IUTchIII], Remark
2.3.3, (vii)]. Also, we remark that although this approach only allows one to reconstruct
the desired cyclotomic rigidity isomorphism up to multiplication by ±1, this will not
yield any problems since we are, in fact, only interested in reconstructing copies of the
×
, which is closed under inversion [cf. the discussion of
entire multiplicative monoid Fmod
[IUTchIII], Remark 2.3.3, (vi); [IUTchIII], Remark 3.11.4].
(iii) Naive approach to cyclotomic rigidity for theta functions: Fix v ∈
V . Denote by means of a subscript v the result of base-changing objects over K
to Kv . Thus, Xv is a “once-punctured Tate curve” over Kv , hence determines a onepointed stable curve of genus one Xv over the ring of integers OKv of Kv [where, for
simplicity, we omit the notation for the single marked point, which arises from the cusp
of Xv ]. In particular, the dual graph of the special ﬁber of Xv [i.e., more precisely: of Xv ]
is a “loop” [i.e., more precisely, consists of a single vertex and a single edge, both ends

of which abut to the single vertex]. In particular, the universal covering [in the sense of
classical algebraic topology!] of this dual graph determines [what is called] a tempered
covering Yv → Xv [i.e., at the level of models over OKv , a tempered covering Yv → Xv
def

— cf. [André], §4; [Semi], Example 3.10], whose Galois group Z = Gal(Yv /Xv ) is
noncanonically isomorphic to Z. Thus,
the special ﬁber of Yv [i.e., more precisely: of Yv ] consists of an inﬁnite chain
of copies of the “once-punctured/one-pointed projective line”, in which the
“punctures/cusps” correspond to the points “1” of the copies of the projective
line, and the point “∞” of each such copy is glued to the point “0” of the
adjacent copy [cf. the upper portion of Fig. 3.9 above; the discussion at the
beginning of [EtTh], §1; [IUTchII], Proposition 2.1; [IUTchII], Remark 2.1.1].
If one ﬁxes one such copy of the once-punctured projective line, together with an iso∼
morphism Z → Z, then the natural action of Z on Yv determines a natural bijection of
the set of irreducible components of the special ﬁber of Yv — or, alternatively, of the
set of cusps of Yv — with Z [cf. the “labels” of Fig. 3.9]. The “multiplication by 2”
endomorphism of the elliptic curve Ev [which may be thought of as the compactiﬁcation
of the aﬃne hyperbolic curve Xv ] determines, via base-change by Yv → Xv , a double
covering Ÿv → Yv [i.e., at the level of models over OKv , a double covering Ÿv → Yv ].
One veriﬁes immediately that the set of irreducible components of the special ﬁber of
Ÿv [i.e., more precisely: of Ÿv ] maps bijectively to the set of irreducible components of
the special ﬁber of Yv , while there exist precisely two cusps of Ÿv over each cusp of Yv .
The formal completion of Yv along the smooth locus [i.e., the complement of “0” and
“∞”] of the irreducible component of the special ﬁber labeled 0 is naturally isomorphic
∼
[in a fashion compatible with a choice of isomorphism Z → Z] to a once-punctured
copy of the multiplicative group “Gm ”. In particular, it makes sense to speak of the
standard multiplicative coordinate “Uv ” on this formal completion, as well as a square
root [well-deﬁned up to multiplication by ±1] “Üv ” of Uv on the base-change of this

irreducible component of the special ﬁber of Ÿ v that maps to the irreducible component
of the special ﬁber of Ÿv labeled 0]. Such points of Ÿ v are referred to as zero-labeled
evaluation points [cf., e.g., [IUTchII], Corollary 2.6]. At a very rough level,
the approach to multiradial decouplings/cyclotomic rigidity taken in the
case of the Kummer theory of special functions that surrounds the formal
monoid of (bΘ ) may be understood as being “roughly similar” to the approach
discussed in (ii) in the case of the global realiﬁed Frobenioids of (cΘ ), except
that “κ-coric rational functions” are replaced by [normalized reciprocals of l-th
roots of] theta functions.
[cf. the discussion of [IUTchII], Remark 1.1.1, (v); [IUTchIII], Remark 2.3.3]. That is
to say,
· The desired decoupling [which is referred to in [EtTh], as “constant multiple
rigidity”] of the [reciprocal of an l-th root of the] theta function from the unit
group data of (aΘ ) is achieved by means of the condition that evaluation
at any of the zero-labeled evaluation points — an operation that may be
performed at the level of étale-like structures, i.e., by restricting Kummer
classes to decomposition groups of points — yields a 2l-th root of unity.

80

· The desired multiradial cyclotomic rigidity isomorphism is, roughly
speaking, achieved by means of the “mod N Kummer class version”, for
various positive integers N , of the technique discussed in Example 2.13.1, (ii)
[cf., especially, the ﬁnal display of Example 2.13.1, (ii)]: that is to say, such a
“mod N version” is possible – without any {±1} indeterminacies! — precisely
as a consequence of the fact that the order of each zero of Θ̈v at each cusp of
Ÿv is precisely one [cf., e.g., the discussion of [IUTchIII], Remark 2.3.3, (vi)].
In this context, we remark that the decomposition groups of zero-labeled evaluation
points may be reconstructed by applying the theory of elliptic cuspidalizations developed in [AbsTopII], §3. This theory proceeds in an essentially parallel fashion to the
theory of Belyi cuspidalizations [cf. the discussion of §3.3, (vi)]. That is to say, elliptic
cuspidalizations are achieved as a formal consequence of the elementary observation that
the dense open subscheme of a once-punctured elliptic curve obtained by
removing the N -torsion points, for N a positive integer, may be regarded — via
the use of the “multiplication by N ” endomorphism of the elliptic curve! — as a
ﬁnite étale covering of the given once-punctured elliptic curve; in particular,
the arithmetic fundamental group of such a dense open subscheme may be
recovered from the arithmetic fundamental group of the given once-punctured
elliptic curve by considering a suitable open subgroup of the latter arithmetic
fundamental group [cf. [AbsTopII], Example 3.2; [AbsTopII], Corollaries 3.3,
3.4, for more details].
Another important observation in this context [cf. also §3.6, (ii), below; [IUTchIII],
Remark 2.3.3, (vii)] is that the approach to cyclotomic rigidity described above involving “mod N Kummer classes” is manifestly compatible with the topology of the
Galois or tempered arithmetic fundamental groups involved. Since this “mod N approach” depends, in an essential way, on the fact that the order of the zero of Θ̈v at
each cusp of Ÿv is precisely one [cf., the discussion of [IUTchIII], Remark 2.3.3, (vi)], it
also serves to elucidate the importance of working with the ﬁrst power of [reciprocals
of l-th roots of the] theta function, i.e., as opposed to the M -th power, for M ≥ 2 [cf.
[IUTchII], Remark 3.6.4, (iii), (iv); [IUTchIII], Remark 2.1.1, (iv); [IUTchIII], Remark
2.3.3, (vii)]. On the other hand, the approach described thus far in the present (iii)
has one fundamental deﬁciency, namely, the fact that the orders of the poles of Θ̈v
are not compatible/symmetric with respect to the action of Z on Yv [cf. Fig. 3.9]
implies that
the approach described thus far in the present (iii) to multiradial cyclotomic
rigidity — i.e., involving, in eﬀect, the mod N Kummer classes of the
[reciprocal of an l-th root of the] theta function — is not compatible with

81

the Z-symmetries of Yv [cf. the discussion of [IUTchII], Remark 1.1.1, (v);
[IUTchIII], Remark 2.3.3, (iv)].

Here, we note that the quotient Z → Z  Z/l · Z = Fl may be identiﬁed with the
in the discussion of symmetries of Θ±ell N F -Hodge theaters in §3.3,
subgroup Fl ⊆ F±

(v). Also, we remark that the mod N Kummer class of the reciprocal of an l-th root of
the theta function is indeed compatible with the N · l · Z-symmetries of Yv . This
means that, as one varies N , the obstruction to ﬁnding a coherent system of basepoints
— i.e., a coherent notion of the “zero label” — of the resulting projective system lies
in

[cf. the discussion of [EtTh], Remark 2.16.1]. Put another way, one may only construct
a coherent system of basepoints if one is willing to replace Z by its proﬁnite completion, i.e., to sacriﬁce the discrete nature of Z (∼
= Z). It is for this reason that the
property of compatibility with, say, the l · Z-symmetries of Yv is referred to, in [EtTh],
as discrete rigidity. This sort of discrete rigidity plays an important role in interuniversal Teichmüller theory since a failure of discrete rigidity would obligate one to
work with Z-multiples/powers of divisors, line bundles, or meromorphic functions —
a state of aﬀairs that would, for instance, obligate one to sacriﬁce the crucial notion of
positivity/ampleness in discussions of divisors and line bundles [cf. the discussion of
[IUTchIII], Remark 2.1.1, (v)].
(iv) Cyclotomic, discrete, and constant multiple rigidity for mono-theta
environments: The incompatibility of the approach discussed in (iii) with Z-symmetries [cf. the discussion at the end of (iii)] is remedied in the theory of [EtTh] by working
with mono-theta environments, as follows: Write LXv for the ample line bundle of
degree 1 on Xv determined by the unique marked point of Xv and

for the various pull-backs, or restrictions, of LXv . Then the theta function Θ̈v on Ÿv
may be thought of as a ratio of two sections of the line bundle L̈v over Ÿv , which may
be described as follows:
· The algebraic section of L̈v is the section [well-deﬁned up to a Kv× -multiple]
whose zero locus coincides with the locus of zeroes of Θ̈v . The pair consisting
of the line bundle Lv and this algebraic section admits Z-symmetries [cf. Fig.
3.9], i.e., automorphisms that lie over the automorphisms of Z = Gal(Yv /Xv ).
· The theta section of L̈v is the section [well-deﬁned up to a Kv× -multiple]

Shinichi Mochizuki

82

whose zero locus coincides with the locus of poles of Θ̈v . One veriﬁes immediately [cf. Fig. 3.9] that the theta section is not compatible with the
Z-symmetries of the algebraic section.
The analogous operation, for this line bundle-theoretic data, to considering various Kummer classes of the theta function is the operation of passing to the tempered arithmetic fundamental group of the Gm -torsor L×
v associated to Lv or to the morphisms
on tempered arithmetic fundamental groups induced by the algebraic and theta sections.
Here, “mod N Kummer classes” correspond to considering the quotient of the tempered
arithmetic fundamental group of L×
v that corresponds to coverings whose restriction to
the “Gm ﬁbers” of the Gm -torsor L×
v is dominated by the covering Gm → Gm given by
raising to N -th power. Note that
neither the ratio of the algebraic and theta sections — i.e., the theta function! — nor the pair consisting of the algebraic and theta sections is compatible with the Z-symmetries of Yv .
On the other hand, it is not diﬃcult to verify that the following triple of data is indeed
compatible, up to isomorphism, with the Z-symmetries of Yv :
(aμ−Θ ) the Gm -torsor L×
v;
×
(bμ−Θ ) the group of automorphisms of L×
v generated by the Z-symmetries of Lv and
the automorphisms determined by multiplication by a constant ∈ Kv× ;
def

×
(cμ−Θ ) the theta section of L̈×
v = Lv |Ÿv .

Indeed, the asserted compatibility with the Z-symmetries of Yv is immediate for (aμ−Θ )
and (bμ−Θ ). On the other hand, with regard to (cμ−Θ ), a direct calculation shows that
application of a Z-symmetry has the eﬀect of multiplying the theta section by some
1
meromorphic function which is a product of integer powers of Üv and qv2 ; moreover, a
direct calculation shows that the group of automorphisms of (bμ−Θ ) is stabilized by conjugation by the operation of multiplying by such a meromorphic function. That is to say,
by applying such multiplication operations, we conclude that the triple of data (aμ−Θ ),
(bμ−Θ ), (cμ−Θ ) is indeed compatible, up to isomorphism, with the Z-symmetries of
Yv , as desired [cf. [EtTh], Proposition 2.14, (ii), (iii), for more details]. This argument
motivates the following deﬁnition [cf. the discussion of [IUTchIII], Remark 2.3.4]:
The [mod N ] mono-theta environment is deﬁned by considering the [mod
N ] tempered arithmetic fundamental group versions of the “l-th roots” of the
triple of data (aμ−Θ ), (bμ−Θ ), (cμ−Θ ) discussed above [cf. [EtTh], Deﬁnition
2.13, (ii)].

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

83

[Indeed, the data (aμ−Θ ), (bμ−Θ ), (cμ−Θ ) correspond, respectively, to the data of [EtTh],
Deﬁnition 2.13, (ii), (a), (b), (c).] In particular, the functoriality of the tempered
arithmetic fundamental group [essentially — cf. [EtTh], Proposition 2.14, (ii), (iii), for
more details] implies that a mono-theta environment admits l · Z-symmetries of
the desired type, hence, in particular, that it satisﬁes the crucial property of discrete
rigidity discussed in the ﬁnal portion of (iii). Moreover, by forming suitable commutators in the group of automorphisms of L×
v , one may recover the desired cyclotomic
rigidity isomorphism [cf. [EtTh], Corollary 2.19, (i); [IUTchII], Remark 1.1.1, for
more details], i.e., that was discussed in a “rough form” in (iii), in a fashion that is
· decoupled from the unit group data of (aΘ ),
· manifestly compatible with the topology of the tempered arithmetic fundamental groups involved [since one works with “mod N ” mono-theta environments!], and
±ell
N F -Hodge theaters [cf. §3.3,
· compatible with the F±
l -symmetries of Θ
(v); [IUTchII], Remark 1.1.1, (iv), (v)].
Indeed, these multiradial decoupling/cyclotomic rigidity properties of mono-theta
environments are the main topic of [IUTchII], §1, and are summarized in [IUTchII],
Corollaries 1.10, 1.12. Moreover, mono-theta environments have both étale-like and
Frobenius-like versions, i.e., they may be constructed naturally [cf. [IUTchII], Proposition 1.2, (i), (ii)] either
· from the tempered arithmetic fundamental group [regarded as an abstract topological group!] of X v , or
· from a certain “tempered Frobenioid”, i.e., a model Frobenioid [cf. §3.3,
(iii)] obtained by considering suitable divisors, line bundles, and meromorphic
functions on the various tempered coverings of X v .
Finally, we close with the important observation that the various rigidity properties of
mono-theta environments discussed above may be regarded as
essentially formal consequences of the quadratic structure of the commutators of the theta groups — or, equivalently, of the curvature, or ﬁrst
Chern class — associated to the line bundle LXv
[cf. the discussion of [IUTchII], Remark 1.1.1, (iv), (v); [IUTchIII], Remark 2.1.1]. This
observation is of interest in that it shows that the theory of [EtTh] [or, indeed, a substantial portion of inter-universal Teichmüller theory!] yields an interesting alternative
interpretation for the structure of theta groups to the classical representationtheoretic interpretation, i.e., involving irreducible representations of theta groups [cf.
[IUTchIII], Remark 2.3.4, (iv)].

(v) Various approaches to cyclotomic rigidity: The discussion in the present
§3.4 of various properties of the three approaches to cyclotomic rigidity that appear in
inter-universal Teichmüller theory is summarized in Fig. 3.10 above. The most naive approach, involving well-known properties from local class ﬁeld theory applied to the data
“Gk  Ok ” [cf. Example 2.12.1, (ii), (iii), (iv)], is compatible with the proﬁnite
topology of the Galois or arithmetic fundamental groups involved, but suﬀers from the
fundamental defect of being uniradial, i.e., of being “un-decouplable” from the unit
group data of (aΘ ) [cf. the discussion of (i)]. By contrast, the approaches discussed in
(ii) and (iv) involving κ-coric rational functions and mono-theta environments
satisfy the crucial requirement of multiradiality, i.e., of being “decouplable” from
the unit group data of (aΘ ). The approach via mono-theta environments also satisﬁes the
important property of being compatible with the topology of the tempered arithmetic
fundamental groups involved. By contrast, the approach via κ-coric rational functions
is not compatible with the proﬁnite topology of the Galois or arithmetic fundamental
groups involved. This incompatibility in the case of the Kummer theory surrounding
the global data of (cΘ ) will not, however, pose a problem, since compatibility with the
topologies of the various Galois or [possibly tempered] arithmetic fundamental groups
involved will only be of interest in the case of the Kummer theory surrounding the local
data of (aΘ ) and (bΘ ) [cf. §3.6, (ii), below; [IUTchIII], Remark 2.3.3, (vii), (viii)].
§ 3.5.

Remarks on the use of Frobenioids

The theory of Frobenioids was developed in [FrdI], [FrdII] as a
solution to the problem of providing a uniﬁed, intrinsic category-theoretic
characterization of various types of categories of line bundles and divisors that
frequently appeared in the author’s research on the arithmetic of hyperbolic
curves and, moreover, seemed, at least from a heuristic point of view, to be
remarkably similar in structure.
These papers [FrdI], [FrdII] on Frobenioids were written in the spring of 2005, when
the author only had a relatively rough, sketchy idea of how to formulate inter-universal
Teichmüller theory. In particular,
anyone who reads these papers [FrdI], [FrdII] — or indeed, the Frobenioidtheoretic portion of [EtTh] — under the expectation that they were written
as an optimally eﬃcient presentation of precisely those portions of the theory
of Frobenioids that are actually used in inter-universal Teichmüller theory will
undoubtedly be disappointed.
In light of this state of aﬀairs, it seems appropriate to pause at this point to make a few
remarks on the use of Frobenioids in inter-universal Teichmüller theory. First of all,

Shinichi Mochizuki

86

· at v ∈ Varc , the [“archimedean”] Frobenioids that appear in inter-universal
Teichmüller theory [cf. [IUTchI], Example 3.4] are essentially equivalent to the
topological monoid OC [i.e., the multiplicative topological monoid of nonzero
complex numbers of norm ≤ 1] and hence may be ignored.
On the other hand,
· at v ∈ Vnon , all of the [“nonarchimedean”] Frobenioids that appear in
inter-universal Teichmüller theory [cf., e.g., [IUTchI], Fig. I1.2] — except for
the tempered Frobenioids mentioned in §3.4, (iv)! — are essentially equivalent
to either the data [consisting of an abstract ind-topological monoid equipped
with a continuous action by an abstract topological group]
“Gk  Ok ”
of Example 2.12.1, (i), or the data [consisting of an abstract ind-topological
monoid equipped with a continuous action by an abstract topological group]
“ΠX  Ok ”
of Example 2.12.3, (ii) [where ΠX is possibly replaced by the tempered arithmetic fundamental group of X], or the data obtained from one of these two
types of data by replacing “Ok ” by some subquotient of “Ok ” [as in Example
2.12.2, (i), (ii)].
Moreover, all of these “nonarchimedean” Frobenioids are model Frobenioids [cf. the
discussion of §3.3, (iii)]. The only other types of Frobenioids — all of which are model
Frobenioids [cf. the discussion of §3.3, (iii)] — that appear in inter-universal Teichmüller theory are
· the [possibly realiﬁed] global Frobenioids associated to NF’s [cf. the discussion of §3.4, (ii)], which admit a simple elementary description as categories
of arithmetic line bundles on NF’s [cf. [FrdI], Example 6.3; [IUTchIII], Example
3.6; [Fsk], §2.10, (i), (ii)];
· the tempered Frobenioids mentioned in §3.4, (iv).
Here, we note that
these last two examples — i.e., global Frobenioids and tempered Frobenioids —
diﬀer fundamentally from the previous examples, which were essentially equivalent to an ind-topological monoid that was, in some cases, equipped with a continuous action by a topological group, in that their Picard groups [cf. [FrdI],
Theorem 5.1] admit non-torsion elements.

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

87

Indeed, global Frobenioids contain objects corresponding to arithmetic line bundles
whose arithmetic degree is = 0, while tempered Frobenioids contain objects corresponding to line bundles for which arbitrary positive tensor powers are nontrivial such as
[strictly speaking, the pull-back to Ÿ v of] the line bundle “Lv ” of §3.4, (iv). Finally, we
remark that although the theory of tempered Frobenioids, which is developed in [EtTh],
§3, §4, §5, is somewhat complicated, the only portions of these tempered Frobenioids that
are actually used in inter-universal Teichmüller theory are the portions discussed in §3.4,
(iii), (iv), i.e.,
(at−F ) the “theta monoids” generated by local units [i.e., “O× ”] and nonnegative
powers of roots of the [reciprocals of l-th roots of] theta functions that are constructed from tempered Frobenioids [cf. [IUTchI], Example 3.2; [IUTchII], Example
3.2, (i)];
(bt−F ) the mono-theta environments constructed from tempered Frobenioids [cf.
[IUTchII], Proposition 1.2, (ii)], which are related to the monoids of (at−F ), in that
they share the same submonoids of roots of unity.
Indeed, étale-like versions of this “essential Frobenius-like data” of (at−F ) and (bt−F )
are discussed in [IUTchII], Corollaries 1.10, 1.12; [IUTchIII], Theorem 2.2, (ii) [cf. the
data “(av ), (bv ), (cv ), (dv )” of loc. cit.]. Thus, from the point of view of studying
inter-universal Teichmüller theory,
one may essentially omit the detailed study of [EtTh], §3, §4, §5, either by
accepting the construction of the data (at−F ) and (bt−F ) “on faith” or by regarding this data as data constructed from the scheme-theoretic objects discussed
in [EtTh], §1, §2.
§ 3.6.

Galois evaluation, labels, symmetries, and log-shells

In the present §3.6, we discuss the theory of Galois evaluation of the κ-coric
rational functions and theta functions of §3.4, (ii), (iii). Here, we remark that the
term “Galois evaluation” refers to the passage

by ﬁrst passing from Frobenius-like — that is to say, in essence, [pseudo-]monoidtheoretic — versions of these functions [cf. the discussion of §3.4, (ii), (iii); §3.5] to
étale-like versions of these functions via various forms of Kummer theory as discussed in §3.4, (ii), (iii), then evaluating these étale-like functions by restricting
them to decomposition subgroups [that, say, arise from closed points of the curve under
consideration] of the [possibly tempered] arithmetic fundamental group under consideration to obtain étale-like versions of the values of interest, and ﬁnally applying the

Kummer theory of the constant base ﬁeld [i.e., as discussed in Example 2.12.1] to
obtain Frobenius-like versions of the values of interest [cf. Fig. 3.11 below; [IUTchII],
Remark 1.12.4]. In fact, it is essentially a tautology that the only way to construct
an assignment “abstract functions → values” that is compatible with the operation of
forming Kummer classes is precisely by applying [some variant of] this technique of
Galois evaluation [cf. the discussion of [IUTchII], Remark 1.12.4]. Moreover, it is interesting in this context to observe [cf. the discussion of [IUTchII], Remark 1.12.4] that the
well-known Section Conjecture of anabelian geometry — which, at least historically,
was expected to be related to diophantine geometry [cf. the discussion of [IUTchI], §I5]
— suggests strongly that, when one applies the technique of Galois evaluation, in fact,
the only suitable subgroups of the [possibly tempered] arithmetic fundamental group under consideration for the operation of “evaluation” are precisely
the decomposition subgroups that arise from the closed points of the curve
under consideration!
From this point of view, it is also of interest to observe that, in the context of the
evaluation of theta functions at torsion points [cf. (ii) below], it will be necessary to
apply a certain “combinatorial version of the Section Conjecture” [cf. [IUTchI],
Remark 2.5.1; the proof of [IUTchII], Corollary 2.4, (i)]. Finally, we remark that, in
order to give a precise description of the Galois evaluation operations that are performed
in inter-universal Teichmüller theory, it will be necessary to consider, in substantial
detail,
· the labels of the points at which the functions are to be evaluated [i.e., the
points that give rise to the decomposition subgroups mentioned above],
· the symmetries that act on these labels [cf. §3.3, (v)], and
· the log-shells that serve as containers for the values that are constructed.
(i) Passage to the étale-picture, combinatorial uni-/multiradiality of
symmetries:
Recall from the discussion of §3.3, (vi), that the D-Θ±ell N F -Hodge
theaters associated to the Θ±ell N F -Hodge theaters “•” in the log-theta-lattice are vertically coric. That is to say, one may think of a D-Θ±ell N F -Hodge theater, considered
up to an indeterminate isomorphism, as an invariant of each vertical line of the
log-theta-lattice. Moreover, the étale-like portion [i.e., the “Gv ’s”] of the data of (aΘ ),
or, equivalently, (aq ), of §3.3, (vii), again considered up to an indeterminate isomorphism, may be thought of as an object constructed from the D-Θ±ell N F -Hodge theater
associated to the Θ±ell N F -Hodge theater “•” under consideration. In particular,
if one takes the radial data to consist of the D-Θ±ell N F -Hodge theater associated to some vertical line of the log-theta-lattice [considered up to an indeterminate isomorphism!], the coric data to consist of the étale-like portion

[again considered up to an indeterminate isomorphism!] of the data of (aΘ ), or,
equivalently, (aq ), of §3.3, (vii), and the radial algorithm to be the assignment
[i.e., “construction”] of the above discussion, then one obtains a radial environment, shown in Fig. 3.12 below, that is [“tautologically”!] multiradial [cf.
[IUTchII], Corollary 4.11; [IUTchII], Fig. 4.3].
[Indeed, this multiradial environment may be thought of as being simply a slightly more
complicated version of the multiradial environment of Example 3.2.2, (ii).] The diagram
obtained by including, in the diagram of Fig. 3.12, not just two collections of radial data
[that arise, say, from two adjacent vertical lines of the log-theta-lattice], but rather the
collections of radial data that arise from all of the vertical lines of the log-theta-lattice
is referred to as the étale-picture [cf. [IUTchII], Fig. 4.3]. Despite its tautological
nature,
the multiradiality — i.e., permutability of D-Θ±ell N F -Hodge theaters associated to distinct vertical lines of the log-theta-lattice — of the étalepicture is nonetheless somewhat remarkable since [prior to passage to the
étale-picture!] the log-theta-lattice does not admit symmetries that permute
distinct vertical lines of the log-theta-lattice.

Next, we consider the respective F±
l - and Fl -symmetries of the constituent DΘ±ell N F -Hodge theaters [cf. §3.3, (v)]. In this context, it is useful to introduce symbols “” and “>”:

· “” denotes the entire set Fl that appears in the discussion of Fig. 3.8 in
§3.3, (v), i.e., the notation “[. . .]” in the upper left-hand corner of Fig. 3.8 [cf.
[IUTchI], Fig. 6.5].

Fig. 3.14: Combinatorial uniradiality of F±
l -symmetries
If one extracts from the étale-picture the various F
l -symmetries of the respective D±ell
Θ N F -Hodge theaters, then one obtains a diagram as in Fig. 3.13 above, i.e., a
diagram of various distinct, independent F
l -actions that are “glued together at a
common symbol 0” [cf. the discussion of [IUTchII], Remark 4.7.4; [IUTchII], Fig. 4.2].
This diagram may be thought of as a sort of combinatorial prototype for the phenomenon of multiradiality. On the other hand, if one extracts from the étale-picture
±ell
N F -Hodge theaters, then one
the various F±
l -symmetries of the respective D-Θ
obtains a diagram as in Fig. 3.14 above, i.e., a diagram of various mutually interfering F±
l -actions that interfere with one another as a consequence of the fact that they
are “glued together at a common symbol 0” [cf. the discussion of [IUTchII], Remark
4.7.4; [IUTchII], Fig. 4.1]. This diagram may be thought of as a sort of combinatorial
prototype for the phenomenon of uniradiality. Finally, in this context, it is also of
interest to observe that, if, in accordance with the point of view of the discussion of
§2.14,
one thinks of Fl as a sort of ﬁnite discrete approximation of “Z” [cf.
[IUTchI], Remark 6.12.3, (i); [IUTchII], Remark 4.7.3, (i)],
and one thinks “Z” as the value group of the various completions [say, for simplicity,
at v ∈ Vnon ] of K, then
the F
l -symmetry corresponds to a symmetry that only involves the non-unit
portions of these value groups at various v ∈ Vnon , while the F±
l -symmetry

92

is a symmetry that involves a sort of “juggling” between local unit groups and
local value groups.
This point of view is consistent with the fact [cf. (iii) below; Example 2.12.3, (v);
§3.3, (ii), (vii); §3.4, (ii)] that the F
l -symmetry is related only to the Kummer theory
surrounding the global value group data (cΘ ), while [cf. (ii) below; Example 2.12.3,
(v); §3.3, (ii), (vii); §3.4, (iii), (iv)] the F±
l -symmetry is related to both the [local]
Θ
unit group data (a ) and the local value group data (bΘ ), which are “juggled”
about by the log-links of the log-theta-lattice.

v arise
from K-linear automorphisms of the hyperbolic curve X K [cf. the discussion of §3.3,
(v); [IUTchII], Corollary 2.4, (iii)], let us observe that
the outer automorphisms of Π±
v under consideration may, in fact, be thought
±
of as Δ±
v -outer automorphisms of Πv [i.e., automorphisms deﬁned up to
composition with an inner automorphism induced by conjugation by an element

of Δ±
v ] induced by conjugation by elements of Δv .
Next, let us recall from the discussion of §3.3, (v), concerning the F±
l -symmetry that
±
elements of Fl may be thought of — up to Fl -indeterminacies that may in fact,
as a consequence of the structure of a Θ±ell N F -Hodge theater, be synchronized in a
fashion that is independent of the choice of v ∈ Vbad [cf. [IUTchI], Remark 6.12.4, (i),
(ii), (iii)] — as labels of cusps of X v . Moreover, such cusps of X v may be thought of,
by applying a suitable functorial group-theoretic algorithm, as certain conjugacy classes
of subgroups [i.e., cuspidal inertia subgroups] of Π±
v [cf. [IUTchI], Deﬁnition 6.1, (iii)].
In particular, the above observation implies that, if we think of Gv as a quotient of one

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

93

cor
of the tempered arithmetic fundamental groups Πv , Π±
discussed above, and we
v , Πv
consider copies of this quotient Gv equipped with labels

(Gv )t
— where we think of t ∈ Fl as a conjugacy class of cuspidal inertia subgroups of Π±
v —
then
cor
the action of the F±
l -symmetry [i.e., by conjugation in Πv ] on these labeled
quotients {(Gv )t }t∈Fl induces symmetrizing isomorphisms between these
labeled quotients that are free of any inner automorphism indeterminacies [cf. [IUTchII], Corollary 3.5, (i); [IUTchII], Remark 3.5.2, (iii); [IUTchII],
Remark 4.5.3, (i)].

The existence of these symmetrizing isomorphisms is a phenomenon that is sometimes
referred to as conjugate synchronization. Note that this sort of situation diﬀers
radically from the situation that arises for the isomorphisms induced by conjugation
def
in GK = Gal(F /K) between the various decomposition groups of v [that is to say,
copies of “Gv ”], i.e., isomorphisms which are only well-deﬁned up to composition with
some indeterminate inner automorphism of the decomposition group under consideration [cf. the discussion of [IUTchII], Remark 2.5.2, (iii)]. Relative to the theme of
“synchronization”, another important role played by the F±
l -symmetry is the role of
synchronizing the ±-indeterminacies that occur at the portions labeled by various
valuations ∈ V on the “left-hand side” [cf. Fig. 3.8] of a Θ±ell N F -Hodge theater [cf.
[IUTchII], Remark 4.5.3, (iii)]. In this context, since tempered arithmetic fundamental
groups, unlike conventional proﬁnite étale fundamental groups, are only deﬁned at a
speciﬁc v ∈ Vbad , one technical issue that arises, when one considers the task of relating
the symmetrizing isomorphisms discussed above at diﬀerent v ∈ Vbad [or, indeed, to the
theory at valuations ∈ Vgood ] is
the issue of comparing tempered and proﬁnite conjugacy classes of various
types of subgroups [i.e., such as cuspidal inertia groups] — an issue that is
resolved [cf. the application of [IUTchI], Corollary 2.5, in the proof of [IUTchII],
Corollary 2.4] by applying the theory of [Semi].
The symmetrizing isomorphisms discussed above may be applied not only to copies of
the étale-like object Gv but also to various Frobenius-like objects that are “closely related” to Gv [cf. the pairs “Gk  Ok ” of Example 2.12.1; [IUTchII], Corollary 3.6, (i)].
Moreover, an analogous theory of symmetrizing isomorphisms may be developed at valuations ∈ Vgood [cf. [IUTchII], Corollary 4.5, (iii); [IUTchII], Corollary 4.6, (iii)]. The
graphs, or diagonals, of these symmetrizing isomorphisms at various valuations ∈ V

Shinichi Mochizuki

94

may be thought of as corresponding to the symbol “” discussed in (i), or indeed, after
applying the gluing that appears in the structure of a Θ±ell N F -Hodge theater [cf. (i);
§3.3, (v)], to the symbols “0”, “>” [cf. [IUTchII], Corollary 3.5, (iii); [IUTchII], Corollary 3.6, (iii); [IUTchII], Corollary 4.5, (iii); [IUTchII], Corollary 4.6, (iii); [IUTchII],
Corollary 4.10, (i)]. Moreover,
the data labeled by these symbols “”, “0”, “>”, form the data that is ultimately actually used in the horizontally coric unit group portion (aΘ ),
(aq ) [cf. §3.3, (vii)] of the data in the codomain and domain of the Θ-link [cf.
[IUTchIII], Theorem 1.5, (iii)].
The signiﬁcance of this approach to constructing the data of (aΘ ), (aq ) lies in the fact
that the “descent” [cf. [IUTchIII], Remark 1.5.1, (i)] from the individual labels
t ∈ Fl to the symbols “”/“0”/“>” that is eﬀected by the various symmetrizing
isomorphisms gives rise to horizontally coric data — i.e., data that is shared by
the codomain and domain of the Θ-link — that serves as a container [cf. the discussion
of (iv) below] for the various theta values [well-deﬁned up to multiplication by a 2l-th
root of unity]

Finally, we remark that the Kummer theory that relates the corresponding étale-like
and Frobenius-like data that appears in the various symmetrizing isomorphisms just
discussed only involves local data, i.e., the data of (aΘ ) and (bΘ ), hence [cf. the discussion of §3.4, (v); Fig. 3.10] is compatible with the topologies of the various tempered
or proﬁnite Galois or arithmetic fundamental groups involved. The signiﬁcance of this
compatibility with topologies lies in the fact it means that the Kummer isomorphisms
that appear may be computed relative to some ﬁnite étale covering of the schemes
involved, i.e., relative to a situation in which — unlike the situation that arises if one
considers some sort of projective limit of multiplicative monoids associated to rings
— the ring structure of the schemes involved is still intact. That is to say, since the
log-link is deﬁned by applying the formal power series of the natural logarithm, an
object that can only be deﬁned if both the additive and the multiplicative structures of
the [topological] rings involved are available,
this computability allows one to compare — hence to establish the compatibility of — the various symmetrizing isomorphisms just discussed in
the codomain and domain of the log-link [cf. [IUTchII], Remark 3.6.4, (i);
[IUTchIII], Remark 1.3.2; the discussion of Step (vi) of the proof of [IUTchIII],
Corollary 3.12].
This compatibility plays an important role in inter-universal Teichmüller theory.
(iii) Number ﬁeld values and global diagonals via the F
l -symmetry: We
begin by considering certain ﬁeld extensions of the ﬁeld Fmod : write
· Fsol ⊆ F for the maximal solvable extension of Fmod in F [cf. [IUTchI],
Deﬁnition 3.1, (b)];
· F (μl , CF ) for the ﬁeld obtained by adjoining to the function ﬁeld of CF the
l-th roots of unity [cf. the ﬁeld “F (μl ) · LC ” of [IUTchI], Remark 3.1.7, (iii)];
· F (μl , κ-sol) for the ﬁeld obtained by adjoining to F (μl , CF ) arbitrary roots of
Fsol -multiples of κ-coric rational functions [cf. §3.4, (ii)] in F (μl , CF ) [cf. the
ﬁeld “F (μl ) · LC (κ-sol)” of [IUTchI], Remark 3.1.7, (iii)];
· F (C K ) for the Galois closure over the ﬁeld F (μl , CF ) of the function ﬁeld of
C K [cf. the ﬁeld “LC (C K )” of [IUTchI], Remark 3.1.7, (iii)].
Then one veriﬁes immediately, by applying the fact that the ﬁnite group SL2 (Fl ) [where
we recall from §3.3, (i), that l ≥ 5] is perfect, that
F (μl , κ-sol) and F (C K ) are linearly disjoint over F (μl , CF ) [cf. [IUTchI],
Remark 3.1.7, (iii)].
It then follows, in an essentially formal way, from this linear disjointness [cf. [IUTchI],

Shinichi Mochizuki

96

Remark 3.1.7, (ii), (iii); [IUTchI], Example 5.1, (i), (v); [IUTchI], Remark 5.1.5; [IUTchII],
Corollary 4.7, (i), (ii); [IUTchII], Corollary 4.8, (i), (ii)] that:
· the various elements in
Fmod or Fsol
may be obtained by Galois evaluation, i.e., by restricting the Kummer
classes of the κ-coric rational functions discussed in §3.4, (ii), to the various
decomposition groups that arise, respectively, from Fmod - or Fsol -rational
points;
· this construction of Fmod or Fsol via Galois evaluation may be done in a fashion

that is compatible with the labels ∈ F
l and the Fl -symmetry that appear
in a Θ±ell N F -Hodge theater [cf. the discussion of §3.3, (v); the right-hand
side of Fig. 3.8];
· in particular, this compatibility with labels and the F
l -symmetry induces
symmetrizing isomorphisms between copies of Fmod or Fsol that determine
graphs, or diagonals, which may be thought of as corresponding to the symbol “>” [cf. the discussion of (i), (ii)].
In this context, we note that this approach to constructing elements of NF’s by restricting Kummer classes of rational functions on hyperbolic curves to decomposition
groups of points deﬁned over an NF is precisely the approach taken in the functorial
algorithms of [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9 [cf., especially, [AbsTopIII], Theorem 1.9, (d)].
Also, we observe that, although much of the above discussion runs in a somewhat parallel fashion to the discussion in (ii) of the F±
l -symmetry and the construction of theta
values via Galois evaluation, there are important diﬀerences, as well, between the
theta and NF cases [cf. [IUTchIII], Remark 2.3.3]:
· First of all, the symmetrizing isomorphisms/diagonals associated to the
F
l -symmetry are not compatible with the symmetrizing isomorphisms/diagonals
associated to the F±
l -symmetry, except on the respective restrictions of these
two collections of symmetrizing isomorphisms to copies of Fmod [cf. [IUTchII],
Remark 4.7.2]. Moreover, for various technical reasons related to conjugate
synchronization, it is of fundamental importance in the theory to isolate the
±
F
l -symmetry from the Fl -symmetry [cf. the discussion of [IUTchII], Remarks
2.6.2, 4.7.3, 4.7.5, 4.7.6].
· Unlike the Kummer theory applied in the theta case, the Kummer theory
applied in the NF case is not compatible with the topologies of the various
proﬁnite Galois or arithmetic fundamental groups that appear [cf. the discussion of §3.4, (v)]. On the other hand, this will not cause any problems since

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

97

there is no issue, in the NF case, of applying formal power series such as the
power series of the natural logarithm [cf. the ﬁnal portion of the discussion of
(ii); [IUTchIII], Remark 2.3.3, (vii), (viii)].
· In the Galois evaluation applied in the theta case, one is concerned with constructing, at a level where the arithmetic holomorphic structure [i.e., the
ring structure] is still intact, theta values that depend, in an essential way,
on the label “j”. By contrast, in the Galois evaluation applied in the NF case,
one only constructs, at such a level where the arithmetic holomorphic structure
×
is still intact, the totality of [various copies of] the multiplicative monoid Fmod
associated to the number ﬁeld Fmod : that is to say, a dependence on the label
“j” only appears at the level of the mono-analytic structures constituted by
the global realiﬁed Frobenioids of (cΘ ), i.e., in the form of a sort of ratio,
or weight, “j 2 ” [cf. the fourth display of [IUTchII], Corollary 4.5, (v)] between
the arithmetic degrees at the label “j” and the arithmetic degrees at the label
“1” [cf. [IUTchIII], Remark 2.3.3, (iii); [IUTchIII], Remark 3.11.4, (i)].
In the context of this ﬁnal diﬀerence between the theta and NF cases, it is perhaps of

)j (⊆ Fmod

is
interest to observe that a similar sort of “weighted copy” (Fmod
not possible at the level of arithmetic holomorphic structures [that is to say, in
the sense that it is not compatible with the additive interpretation of line bundles, i.e., in

terms of modules] since this “weighted copy” (Fmod
addition [cf. the discussion of the ﬁnal portion of §3.3, (iv); [AbsTopIII], Remark
5.10.2, (iv)].
(iv) Actions on log-shells: At this point, the reader may have noticed two apparent shortcomings [which are, in fact, closely related!] in the theory of Galois evaluation developed thus far in the present §3.6:
· Unlike the case with the Kummer theory of κ-coric rational functions and theta
functions/mono-theta environments discussed in §3.4, the discussion of Galois
evaluation given above does not mention any multiradiality properties.
· Ultimately, one is interested in relating [the Kummer theory surrounding]
Frobenius-like structures — such as the theta values and copies of NF’s that
arise from Galois evaluation — in the domain of the Θ-link to [the Kummer
theory surrounding] Frobenius-like structures in the codomain of the Θ-link,
i.e., in accordance with the discussion of the technique of mono-anabelian
transport in §2.7, §2.9. On the other hand, since the theta values and copies
of NF’s that arise from Galois evaluation are not [necessarily] local units at the
various v ∈ V, it is by no means clear how to relate this Galois evaluation output
data to the codomain of the Θ-link using the horizontally coric portion —
i.e., the [local] unit group portion (aΘ ) and (aq ) — of the Θ-link.

In fact, these two shortcomings are closed related: That is to say, the existence of the
obstruction discussed in §3.4, (i), to the approach to Kummer theory taken in Example
2.12.1, (ii), that arises from the natural action “Ok×μ  Z× ” implies — in light of the
nontrivial extension structure that exists between the value groups and units of ﬁnite
subextensions of “k” in “k” [cf. the discussion in the ﬁnal portion of Example 2.12.1,
(iii)] — that, at least in any sort of a priori or natural sense,
the output data — i.e., theta values and copies of NF’s — of the Galois
evaluation operations discussed in (ii), (iii) above [i.e., which lies in various
copies of “k”!] is by no means multiradial [cf. [IUTchII], Remark 2.9.1,
(iii); [IUTchII], Remark 3.4.1, (ii); [IUTchII], Remark 3.7.1; [IUTchIII], Remark
2.2.1, (iv)].
One of the fundamental ideas of inter-universal Teichmüller theory is that
one may apply the theory of the log-link and log-shells to obtain a solution
to these closely related shortcomings.
More precisely, from the point of view of the log-theta-lattice, the log-link from the lattice
point (n, m − 1) to the lattice point (n, m) [where n, m ∈ Z] allows one to construct [cf.
the notation of Example 2.12.3, (iv)] a holomorphic Frobenius-like log-shell “I”
at (n, m) from the “Ok×μ ” at (n, m − 1). Thus,
the output data — i.e., theta values and copies of NF’s — of the Galois
evaluation operations discussed in (ii), (iii) above at (n, m) acts naturally on
the “I ⊗ Q” [i.e., the copy of “k”] at (n, m) that arises from this log-link from
(n, m − 1) to (n, m) [cf. [IUTchIII], Proposition 3.3, (i); [IUTchIII], Proposition
3.4, (ii); [IUTchIII], Deﬁnition 3.8, (ii)].
On the other hand, this gives rise to a fundamental dilemma:
Since the construction of the log-link — i.e., at a more concrete level, the
formal power series of the natural logarithm — can only be deﬁned if both the
additive and the multiplicative structures of the [topological] rings involved are
available, the log-link and hence, in particular, the construction of log-shells
just discussed, at, say, the lattice point (n, m), are meaningless, at least in
any a priori sense, from the point of view of the lattice point (n + 1, m), i.e.,
the codomain of the Θ-link from (n, m) to (n + 1, m) [cf. [IUTchIII], Remark
3.11.3; Steps (iii) and (iv) of the proof of [IUTchIII], Corollary 3.12].
Another of the fundamental ideas of inter-universal Teichmüller theory is the following
[cf. the discussion in §3.3, (ii), of the symmetry of the [inﬁnite!] vertical lines of the
log-theta-lattice with respect to arbitrary vertical translations!]:

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

By considering structures that are invariant with respect to vertical shifts of
the log-theta-lattice — i.e., vertically coric structures such as holomorphic/
mono-analytic étale-like log-shells that serve as containers for Frobenius-like
objects such as holomorphic Frobenius-like log-shells [cf. Fig. 3.15 below]
or notions of vertical invariance such as upper semi-commutativity or logvolume compatibility [cf. Example 2.12.3, (iv)] — and then transporting
these invariant structures to the opposite side of the Θ-link by means of monoanalytic Frobenius-like log-shells [i.e., which may be constructed directly
from the data “Ok×μ ” that appears in the horizontally coric data (aΘ ), (aq ) of
the Θ-link], one may construct multiradial containers for the output data —
i.e., theta values and copies of NF’s — of the Galois evaluation operations
discussed above.

Here, we observe that each of the four types of log-shells discussed in Example 2.12.3,
(iv), plays an indispensable role in the theory [cf. [IUTchIII], Remark 3.9.5, (vii), (Ob7);
[IUTchIII], Remark 3.12.2, (iv), (v)]:

they belong to a ﬁxed vertical position of a vertical line of the log-theta-lattice,
hence are meaningful even in the absence of the log-link and, in particular, may
be related directly to the Θ-link;

counterparts!] to relate holomorphic Frobenius-like log-shells at diﬀerent vertical positions of a vertical line of the log-theta-lattice to one another in a fashion
[unlike their mono-analytic counterparts!] that takes into account the log-link
[whose construction requires the use of the topological ring structure on these
log-shells!];
· the mono-analytic Frobenius-like log-shells satisfy the property [unlike

the data “Ok×μ ” that appears in the horizontally coric data (aΘ ), (aq ) of the
Θ-link, as well as the property [unlike their étale-like counterparts!] that they
belong to a ﬁxed vertical position of a vertical line of the log-theta-lattice, hence
are meaningful even in the absence of the log-link and, in particular, may be
related directly to the Θ-link [cf. the discussion in the ﬁnal portion of §3.3, (ii)];
· the mono-analytic étale-like log-shells satisfy the property [unlike their
holomorphic counterparts!] that they may be constructed directly from the data
“Gk ” that appears in the horizontally coric data (aΘ ), (aq ) of the Θ-link, as
well as the property [unlike their Frobenius-like counterparts, when taken alone!]
that they may be used, in conjunction with their Frobenius-like counterparts,
to relate mono-analytic Kummer theory [i.e., Kummer isomorphisms between
mono-analytic Frobenius-like/étale-like log-shells] to holomorphic Kummer theory [i.e., Kummer isomorphisms between holomorphic Frobenius-like/étale-like
log-shells].
In particular, the signiﬁcance of working with mono-analytic Frobenius-like log-shells
may be understood as follows. If, instead of working with mono-analytic Frobeniuslike log-shells, one simply passes from holomorphic Frobenius-like log-shells at arbitrary
vertical positions [in a single vertical line of the log-theta-lattice] to holomorphic étalelike log-shells [via Kummer isomorphisms] and then to mono-analytic étale-like log-shells
[by forgetting various structures] — i.e.,

— then the relationship between the mono-analytic étale-like log-shells [whose vertical
position is indeterminate!] and the various holomorphic Frobenius-like log-shells [in
the vertical line under consideration] is subject simultaneously to indeterminacies
arising from both the log-link [i.e., “(Ind3)” — cf. the discussion of §3.7, (i), below]
and the Θ-link [i.e., “(Ind1)” — cf. the discussion of §3.7, (i), below]. Relative to
the analogy discussed in the ﬁnal portion of §3.3, (ii), between the log-theta-lattice and
“C× \GL+ (V )/C× ”, such simultaneous indeterminacies correspond to indeterminacies
 
with respect to the action of the subgroup of GL+ (V ) generated by C× and “ 0t 01 ”. By
contrast, by stipulating that the passage from holomorphic étale-like log-shells to monoanalytic étale-like log-shells be executed in conjunction with the Kummer isomorphisms
[implicit in the data that is glued together in deﬁnition of the Θ-link] with corresponding
Frobenius-like log-shells at the vertical position “0” — i.e.,

[where the vertical arrows denote the respective Kummer isomorphisms] — one obtains
a “decoupling” of the log-link/Θ-link indeterminacies, i.e.,
· a partially rigid relationship between the holomorphic/mono-analytic
étale-like log-shells and the holomorphic/mono-analytic Frobenius-like
log-shells at the vertical position 0 [in the vertical line under consideration]
that is subject only to indeterminacies arising from the Θ-link [i.e., “(Ind1),
(Ind2)” — cf. the discussion of §3.7, (i), below], together with
· a partially rigid relationship between the holomorphic Frobeniuslike log-shells at the vertical position 0 and the various holomorphic
Frobenius-like log-shells at arbitrary vertical positions [in the vertical
line under consideration], i.e., via holomorphic étale-like log-shells, that is
subject only to indeterminacies arising from the log-link [i.e., “(Ind3)” — cf.
the discussion of §3.7, (i), below].
Relative to the analogy discussed in the ﬁnal portion of §3.3, (ii), between the log-thetalattice and “C× \GL+ (V )/C× ”, this “decoupling” of indeterminacies corresponds to an
indeterminacy with respect to an action of C× from the left, together with a distinct
 
action of “ 0t 01 ” from the right.
(v) Processions: In order to achieve the multiradiality discussed in (iv) for
Galois evaluation output data, one further technique must be introduced, namely, the use
of processions [cf. [IUTchI], Deﬁnition 4.10], which serve as a sort of mono-analytic

substitute for the various labels in F
l , |Fl | (= Fl ∪ {0}), or Fl discussed in (i). That is
to say, since these labels are closely related to the various cuspidal inertia subgroups
of the geometric fundamental groups “Δ” of the hyperbolic orbicurves involved [cf. the

Shinichi Mochizuki

102

discussion of (i), (ii); §2.13; §3.3, (v)], it follows that these labels are not horizontally
coric [i.e., not directly visible to the opposite side of the Θ-link — cf. the discussion of
[IUTchIV], Remark 3.6.3, (ii)] and indeed do not even admit, at least in any a priori
sense, any natural multiradial formulation. The approach taken in inter-universal
Teichmüller theory to dealing with this state of aﬀairs [cf. [IUTchI], Proposition 6.9] is
to consider the diagram of inclusions of ﬁnite sets


— where we write S±
j+1 = {0, 1, . . . , j}, for j = 0, . . . , l , and we think of each of these
ﬁnite sets as being subject to arbitrary permutation automorphisms. That is to say, we
think of
def

the set S±
j+1 as a container for the labels 0, 1, . . . , j, and of the label “j” as
“some” element of this container set, i.e., for each j, there is an indeterminacy
of j + 1 possibilities for the element of this container set that corresponds to j.
Here, we note in passing that this sort of indeterminacy is substantially milder than
the indeterminacies that occur if one considers each j only as “some” element of Sl± ,
in which case every j is subject to an indeterminacy of l± possibilities — cf. [IUTchI],
Proposition 6.9, (i), (ii). One then regards
each such container set as an index set for a collection — which is referred
to as a “capsule” [cf. [IUTchI], §0] — of copies of some sort of étale-like
mono-analytic prime-strip.
An étale-like mono-analytic prime-strip is, roughly speaking, a collection of copies of
data “Gk ” indexed by v ∈ V [cf. [IUTchI], Fig. I1.2, and the surrounding discussion; [IUTchI], Deﬁnition 4.1, (iii)]. Now each étale-like mono-analytic prime-strip in a
capsule, as described above, gives rise, at each v ∈ V, to
mono-analytic étale-like log-shells, on which the Galois evaluation output
data acts, in the fashion described in (iv), up to various indeterminacies
that arise from the passage from holomorphic Frobenius-like log-shells to monoanalytic étale-like log-shells [cf. Figs. 3.16, 3.17 below, where each “/± ” denotes
an étale-like mono-analytic prime-strip].
These indeterminacies will be discussed in more detail in §3.7, (i), below. In fact,
ultimately, from the point of various log-volume computations, it is more natural to
consider the Galois evaluation output data as acting, up to various indeterminacies, on
certain tensor products of the various log-shells indexed by a particular container
set S±
j+1 . Such tensor products are referred to as tensor packets [cf. [IUTchIII],
Propositions 3.1, 3.2].

Log-volume estimates via the multiradial representation

In the following, we outline the statements of and relationships between the
main results [cf. [IUTchIII], Theorem 3.11; [IUTchIII], Corollary 3.12; [IUTchIV],
Theorem 1.10; [IUTchIV], Corollaries 2.2, 2.3] of inter-universal Teichmüller theory.
(i) Multiradial representation of the Θ-pilot object up to mild indeterminacies: The content of the discussion of §3.4, §3.5, and §3.6 may be summarized
as follows [cf. [IUTchIII], Theorem A; [IUTchIII], Theorem 3.11]:
the data in the domain (aΘ ), (bΘ ), and (cΘ ) [cf. §3.3, (vii)] of the Θ-link may
be expressed in a fashion that is multiradial, when considered up to certain
indeterminacies (Ind1), (Ind2), (Ind3) [cf. the discussion below], with respect
to the radial algorithm
(aΘ ), (bΘ ), (cΘ ) → (aΘ )
[cf. the discussion at the beginning of §3.4] by regarding this [Frobenius-like!]
data (aΘ ), (bΘ ), and (cΘ ) [up to the indeterminacies (Ind1), (Ind2), (Ind3)] as
data [cf. Fig. 3.18 below] that is constructed by
·

ﬁrst applying the Kummer theory and multiradial decouplings/cyclotomic rigidity of κ-coric rational functions in the
case of (cΘ ) [cf. §3.4, (ii), (v)] and of theta functions/mono-theta
environments in the case of (bΘ ) [cf. §3.4, (iii), (iv), (v); §3.5]; and

· then applying the theory of Galois evaluation, log-shells, and
processions, together with symmetrizing isomorphisms at lΘ
torsion points via the F±
l -symmetry, in the case of (b ) [cf. §3.6,
(i), (ii), (iv), (v)], and at decomposition groups corresponding to
Fmod -/Fsol -rational points via the F

Fig. 3.18: The full multiradial representation
Here, we recall from §3.6, (iv), (v), that the data (bΘ ) and (cΘ ) act on processions of tensor packets that arise from the mono-analytic étale-like log-shells
constructed from the data (aΘ ). The indeterminacies (Ind1),(Ind2), (Ind3) referred to
above act on these log-shells and may be described as follows:
(Ind1) These indeterminacies are the étale-transport indeterminacies [cf. §2.7, (vi);
Example 2.12.3, (i)] that occur as a result of the automorphisms [which, as was
discussed in Example 2.12.3, (i), do not, in general, preserve the ring structure!] of
the various “Gk ’s” that appear in the data (aΘ ).
(Ind2) These indeterminacies are the Kummer-detachment indeterminacies [cf. §2.7,
(vi)] that occur as a result of the identiﬁcation of, or confusion between, monoanalytic Frobenius-like and mono-analytic étale-like log-shells [cf. the discussion of
§3.6, (iv)]. At a more concrete level, these indeterminacies arise from the action of
the group of “isometries” — which is often denoted
“Ism(−)”
[cf. [IUTchII], Example 1.8, (iv)] — of the data “Ok×μ ” [which we regard as equipped
with a system of integral structures, or lattices] of (aΘ ), i.e., the compact topological
group of Gk -equivariant automorphisms of the ind-topological module Ok×μ that, for
⊆ (Ok×μ )H .
each open subgroup H ⊆ Gk , preserve the lattice O×μ
H
k

(Ind3) These indeterminacies are the Kummer-detachment indeterminacies [cf. §2.7,
(vi)] that occur as a result of the upper semi-commutativity [cf. Example 2.12.3,
(iv); §3.6, (iv)] of the log-Kummer correspondence [cf. [IUTchIII], Remark
3.12.2, (iv), (v)], i.e., the system of log-links and Kummer isomorphisms of a
particular vertical line of the log-theta-lattice [cf. Fig. 3.15].
In addition to these “explicitly visible” indeterminacies, there are also “invisible indeterminacies” [cf. [IUTchIII], Remark 3.11.4] that in fact arise, but may be ignored
in the above description, essentially as a formal consequence of the way in which the
various objects that appear are deﬁned:

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

105

×
· The various theta values and copies of Fmod
that occur as Frobenius-like
Galois evaluation output data at various vertical positions of the log-Kummer
correspondence [cf. the discussion of §3.6, (iv), (v)] satisfy an important “noninterference” property [cf. [IUTchIII], Proposition 3.5, (ii), (c); [IUTchIII],
Proposition 3.10, (ii)]: namely, the intersection of such output data with the
product of the local units [i.e., “O× ”] at those elements of V at which the output data in question occurs consists only of roots of unity. As a result, the
only “possible confusion”, or “indeterminacy”, that occurs as a consequence of
possibly applying iterates of the log-link to the various local units consists of a
possible multiplication by a root of unity. On the other hand, since the theta
×
that occur as Frobenius-like Galois evaluation output
values and copies of Fmod
data are deﬁned in such a way as to be stable under the action by multiplication by such roots of unity, this indeterminacy may, in fact, be ignored [cf. the
discussion of [IUTchIII], Remark 3.11.4, (i)].
· The indeterminacy of possible multiplication by ±1 in the cyclotomic
rigidity isomorphism that is applied in the Kummer theory of κ-coric rational functions [cf. the ﬁnal portion of the discussion of §3.4, (ii)] may be ignored
since the global Frobenioids related to the data (cΘ ), i.e., that arise from copies
of Fmod , only require the use of the totality of [copies of] the multiplica×
, which is stabilized by the operation of inversion [cf. the
tive monoid Fmod
discussion of [IUTchIII], Remark 3.11.4, (i)].

At this point, it is useful to recall [cf. the discussion at the beginning of §3.4, (i)]
that it was possible to deﬁne, in §3.3, (vii), the gluing isomorphisms that constitute
the Θ-link between the domain data (aΘ ), (bΘ ), (cΘ ) and the codomain data (aq ),
(bq ), (cq ) precisely because we worked with various abstract monoids or global realiﬁed
Frobenioids, i.e., as opposed to the “conventional scheme-like representations” of this
data (aΘ ), (bΘ ), (cΘ ) in terms of theta values and copies of NF’s. In particular, one
way to interpret the multiradial representation discussed above [cf. the discussion of
“simultaneous execution” at the beginning of §2.9 and §3.4, (i); the discussion of
the properties “IPL”, “SHE”, “APT”, “HIS” in [IUTchIII], Remark 3.11.1] is as follows:
This multiradial representation may be understood as the [somewhat surprising!] assertion that not only the domain data (aΘ ), (bΘ ), (cΘ ), but also the
codomain data (aq ), (bq ), (cq ) — or, indeed,
any collection of data
[i.e., not just the codomain data (aq ), (bq ), (cq )!]
that is isomorphic to the domain data (aΘ ), (bΘ ), (cΘ )
[cf., e.g., the discussion concerning “q λ ” in the second to last display of §3.8
below] — can, when regarded up to suitable indeterminacies, be represented

Fig. 3.19: The gluing, or tautological identiﬁcation “=”, of the Θ-link
from the point of view of the multiradial representation
via the “conventional scheme-like representation” of (aΘ ), (bΘ ), (cΘ )
in a fashion that is compatible with the original “conventional scheme-like
representation” of the given collection of data [i.e., such as the “conventional
scheme-like representation” of the data (aq ), (bq ), (cq )].
If we specialize this interpretation to the case of the data (aq ), (bq ), (cq ), then we obtain
the following [again somewhat surprising!] interpretation of the multiradial representation discussed above [cf. the discussion of §2.4]:
If one takes a symmetrized average over N = 12 , 22 , . . . , j 2 , . . . , (l )2 , and
one works up to suitable indeterminacies, then
the arithmetic line bundle determined by “q”
[i.e., the 2l-th roots of the q-parameter at the valuations ∈ Vbad , or, alternatively, the “q-pilot object”] may be identiﬁed — i.e., from the point of view
of performing any sort of computation that takes into account the “suitable
indeterminacies” — with
the arithmetic line bundle determined by “q N ”
[i.e., the “Θ-pilot object”] obtained by raising the arithmetic line bundle determined by “q” to the N -th tensor power
[cf. Fig. 3.19 above, where “LHS” and “RHS” denote, respectively, the left-hand and
right-hand sides, i.e., the domain and codomain, of the Θ-link].
(ii) Log-volume estimates: The interpretation discussed in the ﬁnal portion of
(i) leads naturally to an estimate of the arithmetic degree of the q-pilot object
[cf. [IUTchIII], Theorem B; [IUTchIII], Corollary 3.12], as follows [cf. Steps (x), (xi) of
the proof of [IUTchIII], Corollary 3.12; [IUTchIII], Fig. 3.8]:

) One starts with the Frobenius-like version of the q-pilot object — i.e., “q

— on the RHS of the Θ-link. All subsequent computations are to be understood as
computations that are performed relative to the ﬁxed arithmetic holomorphic
structure of this RHS of the Θ-link.

) One then applies the multiradial representation discussed in (i) [cf. Fig. 3.19].

occur in this multiradial representation is invariant with respect to the indeterminacies (Ind1) and (Ind2), as well as with respect to the invisible indeterminacies,
discussed in (i).

i.e., “commutativity” at the level of inclusions of regions in log-shells [cf. the discussion of Example 2.12.3, (iv)] — may be understood as asserting that the log-volume
of the multiradial representation of the Θ-pilot object must be interpreted as an
upper bound.

completions of the ring of integers of K at, for simplicity, the valuations ∈ Vnon ],
i.e., relative to the arithmetic holomorphic structure of the RHS of the Θ-link!
) Such “Ok -modules” are obtained by, essentially [cf. [IUTchIII], Remark 3.9.5, for
more details], forming the “Ok -modules generated by” the various tensor packets
of log-shells [cf. the discussion of §3.6, (iv), (v)] that appear in the multiradial

“p”] just topological modules
“log(Ok× ) ⊗ log(Ok× ) ⊗ . . . ⊗ log(Ok× )”
— that is to say, tensor products of j + 1 copies of “log(Ok× )” at the portion of
the multiradial representation labeled by j. This operation yields a slightly enlargement of the multiradial representation, which is referred to as the holomorphic
hull [cf. [IUTchIII], Corollary 3.12; [IUTchIII], Remark 3.9.5] of the multiradial
representation.

— where the log-volume of the q-pilot object on the right-hand side of the inequality
is negative and of negligible absolute value by comparison to the terms of interest
[to be discussed in more detail in (iv) below] on the left-hand side of the inequality.
(iii) Comparison with a result of Stewart-Yu: Recall that in [StYu], an inequality is obtained which may be thought of as a sort of “weak version of the ABC
Conjecture”, i.e., which is, roughly speaking, weaker than the inequality of the usual
ABC Conjecture in that it contains an undesired exponential operation “exp(−)” in
its upper bound. This sort of deviation from the inequality of the usual ABC Conjecture is of interest from the point of view of the “vertical shift” discussed in §3.6, (iv),
which, on the one hand, gives rise to the indeterminacy (Ind3) [cf. the discussion
est
of (i); (ii), (5 )] and, on the other hand, arises from the fact that the horizontally
coric portion of the data related by the Θ-link diﬀers from the sort of data in which
one is ultimately interested precisely by a single iterate of the log-link, i.e., a single
vertical shift in the log-theta-lattice.
(iv) Computation of log-volumes: Let us return to the discussion of (ii). It
est
remains to compute the left-hand side of the inequality of (ii), (12 ), in more elementary terms. This is done in [IUTchIV], Theorem 1.10. This computation yields a rather
strong version of the Szpiro Conjecture inequality, in the case of elliptic curves
over NF’s that admit initial Θ-data [cf. §3.3, (i)] that satisﬁes certain technical conditions. The existence of such initial Θ-data that satisﬁes certain technical conditions is
then veriﬁed in [IUTchIV], Corollary 2.2, (ii), for elliptic curves over NF’s that satisfy
certain technical conditions by applying the techniques of [GenEll], §3, §4. Here, we
remark in passing that the prime number l that appears in this initial Θ-data constructed in [IUTchIV], Corollary 2.2, (ii), is roughly of the order of the square root of
the height of the elliptic curve under consideration [cf. [IUTchIV], Corollary 2.2, (ii),
(C1)]. This initial Θ-data yields a version of the Szpiro Conjecture inequality [cf.
[IUTchIV], Corollary 2.2, (ii), (iii)], which, although somewhat weaker and less eﬀective
than the inequality of [IUTchIV], Theorem 1.10, is still rather strong in the sense that
it implies that, if we restrict, for simplicity, to the case of elliptic curves over Q, then
the “ terms” that appear in the Szpiro Conjecture inequality concerning the
height h may be bounded above by terms of the order of
h1/2 · log(h)
— i.e., at least in the case of elliptic curves over Q whose moduli are “compactly bounded”, in the sense that the moduli lie inside given ﬁxed compact
subsets of the sets of rational points of the moduli of elliptic curves over R and
Q2

[cf. [IUTchIV], Remark 1.10.5, (ii), (iii); [IUTchIV], Remark 2.2.1, (i), (ii)]. Here, we
recall from these Remarks in [IUTchIV] [cf. also [Mss]; [vFr], §2] that
This “ 12 ” in the exponent of h is of interest in light of the existence of sequences
of “abc sums” for which this “ 12 ” is asympototically attained, i.e., as a
bound from below, but only if one works with abc sums that correspond to
elliptic curves whose moduli are not necessarily compactly bounded.
This prompts the following question:
Can one construct sequences of abc sums with similar asymptotic behavior,
but which correspond to elliptic curves whose moduli are indeed compactly
bounded?
At the time of writing, it appears that no deﬁnitive answer to this question is known,
although there does exist some preliminary work in this direction [cf. [Wada]]. In this
context, it is also of interest to recall [cf. the discussion of [IUTchIV], Remark 2.2.1;
[vFr], §2] that this “ 12 ” is highly reminiscent of the “ 12 ” that appears in the Riemann
hypothesis. So far, in the above discussion, we have restricted ourselves to versions
of the Szpiro Conjecture inequality for elliptic curves over NF’s that satisfy various
technical conditions. On the other hand,
by applying the theory of noncritical Belyi maps [cf. the discussion in the ﬁnal portion of §2.1; [GenEll], Theorem 2.1; [IUTchIV], Corollary 2.3; [IUTchIV],
Theorem A] — which may be thought of as a sort of arithmetic version of
analytic continuation [cf. the discussion of §3.3, (vi); [IUTchI], Remark
5.1.4; [IUTchIV], Remark 2.2.4, (iii)] — one may derive the inequalities of the
Vojta/Szpiro/ABC Conjectures in their usual form.
We refer to [Fsk], §1.3, §2.12, for another — and, in certain respects, more detailed —
discussion of these aspects of inter-universal Teichmüller theory. Although a detailed
discussion of the somewhat technical, but entirely elementary computation of the leftest
hand side of the inequality of (ii), (12 ), lies beyond the scope of the present paper,
we conclude the present (iv) with a summary of the very simple computation of the
est
leading term of the left-hand side of the inequality of (ii), (12 ):
· First, one notes [cf. [IUTchIV], Proposition 1.2, (i); [IUTchIV], Proposition
1.3, (i); the second to last display of Step (v) of the proof of [IUTchIV], Theorem
1.10] that, if one ignores [since we are only interested in computing the leading
term!] the archimedean valuations of K, as well as the nonarchimedean valuations of K whose ramiﬁcation index over Q is “large” [i.e., is ≥ the cardinality
of the set of nonzero elements of the residue ﬁeld of the corresponding prime of

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

111

Q], then the resulting log-volume [suitably normalized!] of the tensor packet
of log-shells corresponding to the label j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , l } is
(j + 1) · log(dK )
— where we write log(dK ) for the arithmetic degree [suitably normalized, so as
to be invariant with respect to ﬁnite extensions — cf. [IUTchIV], Deﬁnition 1.9,
(i)] of the arithmetic divisor determined by the diﬀerent ideal of the number
ﬁeld K over Q.
· On the other hand, the eﬀect — i.e., on the tensor packet of log-shells corre2
sponding to the label j — of multiplying by the theta value “q j ” [cf. Figs.
3.16, 3.18] at v ∈ Vbad [cf. the second to last display of Step (v) of the proof of
[IUTchIV], Theorem 1.10] is given by
2

− j2l · log(q)
— where we write log(q) for the arithmetic degree [again suitably normalized]
of the arithmetic divisor determined by the q-parameters of the elliptic curve
E over F at the valuations that lie over valuations ∈ Vbad
mod .
· Thus, the leading term of the log-volume of the left-hand side of the
est
inequality of (ii), (12 ), is given by

6 · log(dK ) − log(q)
— that one wishes to bound from below in order to conclude [a suitable
version of] the Szpiro Conjecture inequality.
As discussed in [IUTchIV], Remark 1.10.1 [cf. also the discussion of §3.9, (i), (ii), below],
this “computation of the leading term”, which was originally motivated by the schemetheoretic Hodge-Arakelov theory of [HASurI], [HASurII], was in fact known to
the author around the year 2000. Put another way, one of the primary motivations
for the development of inter-universal Teichmüller theory was precisely the problem of
establishing a suitable framework, or geometry, in which this computation could
be performed.

§ 3.8.

Comparison with the Gaussian integral

At this point, it is of interest to compare and contrast the theory of “arithmetic
changes of coordinates” [i.e., §2] and multiradial representations [i.e., the present
§3] discussed so far in the present paper with the classical computation of the Gaussian
integral, as discussed in §1. In the following, the various “Steps” refer to the “Steps”
in the computation of the Gaussian integral, as reviewed in §1.
(1

formally reminiscent [cf. [IUTchII], Remark 1.12.5, (ii)] of the assignment

) The introduction of two “mutually alien” copies of the Gaussian integral in
Step 3 may be thought of as corresponding to the appearance of the two Θ±ell N F Hodge theaters “•” in the domain and codomain of the Θ-link [cf. §2.7, (i); the
two vertical lines in the right-hand portion of Fig. 3.6], which may be thought of as
representing two “mutually alien” copies of the conventional scheme theory surrounding the elliptic curve under consideration, i.e., the elliptic curve that appears
in the initial Θ-data of §3.3, (i).

) The two dimensions of the Euclidean space R2 that appears in Step 4 may
be thought of as corresponding to the two dimensions of the log-theta-lattice
[cf. §3.3, (ii)], which are closely related to the two underlying combinatorial
dimensions of a ring. Here, we recall from §2.11 that these two underlying combinatorial dimensions of a ring may be understood quite explicitly in the case of
NF’s, MLF’s, or the ﬁeld of complex numbers.
) The point of view discussed in Step 5 that integrals may be thought of as computations of net masses as limits of sums of inﬁnitesimals of zero mass may be
understood as consisting of two aspects: First of all, the summation of local contributions that occurs in an integral may be regarded as corresponding to the use of
prime-strips [i.e., local data indexed by elements of V — cf. the discussion of §3.3,
(iv)] and the computation of heights in terms of log-volumes, as discussed in §2.2.
On the other hand, the limit aspect of an integral, which involves the consideration
of some sort of notion of inﬁnitesimals [i.e., “zero mass” objects], may be thought
of as corresponding to the fundamental dichotomy between Frobenius-like and
étale-like objects [cf. §2.2; §2.7, (ii), (iii); §2.8; §2.9; §3.3, (iii); §3.4, (i); §3.5].
) The generalities concerning the eﬀect on integrals of changes of coordinates
on local patches of the Euclidean plane in Step 6 may be thought of as corresponding

to the generalities on the computational technique of mono-anabelian transport
as a mechanism for computing the eﬀect of “arithmetic changes of coordinates”
[cf. the discussion of §2.7, §2.8, §2.9, §2.10, §2.11]. This technique is motivated
by the concrete examples given in §2.5, §2.6 of changes of coordinates related to
positive characteristic Frobenius morphisms, as well as by the discussion of
examples of ﬁnite discrete approximations of harmonic analysis given in §2.14.

) The fundamental examples given in Step 7 of linear changes of coordinates
in the Euclidean plane — i.e., unipotent linear transformations, toral dilations,
and rotations — may be thought of as corresponding to the fundamental examples
of arithmetic changes of coordinates in the case of MLF’s that were discussed
in §2.12 [cf. also the discussion of §2.3, §2.4, and §2.13; §3.3, (vi)].

) The passage from planar cartesian to polar coordinates discussed in Step
8 may be understood as a sort of rotation, or continuous deformation, between
the two mutually alien copies of the Gaussian integral introduced in Step 3, i.e.,
which correspond to the x- and y-axes. Thus, this passage to polar coordinates may
be regarded as corresponding [cf. the discussion at the beginning of §3.1; §3.1, (iv);
§3.2; the discussion surrounding Figs. 3.1, 3.3, 3.5, 3.6, 3.12, 3.13, 3.19; the discussion of [IUTchII], Remark 1.12.5] to the “deformation”, or “parallel transport”,
between distinct collections of radial data that appears in the deﬁnition of the
notion of multiradiality and, in particular, to the passage from the log-thetalattice to the étale-picture [cf. §3.6, (i)] and, ultimately, to the multiradial
representation of §3.7, (i).
) The fundamental decoupling into radial and angular coordinates discussed in
Step 9 may be understood as corresponding to the discussion in §3.4 of Kummer
theory for special types of functions via multiradial decouplings/cyclotomic
rigidity [cf. also the discussion of unit group and value group portions in §2.11;
§3.3, (vii)].
) The eﬃcacy of the change of coordinates that renders possible the evaluation
of the radial integral in Step 10 may be understood as an essentially formal consequence of the quadratic nature of the exponent that appears in the Gaussian
distribution. This fundamental aspect of the computation of the Gaussian integral
may be regarded as corresponding to the fact that the rigidity properties of monotheta environments that underlie the multiradial decouplings/cyclotomic
rigidity discussed in §3.4, (iii), (iv) are, in essence, formal consequences [cf. the
discussion in the ﬁnal portion of §3.4, (iv)] of the quadratic structure of the commutators of the theta groups associated to the ample line bundles that appear
in the theory [cf. the discussion of [IUTchIII], Remark 2.1.1; [IUTchIV], Remark

In particular, the evaluation of the radial integral in Step 10 corresponds to the portion of inter-universal Teichmüller theory that relates to the [local] value group
gau
portion (bΘ ) of the Θ-link [cf. (1 )].
(10

) The angular integral of Step 11 is an integral over the unit group of the
ﬁeld of complex numbers that is evaluated by executing the change of coordinates
determined by the imaginary part of the natural logarithm. This important aspect
of the computation of the Gaussian integral may be regarded as corresponding to
the theory of Galois evaluation and log-shells exposed in §3.6 — cf., especially,
the theory involving iterates of the log-link discussed in §3.6, (iv); §3.7, (i). In
this context, it is of interest to recall [cf. Example 2.12.3, (v); §3.3, (ii), (vi)] that
the log-link may be understood as a sort of arithmetic rotation, or juggling,
of the two underlying combinatorial dimensions of a ring that essentially concerns
the [local] unit group portion, i.e., (aΘ ), (aq ), of the Θ-link [cf. §3.3, (vii); §3.6,
(iv)].
) The ﬁnal computation of the Gaussian integral in Step 12 may be summarized
gau
[cf. §1.7] as asserting that the naive change of coordinates of (1 ) may in fact
be “justiﬁed”, provided that one allows for a suitable “error factor” given by the
gau
square root of the angular integral of (10 ). This conclusion may be understood
as corresponding to the computation, discussed in §3.7, (ii), (iii), (iv), of the
est
left-hand side of the inequality of §3.7, (ii), (12 ). This computation may be
summarized as asserting that one obtains a bound on the height of the elliptic
curve under consideration whose leading term is the “log-diﬀerent log(dK )” [cf.
the ﬁnal portion of §3.7, (iv)] that one expects from [a suitable version of] the
Szpiro Conjecture. Put another way, this computation may be summarized as
asserting that
the naive approach outlined in §2.3, §2.4 to bounding heights via
“Gaussian Frobenius morphisms” on NF’s may in fact be “justiﬁed”,
provided that one allows for a suitable “error factor” that arises from
the indeterminacies (Ind1), (Ind2), (Ind3) acting on the log-shells
— i.e., the [local] unit group portion (aΘ ), (aq ) of the Θ-link [cf. the
gau
discussion of (10 )] — that appear in the multiradial representation
discussed in §3.7, (i) [cf. also the discussion of [IUTchIV], Remark 2.2.2].
Finally, in this context, we observe [cf. the ﬁnal portion of Step 12] that, just as in
the case of the computation of the Gaussian integral, it is essentially a hopeless task
2
∞
to identify “explicit portions” of the original Gaussian integral −∞ e−x dx
on the real line that “correspond” precisely, in some sort of meaningful sense, to

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

117

the radial and angular integrals of Steps 10 and 11, it is essentially a hopeless task
to
trace, in some sort of explicit or readily computable fashion, the way
in which the value group portions (bΘ ), (cΘ ) in the domain of the
gau
Θ-link [cf. (9 )] appear within the multiradial representation via tensor
gau
packets of log-shells [cf. (10 )] expressed in objects arising from the
codomain of the Θ-link
[cf. the discussion of “APT” in [IUTchIII], Remark 3.11.1, (iv)].
The various observations discussed in the present §3.8 are summarized in Figs. 3.20.1,
gau
3.20.2, above. Finally, with regard to (1 ), we note that

the left-hand side “{q j }j=1,...,l ” of the assignment discussed in (1

“q λ ” for 1 = λ ∈ Q>0
or by
“{q N ·j }j=1,...,l ” for 2 ≤ N ∈ N.

Indeed, this property of the left-hand side of the assignment discussed in (1
case of “q λ ”, a consequence of the

gau

) is, in the

· the lack [i.e., in the case of “q λ ”] of a theory of multiradial decouplings/cyclotomic rigidity of the sort [cf. the discussion of §3.4, (iii), (iv)] that exists
in the case of theta functions and mono-theta environments
[cf. the discussion of [IUTchIII], Remark 2.2.2, (i), (ii), (iii)] and, in the case of
2
“{q N ·j }j=1,...,l ”, a consequence of the
· special role [cf. the discussion of §3.4, (iii)] played by the ﬁrst power of
[reciprocals of l-th roots of the] theta function;
· the condition [cf. the discussion at the beginning of §3.6] that the assignment
“abstract functions → values” that occurs in the passage from theta functions
to theta values be obtained by applying the technique of Galois evaluation
[cf. [IUTchII], Remark 3.6.4, (iii), (iv); [IUTchIII], Remark 2.1.1, (iv); the discussion
of the ﬁnal portion of Step (xi) of the proof of [IUTchIII], Corollary 3.12]. Moreover,
gau
the negation of this property of the left-hand side of the assignment discussed in (1 )
would imply a stronger version of the Szpiro Conjecture inequality that is in fact false
[cf. [IUTchIV], Remark 2.3.2, (ii)]. By contrast,

the right-hand side “q” of the assignment discussed in (1

) can be replaced

by “q ” for 1 = λ ∈ Q>0 , without any substantive eﬀect on the theory; moreover,
doing so does not result in any substantive improvement in the estimates
discussed in §3.7, (ii), (iii), (iv)
λ

[cf. [IUTchIII], Remark 3.12.1, (ii)]. In this context, it is of interest to observe that:
This sort of qualitative diﬀerence between the left- and right- hand sides of the
2
assignment {q j }j=1,...,l → q is reminiscent of the qualitative diﬀerence
— e.g., the presence or absence of the exponential! — between the left- and

right- hand sides of the naive change of coordinates e−x  u.

Relation to scheme-theoretic Hodge-Arakelov theory

In the present §3.9, we pause to reconsider the theory of multiradial representations developed in the present §3 from the point of view of the scheme-theoretic
Hodge-Arakelov theory discussed in Example 2.14.3 — a theory which, as discussed
in the ﬁnal portion of §3.7, (iv), played a central role in motivating the development of
inter-universal Teichmüller theory.

that constitutes the fundamental theorem of Hodge-Arakelov theory discussed
in Example 2.14.3 in a bit more detail [cf., e.g., the discussion surrounding [Pano],
Theorem 1.1] in the case where F is an NF. First of all, we observe that, although both
the domain and codomain of this isomorphism are F -vector spaces of dimension l2 , by
considering the natural action of suitable theta groups on the domain and codomain
and applying the well-known theory of irreducible representations of theta groups, one
may conclude that, up to “uninteresting redudancies”, this isomorphism may in fact
be [“essentially”] regarded as an isomorphism between F -vector spaces of dimension l.
The left-hand side of this isomorphism of l-dimensional F -vector spaces admits a natural
Hodge ﬁltration that arises by considering the subspaces of relative degree < t, for
t = 0, . . . , l − 1. Moreover, one veriﬁes easily that, if we write ωE for the cotangent space
of E at the origin of E, and τE for the dual of ωE , then the adjacent subquotients of
this Hodge ﬁltration are the 1-dimensional F -vector spaces
τE⊗t
for t = 0, . . . , l − 1, tensored with some ﬁxed 1-dimensional F -vector space [i.e., which is
independent of t], which we shall ignore since its arithmetic degree [i.e., when regarded

as being equipped with natural integral structures at the nonarchimedean valuations of
F and natural Hermitian structures at the archimedean valuations of F ] is suﬃciently
small that its omission does not aﬀect the computation of the leading terms of interest.
On the other hand, the right-hand side of the isomorphism under consideration admits
a natural theta trivialization [i.e., a natural isomorphism with the F -vector space
F ⊕l given by the direct sum of l copies of the F -vector space F , which we think of as
being labeled by t = 0, . . . , l − 1], which is compatible — up to contributions that are
suﬃciently small as to have no eﬀect on the computation of the leading terms of interest
— with the various natural integral structures and natural Hermitian metrics involved,
except at the valuations where E has potentially multiplicative reduction, where one
must adjust the natural integral structure [i.e., the integral structure determined by the
ring of integers OF of F ] on the copy of F in F ⊕l labeled t ∈ {0, . . . , l − 1} by a factor
of
2
q t /4
— where the notation “q” denotes a 2l-th root of the q-parameter of E at the valuation
under consideration. Next, let us observe that [again up to contributions that are
suﬃciently small as to have no eﬀect on the computation of the leading terms of interest]
one may replace the label t ∈ {0, . . . , l − 1} by a label j ∈ {1, . . . , l }, where we think
def ⊗2
of t as ≈ 2j. Write Ωlog
E = ωE . Then the 1-dimensional F -vector spaces — i.e., which
we think of as arithmetic line bundles by equipping these 1-dimensional F -vector spaces
with natural integral structures and natural Hermitian metrics — corresponding to the
label j ∈ {1, . . . , l } on the left- and right-hand sides of the natural isomorphism of ldimensional F -vector spaces determined by the fundamental theorem of Hodge-Arakelov
theory assume the form

— where the notation “∨” denotes the dual. Put another way, if we tensor the dual of
the left-hand side contribution at j ∈ {1, . . . , l } with the right-hand side contribution
at j ∈ {1, . . . , l }, then we obtain the conclusion that the natural isomorphism under
consideration may be thought of “at a very rough level” — i.e., by replacing the Hodge
ﬁltration with its semi-simpliﬁcation, etc. — as a sort of
global section of some sort of weighted average over j of the [arithmetic
line bundles corresponding to the] 1-dimensional F -vector spaces

of the q-parameter; by abuse of notation, we use the same notation for “compactiﬁed
moduli stack versions” of the corresponding objects introduced in the discussion of
elliptic curves over NF’s. That is to say, in summary,
the determinant of the natural isomorphism that appears in the fundamental theorem of Hodge-Arakelov theory is simply [an invertible constant multiple of] some positive tensor power of the well-known discriminant

(ii) Comparison with inter-universal Teichmüller theory: First, we begin
with the observation that, relative to the classical analogy between NF’s and onedimensional functions ﬁelds [over some ﬁeld of constants], it is natural to think of
· log-shells as localized absolute arithmetic analogues of the notion of the sheaf
of logarithmic diﬀerentials.
Indeed, this point of view is supported by the fact that the log-shell associated to a
ﬁnite extension of Qp [for some prime number p] whose absolute ramiﬁcation index is
≤ p − 2 coincides with the dual fractional ideal to the diﬀerent ideal of the given ﬁnite
extension of Qp [cf. [IUTchIV], Proposition 1.2, (i); [IUTchIV], Proposition 1.3, (i)].
Thus, it is natural to regard

— where j ranges over the elements of {1, . . . , l } — of the discussion of (i) as
a sort of scheme-theoretic analogue, or precursor, of the portion labeled
by j of the multiradial representation discussed in §3.7, (i) [cf. also the
est
explicit display of §3.7, (ii), (8 )];
· the resulting computation of global degrees “deg(−)” given in (i) as a sort of
scheme-theoretic analogue, or precursor, of the computation of the leading
est
term of the log-volume of the left-hand side of the inequality of §3.7, (ii), (12 )
[cf. the ﬁnal portion of §3.7, (iv)].
Indeed, this was precisely the point of view of the author around the year 2000 that
motivated the author to develop inter-universal Teichmüller theory.
(iii) Analytic torsion interpretation: In conventional Arakelov theory for varieties over NF’s, analytic torsion refers to a metric invariant, at the archimedean
valuations of an NF, that measures the way in which the space of global [holomorphic/algebraic] sections of a line bundle — which is regarded, by means of various
considerations in harmonic analysis, as a subspace of the Hilbert space of L2 -class sections of the line bundle — is embedded inside this ambient Hilbert space of L2 -class
sections.
Since this ambient Hilbert space of L2 -class sections may be regarded as a topological invariant, i.e., which is unaﬀected by deformations of the holomorphic
moduli of the variety under consideration, the notion of analytic torsion may
be understood as a measure of the way in which the subspace constituted by
the space of global algebraic sections — which depends, in a quite essential
fashion, on the holomorphic moduli of the variety under consideration — is
embedded inside this topological invariant.
When formulated in this way,
the notion of analytic torsion becomes highly reminiscent of the computational technique of mono-analytic transport [cf. the discussion of §2.7; §2.9;
§3.1, (v)] and, in particular, of the use of log-shells to construct the “multiradial containers” [cf. the discussion of §3.6, (iv)] for the various arithmetic
holomorphic structures that appear in the multiradial representation
discussed in §3.7, (i).
Indeed, from this point of view, scheme-theoretic Hodge-Arakelov theory may be understood as a sort of intermediate step — i.e., a ﬁnite discrete approximation, in the
spirit of the discussion of §2.14, which is, moreover, [unlike the classical notion of analytic torsion!] deﬁned over NF’s — between the classical notion of analytic torsion
and inter-universal Teichmüller theory. Put another way,

Shinichi Mochizuki

122

· the natural isomorphism that appears in the fundamental theorem of schemetheoretic Hodge-Arakelov theory may be understood as a sort of polynomial-theoretic discretization of the theory surrounding the classical notion
of analytic torsion, while
· inter-universal Teichmüller theory may be understood as a sort of global
Galois-theoretic version over NF’s of the theory surrounding the classical
notion of analytic torsion
[cf. the discussion of [IUTchIV], Remark 1.10.4].
§ 3.10.

The technique of tripodal transport

In the present §3.10, we re-examine inter-universal Teichmüller theory once
again, this time from the point of view of the technique of tripodal transport. Various
versions of this technique may also be seen in previous work of the author concerning
· p-adic Teichmüller theory,
· scheme-theoretic Hodge-Arakelov theory, and
· combinatorial anabelian geometry.
The proof given by
· Bogomolov [cf. [ABKP], [Zh], [BogIUT], as well as the discussion of §4.3,
(iii), below] of the geometric version of the Szpiro Conjecture over the complex
numbers
may also be re-interpreted from the point of view of this technique.
(i) The notion of tripodal transport: The general notion of tripodal transport may be summarized as follows [cf. also Fig. 3.21 below]:
(1

) One starts with a “nontrivial property” of interest [i.e., that one wishes to
verify!] associated to some sort of given arithmetic holomorphic structure —
such as a hyperbolic curve or a number ﬁeld [cf. the discussion of §2.7, (vii)].

) One observes that this nontrivial property of interest [i.e., associated to the
given arithmetic holomorphic structure] may be derived by combining a “relatively
trivial” property, again associated to the given arithmetic holomorphic structure,
with some sort of alternative property of interest.
) One establishes some sort of parallel transport mechanism — which is typically not compatible with the given arithmetic [i.e., scheme-/ring-theoretic!] holomorphic structure — that allows one to reduce the issue of verifying the alternative

property of interest for the given arithmetic holomorphic structure to a “corresponding version” in the case of the tripod [i.e., the projective line minus three
points] of this alternative property of interest.

) By combining (1 ), (2 ), (3 ), (4 ), one concludes that the original nontrivial property of interest associated to the given arithmetic holomorphic
structure does indeed hold, as desired.

Here, we note that the steps (3 ), (4 ) are often very closely related, and, indeed, at
times, it is diﬃcult to isolate these two steps from one another. This sort of argument
might strike some readers at ﬁrst glance as “mysterious” or “astonishing” in the sense
that ultimately, one is able to

conclude the original nontrivial property of interest [cf. (1 )] associated
trp
to the given arithmetic holomorphic structure [cf. (5 )] despite that
fact that the nontrivial content of the argument centers around the arithtrp

metic surrounding the tripod [cf. (3 ), (4 )], in sharp contrast to the fact
that the argument only requires the use of a “relatively trivial” observation
trp
concerning the given arithmetic holomorphic structure [cf. (2 )].

Perhaps it is most natural to regard this sense of “mysteriousness” or “astonishment”
trp
as a reﬂection of the potency of the parallel transport mechanism [cf. (3 )] that
is employed. This “potency” is, in many of the examples discussed below, derived as
a consequence of various rigidity properties, such as anabelian properties. Such
rigidity properties may only be derived by

124

Shinichi Mochizuki

applying the mechanism of parallel transport via rigidity properties —
not to relatively simple “types of mathematical objects” such as vector spaces
or modules, as is typically the case in classical instances of parallel transport!
— but rather to complicated mathematical objects [cf. the discussion of
[IUTchIV], Remark 3.3.2], such as the sort of Galois groups/étale fundamental
groups that occur in anabelian geometry, i.e., mathematical objects whose
intrinsic structure is suﬃciently rich to allow one to establish rigidity properties that are suﬃciently “potent” to compensate for the “loss of structure”
that arises from sacriﬁcing compatibility with classical scheme-/ring-theoretic
structures.
Here, we note that it is necessary to sacriﬁce compatibility with classical scheme-/ringtheoretic structures precisely because such structures typically constitute a fundamental obstruction to relating the arithmetic surrounding the given arithmetic holomorphic structure to the arithmetic surrounding the tripod. A typical example of this sort
of “fundamental obstruction” may be seen by considering, for instance, the case of two
[scheme-theoretically!] non-isomorphic proper hyperbolic curves over an algebraically
closed ﬁeld of characteristic zero, which, nonetheless, have isomorphic étale fundamental groups. This point of view, i.e., of overcoming the sort of “fundamental obstruction”
to parallel transport that arises from imposing the restriction of working within a ﬁxed
scheme/ring theory, is closely related to the introduction of the notions of Frobeniuslike and étale-like structures — cf. the discussion of §2.7, (ii), (iii); §2.8.
(ii) Inter-universal Teichmüller theory via tripodal transport: We begin
our discussion by observing that, when viewed from the point of view of the notion
of tripodal transport, inter-universal Teichmüller theory may be recapitulated as
follows:
est

trp

The fundamental log volume estimate (12 ) [cf. (1 )] is obtained in the
trp
est
est
argument discussed in §3.7, (ii) [cf. (5 )], by combining [cf. (9 ), (10 ),
est
trp
(11 )] a relatively simple argument [cf. (2 )] carried out in the arithmetic
est

holomorphic structure of the RHS of the Θ-link [cf. (1 ), (7 )], involving
relatively simple operations such as the formation of the holomorphic hull [cf.
est
est

trp
(6 ), (7 ), (8 )], with the parallel transport mechanism [cf. (3 ), as
well as the discussion of §3.1, (iv), (v)] furnished by the multiradial repreest
est
est
est
sentation [cf. (2 ), (3 ), (4 ), (5 )], which is established by considering
various properties of objects [cf. §3.4, §3.6], such as the theta function on the
trp
Tate curve [cf. §3.4, (iii), (iv); Fig. 3.9], on the LHS of the Θ-link [cf. (4 )].
Here, we recall from the discussion of §3.4, (iii), (iv); Fig. 3.9, that
the theory surrounding the theta function on the Tate curve may be thought

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

125

of as a sort of function-theoretic representation of the p-adic arithmetic
geometry of a copy of the tripod for which the cusps “0” and “∞” are subject
to the involution symmetry that permutes these two cusps and leaves the cusp
“1” ﬁxed.
Also, we recall from the discussion of §3.7, (i) [cf. also the discussion of the properties
“IPL”, “SHE”, “APT”, “HIS” in [IUTchIII], Remark 3.11.1] that the parallel transport
mechanism furnished by the multiradial representation revolves around the following
central property:
the algorithm that yields the multiradial representation converts any collection
of input data [i.e., not just the codomain data (aq ), (bq ), (cq ) of the Θ-link!]
that is isomorphic to the domain data (aΘ ), (bΘ ), (cΘ ) of the Θ-link — i.e., in
somewhat more technical terminology [cf. [IUTchII], Deﬁnition 4.9, (viii)], any
F ×μ -prime-strip — into output data that is expressed in terms of the
arithmetic holomorphic structure of the input data, i.e., of the codomain
of the Θ-link.
Finally, at a more technical level, we recall from §3.3, (vi); §3.4, (ii); §3.4, (iii), (iv),
that this parallel transport mechanism is established by applying
· the theory of the étale theta function developed in [EtTh];
· the theory of [local and global] mono-anabelian reconstruction developed
in [AbsTopII], [AbsTopIII].
Here, it is of interest to observe that both the theory of elliptic cuspidalization,
which plays an important role in [EtTh], and the theory of Belyi cuspidalization,
which plays an important role in [AbsTopII], [AbsTopIII], may be regarded as essentially formal consequences of the fundamental anabelian results obtained in [pGC].
The rigidity properties developed in [EtTh] also depend, in a fundamental way, on the
interpretation [i.e., as rigidity properties of the desired type!] given in [EtTh] of the
theta symmetries of the theta function on the Tate curve.
(iii) p-adic Teichmüller theory via tripodal transport: When viewed from
the point of view of the notion of tripodal transport, a substantial portion of the p-adic
Teichmüller theory of [pOrd], [pTch], [pTchIn] may be summarized as follows:
One constructs a theory of canonical indigenous bundles, canonical Frobenius liftings, and associated canonical Galois representations into P GL2 (−)
[for a suitable “(−)” — cf. [pTchIn], Theorems 1.2, 1.4, for more details] for
trp
trp
trp
quite general p-adic hyperbolic curves [cf. (1 ), (2 ), (5 )] by establishing
trp
a parallel transport mechanism [cf. (3 )] that allows one to transport

126

Shinichi Mochizuki

similar canonical objects associated to the tautological family of elliptic curves
trp
over the tripod [cf. (4 )].
Here, we recall that, prior to [pOrd], the existence of such canonical objects associated
to a p-adic hyperbolic curve was only known in the case of Shimura curves, i.e., such
as the tripod. From the point of view of the notion of tripodal transport, it is also of
interest to observe that:
The notion of an ordinary Frobenius lifting [cf. [pTchIn], Theorem 1.3],
which plays a central role in [pOrd], [pTch], [pTchIn], may be understood as a
sort of p-adic generalization of the most fundamental example of a Frobenius
lifting, namely, the endomorphism
T

→

Tp

[where T denotes the standard coordinate on the projective line] of the tripod
over a p-adic ﬁeld. This endomorphism is equivariant with respect to the symmetry of the tripod which permutes the cusps “0” and “∞” and leaves the cusp
“1” ﬁxed.
At a more technical level, we recall that the parallel transport mechanism employed in
p-adic Teichmüller theory revolves around the following two fundamental technical tools:
· the fact that the natural morphism from the moduli stack of nilcurves [i.e.,
pointed stable curves equipped with an indigenous bundle whose p-curvature
is square nilpotent] to the corresponding moduli stack of pointed stable curves
is a ﬁnite, ﬂat, and local complete intersection morphism of degree p to
the power of the dimension of these moduli stacks [cf. [pTchIn], Theorem 1.1];
· various strong rigidity properties, with respect to deformation, that
hold precisely over the ordinary locus of the moduli stack of nilcurves, i.e.,
the étale locus of the natural morphism from the moduli stack of nilcurves to
the corresponding moduli stack of pointed stable curves.
In this context, it is of interest to observe, considering the fundamental role played by
such notions as diﬀerentials and curvature in the classical diﬀerential-geometric version of parallel transport, that both of these fundamental technical tools rely on various
subtle properties of the p-curvature and Frobenius actions on diﬀerentials. This
relationship with diﬀerentials is also interesting from the point of view of the fundamental role played by the theory of [pGC] in the discussion of [EtTh], [AbsTopII], and
[AbsTopIII] in (ii), since diﬀerentials, treated from a p-adic Hodge-theoretic point
of view, play a fundamental role in [pGC]. Finally, we observe that although anabelian
results do not play any role in the parallel transport mechanism of p-adic Teichmüller

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

127

theory, it is interesting to note that p-adic Teichmüller theory has an important application to absolute anabelian geometry [cf. [CanLift], §3, as well as the discussion
of [IUTchI], §I4; [IUTchII], Remark 4.11.4, (iii)].
(iv) Scheme-theoretic Hodge-Arakelov theory via tripodal transport:
When viewed from the point of view of the notion of tripodal transport, the fundamental theorem of Hodge-Arakelov theory, i.e., the natural isomorphism reviewed
at the beginning of §3.9, (i) [cf. also Example 2.14.3; [HASurI]; [HASurII]], may be
understood as follows:
One veriﬁes [cf. the discussion of [HASurI], §1.1] that the natural morphism
obtained by evaluating sections of an ample line bundle over the universal vectorial extension of an elliptic curve at torsion points [cf. the discussion at the
trp
trp
beginning of Example 2.14.3] is indeed an isomorphism [cf. (1 ), (5 )] by
verifying that it is an isomorphism in the case of Tate curves by means of an
trp
explicit computation involving derivatives of theta functions [cf. (4 )] and
then proceeding to parallel transport this isomorphism in the case of Tate
curves to the entire compactiﬁed moduli stack of elliptic curves in characteristic 0 by means of an explicit computation [the leading term portion of which is
reviewed in §3.9, (i)] of the degrees of the vector bundles on this compactiﬁed
moduli stack that constitute the domain and codomain of the natural morphism
trp
trp
under consideration [cf. (2 ), (3 )].
Here, we recall from the discussion of (ii) above; §3.4, (iii), (iv); Fig. 3.9, that
the theory surrounding the theta function on the Tate curve may be thought
of as a sort of function-theoretic representation of the [not necessarily p!]adic arithmetic geometry of a copy of the tripod for which the cusps “0” and
“∞” are subject to the involution symmetry that permutes these two cusps and
leaves the cusp “1” ﬁxed.
In this context, it is also perhaps of interest to recall that there is an alternative approach
to the parallel transport mechanism discussed above [i.e., computing degrees of vector
bundles on the compactiﬁed moduli stack of elliptic curves], namely, the parallel transport mechanism applied in the proof of [HASurII], Theorem 4.3, which exploits various
special properties of the Frobenius and Verschiebung morphisms in positive characteristic. Finally, we observe that although the scheme-theoretic Hodge-Arakelov
theory of [HASurI], [HASurII] is not directly related, in a logical sense, to anabelian
geometry, it nevertheless played a central role, as was discussed in detail in §3.9, in
motivating the development of inter-universal Teichmüller theory, which may be
understood as a sort of reformulation of the essential content of the scheme-theoretic

128

Hodge-Arakelov theory of [HASurI], [HASurII] via techniques based on anabelian geometry.
(v) Combinatorial anabelian geometry via tripodal transport: Let F be
a number ﬁeld, F an algebraic closure of F , X a hyperbolic curve over F , n ≥ 1 an
integer. Write Xn for the n-th conﬁguration space of X [cf., e.g., [MT], Deﬁnition 2.1,
(i)]; Πn for the étale fundamental group of Xn ×F F [for a suitable choice of basepoint];
def
Π = Π1 ; Πtpd for “Π” in the case where X is the tripod [i.e., the projective line minus
def
three points]; GF = Gal(F /F ); OutFC (Πn ) for the group of outer automorphisms of
Πn satisfying certain technical conditions [i.e., “FC”] involving the ﬁberwise subgroups
and cuspidal inertia subgroups [cf. [CombCusp], Deﬁnition 1.1, (ii), for more details].
Thus, it follows from the deﬁnition of “OutFC ” that the natural projection Xn+1 → Xn
given by forgetting the (n + 1)-st factor determines a homomorphism
φn+1 : OutFC (Πn+1 ) → OutFC (Πn )
[cf. the situation discussed in [NodNon], Theorem B]; the natural action of GF on
Xn ×F F determines an outer Galois representation
ρn : GF → OutFC (Πn )
def

[cf. the situation discussed in [NodNon], Theorem C]. Write ρ = ρ1 , ρtpd for “ρ” in the
case where X is the tripod. Then
the proof of the injectivity [cf. [NodNon], Theorem C] of
ρ : GF → OutFC (Π)
given in [NodNon] is perhaps the most transparent/prototypical example of
the phenomenon of tripodal transport.
Indeed, this proof may be summarized as follows:
One makes the [“relatively trivial”! — cf. (2
factorization

trp

)] observation that ρ admits a

ρ = φ2 ◦ φ3 ◦ ρ3 : GF → OutFC (Π3 ) → OutFC (Π2 ) → OutFC (Π)
trp

— which allows one to reduce [cf. (2 )] the veriﬁcation of the desired injectivity
def
trp
trp
of ρ [cf. (1 ), (5 )] to the veriﬁcation of the injectivity of φ23 = φ2 ◦ φ3 [cf.
trp
trp
trp
(3 ), (4 )] and ρ3 [cf. (4 )]. Then:
· One observes that the injectivity of φ23 depends only on the type
“(g, r)” [i.e., the genus and number of punctures] of X, hence may

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

129

be veriﬁed in the case of — i.e., may be “parallel transported”
trp
[cf. (3 )] to the case of — a totally degenerate pointed stable
curve, i.e., a pointed curve obtained by gluing together some collectrp
tion of tripods along the various cusps of the tripods [cf. (4 )]. On
the other hand, in the case of such a totally degenerate pointed stable
curve, the desired injectivity [i.e., of the analogue of “φ23 ”] may be
veriﬁed by applying the purely combinatorial/group-theoretic techniques of combinatorial anabelian geometry developed in [CombCusp], [NodNon] [cf. [NodNon], Theorem B].
· One veriﬁes the injectivity of ρ3 by applying a certain natural homomorphism called the tripod homomorphism
τ : OutFC (Π3 ) → OutFC (Πtpd )
[cf. [CbTpII], Theorem C, (ii)], which satisﬁes the property that
ρtpd = τ ◦ ρ3 : GF → OutFC (Π3 ) → OutFC (Πtpd ) and hence allows
one to conclude the injectivity of ρ3 from the well-known injectivity
trp
result of Belyi to the eﬀect that ρtpd is injective [cf. (4 )].
Here, it is interesting to note, especially in light of the discussion of anabelian results and
diﬀerentials in the ﬁnal portions of (i), (ii), (iii), the central role played by combinatorial anabelian geometry — i.e., in particular, various combinatorial versions of the
Grothendieck Conjecture such as [NodNon], Theorem A — in the parallel transport
mechanism discussed above. Such combinatorial versions of the Grothendieck Conjecture concern group-theoretic characterizations of the decomposition of a pointed stable
curve into various irreducible components glued together along the nodes of the curve.
This sort of decomposition may be interpreted as a sort of discrete version of the notion
of a diﬀerential, i.e., which may be thought of as a decomposition of a ring/scheme
structure into inﬁnitesimals. Finally, we emphasize that this proof of the injectivity of ρ
is a particularly striking example of the phenomenon of tripodal transport, in the
sense that the issue of relating the injectivity of ρ for an arbitrary X to the injectivity
of ρtpd , i.e., in the case of the tripod, seems, a priori, to be entirely intractable, at least
so long as one restricts oneself to morphisms between schemes [cf. the discussion in the
ﬁnal portion of (i)].
(vi) Tripodal transport and Bogomolov’s proof: Often, as in the examples
discussed in (ii), (iii), (iv), above, the tripod that appears in instances of the phenomenon of tripodal transport is a tripod in which the cusps “0” and “∞” play a
distinguished, but symmetric role, which is somewhat diﬀerent from the role played by
the cusp “1”. When considered from this point of view, the tripod may thought of
as the underlying scheme of the group scheme Gm [with its origin removed], hence, in

Shinichi Mochizuki

130

particular, as a sort of algebraic version of the topological circle S1 . If one thinks of
the tripod in this way, i.e., as corresponding to S1 , then the proof given by
Bogomolov [cf. [ABKP], [Zh], [BogIUT], as well as the discussion of §4.3, (iii),
below] of the geometric version of the Szpiro Conjecture over the complex numbers may also be understood as an instance, albeit in a somewhat generalized
sense, of the technique of tripodal transport.
To explain further, we introduce notation as follows:
∼

· Write Autπ (R) for the group of self-homeomorphisms R → R that commute
with translation by π ∈ R. Thus, if we think of S1 as the quotient R/(2π·Z), then
Autπ (R) may be understood as the group of self-homeomorphisms of R that lift
elements of the group Aut+ (S1 ) of orientation-preserving self-homeomorphisms
of S1 that commute with multiplication by −1 on S1 . In particular, we have a
natural exact sequence 1 → 2π · Z → Autπ (R) → Aut+ (S1 ) → 1.
∼
· Write Autπ (R≥0 ) for the group of self-homeomorphisms R≥0 → R≥0 that
stabilize and restrict to the identity on the subset π · N ⊆ R≥0 .
· Write R|π| for the set of Autπ (R≥0 )-orbits of R≥0 [relative to the natural
action of Autπ (R≥0 ) on R≥0 ]. Thus,
!

!

R|π| =
∪
n∈N { [n · π] }
m∈N { [(m · π, (m + 1) · π)] }
— where we use the notation “[−]” to denote the element in R|π| determined
by an element or nonempty subset of R≥0 that lies in a single Autπ (R≥0 )-orbit;
we use the notation “(−, −)” to denote an open interval in R≥0 ; we observe
that the natural order relation on R≥0 induces a natural order relation on R|π| .
· Write δ sup : Autπ (R) → R|π| for the map that assigns to α ∈ Autπ (R) the
element sup(δ(α)) ∈ R|π| , where we observe that
def

δ(α) = { [ |α(x) − x| ] | x ∈ R } ⊆ R|π|
is a ﬁnite subset [cf. the deﬁnition of Autπ (R)!] of R|π| , and that [as is easily veriﬁed, by observing that for any β ∈ Autπ (R) and x, y ∈ R such that x ≤ y, there
exists a γ ∈ Autπ (R≥0 ) such that β(y)−β(x) = β((y −x)+x)−β(x) = γ(y −x)]
the assignments δ(−), δ sup (−) are Autπ (R)-conjugacy invariant.
· Write SL2 (R)∼ for universal covering of SL2 (R). Thus, we have a natural
central extension of topological groups 1 → Z → SL2 (R)∼ → SL2 (R) → 1. By
def
composing the natural embedding S1 → R2× = R2 \ {(0, 0)} with the natudef
ral projection R2×  R2∠ = R2× /R>0 , we obtain a natural homeomorphism
∼
S1 → R2∠ , hence [by considering the natural action of SL2 (R) on R2× , R2∠ ]
natural actions
SL2 (R)  S1 ; SL2 (R)∼  R

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

[where we think of R as the universal covering of S1 = R/(2π · Z)], the latter of
which determines a natural injective homomorphism
SL2 (R)∼ → Autπ (R)
[which, at times, we shall use to think of SL2 (R)∼ as a subgroup of Autπ (R)]. We
may assume without loss of generality that the generator “1” of Z → SL2 (R)∼
was chosen so as to act on R in the positive direction.
def
· Write SL2 (Z)∼ = SL2 (R)∼ ×SL2 (R) SL2 (Z). Thus, we have a natural central
extension of discrete groups 1 → Z → SL2 (Z)∼ → SL2 (Z) → 1. One shows
easily [e.g., by considering the discriminant modular form, as in [BogIUT]] that
the abelianization of SL2 (Z)∼ is isomorphic to Z, and hence that there exists a
unique surjective homomorphism
χ : SL2 (Z)∼  Z
that maps positive elements of Z → SL2 (Z)∼ to positive elements of Z.
In some sense, the fundamental phenomenon that underlies Bogomolov’s proof is the
following elementary fact:
Whereas the SL2 (Z)-conjugacy classes of the unipotent elements
"
#
1 m
m def
τ
=
∈ SL2 (Z)
0 1
diﬀer for diﬀerent positive integers m, the SL2 (R)-conjugacy classes of these
elements coincide for diﬀerent positive integers m.
In the context of Bogomolov’s proof, if one thinks of SL2 (Z) as the topological fundamental group of the moduli stack of elliptic curves over the complex numbers, then
such unipotent elements arise as the images in SL2 (Z) — via the [outer] homomorphism
induced on topological fundamental groups by the classifying morphism associated to
a family of one-dimensional complex tori over a hyperbolic Riemann surface S of ﬁnite
type — of the natural generators of cuspidal inertia groups of the topological fundamental group of S. In this situation, the positive integer m then corresponds to the
valuation of the q-parameter at a cusp of S. Next, we recall [cf., e.g., [BogIUT], (B1)]
that unipotent elements of SL2 (R) admit canonical liftings to SL2 (R)∼ . In particular, it makes sense to apply both δ sup and χ to the canonical lifting τ m ∈ SL2 (Z)∼
of τ m . Since χ is a homomorphism, we have
χ(τ m ) = m

132

Shinichi Mochizuki

[cf., e.g., [BogIUT], (B3)]. On the other hand, since δ sup (−) is Autπ (R)- [hence, in
particular, SL2 (R)∼ -] conjugacy invariant, we have
δ sup (τ m ) < [π]
[cf., e.g., [BogIUT], (B1)] for arbitrary m. It is precisely by applying both χ and δ sup (−)
to a certain natural relation [arising from the image in SL2 (Z) of the “usual deﬁning
relation” of the topological fundamental group of S] between elements ∈ SL2 (Z) lifted
to SL2 (Z)∼ that one is able to derive the geometric version of the Szpiro inequality,
that is to say, to bound the height of the given family of one-dimensional complex tori
— i.e., more concretely, in essence, the sum of the “m”’s arising from the various cusps
of S [cf., e.g., [BogIUT], (B4)] — by a number that depends only on the genus and
number of cusps of S and not on the “m”’s themselves [cf., e.g., [BogIUT], (B2), (B5)].
From the point of view of the technique of tripodal transport, one may summarize
this argument as follows:
one bounds the height [i.e., essentially, the sum of the “m”’s] of the given
trp
family of one-dimensional complex tori [cf. (5 )] — which is a reﬂection
trp
of the holomorphic moduli of this family [cf. (1 )] — by combining a
trp
“relatively trivial” [cf. (2 )] object χ arising from the holomorphic structure of the moduli stack of elliptic curves over the complex numbers [i.e.,
from the discriminant modular form] with the parallel transport mechatrp
nism [cf. (3 )] given by passing from the “holomorphic” SL2 (Z), SL2 (Z)∼
to the “real analytic” SL2 (R), SL2 (R)∼ , i.e., in essence, by passing to the
Aut+ (S1 )-invariant geometry of S1 , as reﬂected in the Autπ (R)-conjugacy
trp
invariant map δ sup : Autπ (R) → R|π| [cf. (4 )].
From the point of view of the analogy [cf. the discussion of (ii) above; [BogIUT]] between
Bogomolov’s proof and inter-universal Teichmüller theory, we observe that:
· The canonical lifts discussed above of unipotent elements ∈ SL2 (Z) to
SL2 (Z)∼ correspond to the theory of the étale theta function [i.e., [EtTh]]
in inter-universal Teichmüller theory.
· The Aut+ (S1 )-invariant geometry of S1 , as reﬂected in the Autπ (R)conjugacy invariant map δ sup : Autπ (R) → R|π| , corresponds to the theory
est
of mono-analytic log-shells and related log-volume estimates [cf. (12 );
§3.7, (iv); [IUTchIV], §1, §2] in inter-universal Teichmüller theory. In particular, Aut+ (S1 )-/Autπ (R)-indeterminacies in Bogomolov’s proof — in which
both the additive [i.e., corresponding to unipotent subgroups of SL2 (R)] and
multiplicative [i.e., corresponding to toral, or equivalently, compact subgroups
of SL2 (R)] dimensions of SL2 (R) are “confused” within the single dimension of S1 — correspond to the indeterminacies (Ind1), (Ind2), (Ind3) of

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

133

inter-universal Teichmüller theory.
· The role played by SL2 (Z), SL2 (Z)∼ , χ corresponds to the role played by
the ﬁxed arithmetic holomorphic structure of the RHS of the Θ-link [cf.
est
est
est
est
est
est
est
(1 ), (6 ), (7 ), (8 ), (9 ), (10 ), (11 )] in the argument of §3.7, (ii).
By contrast, the role played by SL2 (R), SL2 (R)∼ , δ sup (−) corresponds to the
est
est
est
est
role played by the multiradial representation [cf. (2 ), (3 ), (4 ), (5 )]
in the argument of §3.7, (ii).
In particular, one has natural correspondences
SL2 (R), SL2 (R)∼ , δ sup (−)
SL2 (Z), SL2 (Z)∼ , χ

←→ [IUTchIII], Theorem 3.11;
←→ [IUTchIII], Corollary 3.12 (⇐= Theorem 3.11)

— i.e., where, more precisely, the RHS of the latter correspondence is to be understood as referring to the derivation of [IUTchIII], Corollary 3.12, from [IUTchIII], Theorem 3.11. These last two correspondences are particularly interesting in light of the
well-documented historical fact that the theory/estimates in Bogomolov’s proof related
to SL2 (R), SL2 (R)∼ , δ sup (−) were apparently already known to Milnor in the 1950’s
[cf. [MlWd]], while the idea of combining these estimates with the theory surrounding SL2 (Z), SL2 (Z)∼ , χ appears to have been unknown until the work of Bogomolov
around the year 2000 [cf. [ABKP]]. Moreover, these last two correspondences — and,
indeed, the entire analogy between Bogomolov’s proof and inter-universal Teichmüller
theory — are also of interest in the following sense:
Bogomolov’s proof only involves working with elements ∈ SL2 (R), SL2 (R)∼
that arise from topological fundamental groups, hence may be applied not only to
algebraic/holomorphic families of elliptic curves, but also to arbitrary topological families of one-dimensional complex tori that satisfy suitable conditions
at the points of degeneration, i.e., “bad reduction”.
This aspect of Bogomolov’s proof is reminiscent of the fact that the initial Θ-data of
inter-universal Teichmüller theory [cf. §3.3, (i)] essentially only involves data that arises
from various arithmetic fundamental groups associated to an elliptic curve over a
number ﬁeld. In particular, this aspect of Bogomolov’s proof suggests strongly that
perhaps, in the future, some version of inter-universal Teichmüller theory could be developed in which the initial Θ-data of the current version of inter-universal Teichmüller
theory is replaced by some collection of topological groups that satisﬁes conditions analogous to the conditions satisﬁed by the collection of arithmetic fundamental groups
that appear in the initial Θ-data of the current version of inter-universal Teichmüller
theory, but that does not necessarily arise, in a literal sense, from an elliptic curve over
a number ﬁeld.

§ 3.11.

Mathematical analysis of elementary conceptual discomfort

We conclude our exposition, in the present §3, of the main ideas of inter-universal
Teichmüller theory by returning to our discussion of the point of view of a hypothetical
high-school student, in the style of §1. Often the sort of deep conceptual discomfort that such a hypothetical high-school student might experience when attempting
to understand various elementary ideas in mathematics may be analyzed and elucidated more constructively when viewed from the more sophisticated point of view of a
professional mathematician. Moreover, this sort of approach to mathematical analysis of conceptual discomfort may be applied to the analysis of the discomfort that
some mathematicians appear to have experienced when studying various central ideas
of inter-universal Teichmüller theory, such as the log- and Θ-links.
(i) Proof by mathematical induction: Some high-school students encounter
substantial discomfort in accepting the notion of proof by mathematical induction,
for instance, in the case of proofs of facts such as the following:
Example 3.11.1.
integer n, it holds that

Sum of squares of consecutive integers. For any positive
n


j2 =

1
6 n(2n + 1)(n + 1).

j=1

Such discomfort is at times expressed by assertions to the eﬀect that they cannot believe
that it is not possible to simply give some sort of more direct argument that applies
to all positive integers at once — i.e., without resorting to such indirect and “nonintuitive” devices of reasoning as the induction hypothesis — in the style of proofs of
facts such as the following:
Example 3.11.2.
holds that

Square of a sum. For any positive integers n and m, it
(n + m)2 = n2 + 2nm + m2 .

On the other hand, from the more sophisticated point of view of a professional mathematician, the situation surrounding the usual proofs of these facts in Examples 3.11.1,
3.11.2 may be understood as follows:
The fact in Example 3.11.2 in fact holds for arbitrary elements “n” and “m” in
an arbitrary commutative ring and hence, in particular, is best understood
as a consequence of the axioms of a commutative ring. By contrast, the
fact in Example 3.11.1 is a fact that depends on the structure of the particular
ring Z, or, essentially equivalently, on the structure of the particular monoid
N. In particular, it is natural that any proof of the fact in Example 3.11.1

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

135

should depend, in an essential way, on the deﬁnition of [Z or] N. On the other
hand, the logical structure of an argument by mathematical induction is, in
essence, simply a rephrasing of the very deﬁnition of N.
In light of this state of aﬀairs, although it seems to be rather diﬃcult to formulate and
prove, in a rigorous way, the assertion that there does not exist a proof of the fact in
Example 3.11.1 that does not essentially involve mathematical induction, at least from
the standard point of view of mathematics at, say, the undergraduate or graduate level,
it does not seem natural or reasonable to expect the existence of a proof of the fact in
Example 3.11.1 that does not essentially involve mathematical induction.
(ii) Identiﬁcation of the domain and codomain of the logarithm: A somewhat diﬀerent situation from the situation discussed in (i) may be seen in the case of
the notion of a logarithm. Some high-school students encounter substantial discomfort
in accepting the notion of a logarithm on the grounds that a number in the exponent
of an expression such as
ab
[where, say, a, b ∈ R>0 ], i.e., “b”, seems to have a “fundamentally diﬀerent meaning”
from a number not in the exponent, i.e., “a”. In light of this “fundamental diﬀerence in
meaning” between numbers in and not in the exponent, a function such as the logarithm,
i.e., which “converts” [cf. such relations as log(ab ) = b · log(a)] numbers in the exponent
into numbers not in the exponent, seems, from the point of view of such students, to be
“inﬁnitely mysterious” or intractable in nature. From the point of view of a professional
mathematician, this sort of “fundamental diﬀerence in meaning” between numbers in
and not in the exponent may be understood as the diﬀerence between iteration of the
monoid operation in the underlying multiplicative and additive monoids of the
topological ﬁeld R, i.e., as the diﬀerence between the multiplicative and additive
structures of the topological ﬁeld R. The [natural] logarithm on positive real numbers
may then be understood as a certain natural isomorphism
∼

log : R>0 → R
between the underlying [positive] multiplicative and additive monoids of the topological
ﬁeld R. Thus, the substantial discomfort that some high-school students encounter in
accepting the notion of a logarithm may be understood as
a diﬃculty in accepting the identiﬁcation of the underlying additive monoid
of the topological ﬁeld R that contains the multiplicative monoid R>0 in the
domain of log with the underlying additive monoid of the topological ﬁeld R
that appears in the codomain of log on the grounds that the map log is not

136

Shinichi Mochizuki

compatible with [i.e., does not arise from a ring homomorphism between] the
ring structures in its domain and codomain.
Here, we recall that this identiﬁcation is typically “taken for granted” or “regarded
as not requiring any justiﬁcation” in discussions concerning the natural logarithm on
positive real numbers. A similar identiﬁcation that is “taken for granted” or “regarded
as not requiring any justiﬁcation” may be seen in typical discussions concerning the
p-adic logarithm, as well as in the closely related identiﬁcation, in the context of
p-adic Hodge theory, of the copy of “Zp ” lying inside the base ﬁeld of a p-adic
variety with the copy of “Zp ” that acts on certain types of étale local systems on the
variety [cf. the discussion of [EtTh], Remark 2.16.2; the discussion in the ﬁnal portion of
[Pano], §3; the discussion of “mysterious tensor products” in [BogIUT]]. By contrast, in
the case of the log-link in inter-universal Teichmüller theory, it is of crucial importance,
as discussed in the latter portion of §3.3, (ii),
to distinguish the domain and codomain of the log-link, since confusion of
the domain and codomain of the log-link — i.e., confusion of the multiplicative
and additive structures that occur in the domain of the Θ-link — would yield
a situation in which the Θ-link is not well-deﬁned.
In particular, interestingly enough, although the substantial discomfort that some
high-school students experience when studying the logarithm is inconsistent with the
point of view typically taken in discussions of the natural logarithm on positive real
numbers or the p-adic logarithm in the context of p-adic Hodge theory, this substantial
discomfort of some high-school students is, somewhat remarkably, consistent with the
situation surrounding the log-link in the context of the log-theta-lattice in interuniversal Teichmüller theory.
(iii) Conceptual content of the ABC inequality: Yet another kind of situation — which resembles, in certain aspects, the situation discussed in (i), but is related,
in other aspects, to the situation discussed in (ii) — may be seen in elementary discussions of the ABC inequality for rational integers [i.e., an immediate consequence of
the Szpiro Conjecture inequality discussed in §3.7, (iv)]. This most fundamental version
of the ABC inequality may be stated as follows:
There exists a positive real number λ such that for all triples (a, b, c) of relatively
prime positive integers satisfying a + b = c, it holds that
  λ
p .
abc ≤
p|abc

Here, we observe that whereas the left-hand side “LHS” of this inequality is a quantity
that measures the size — i.e., from a more advanced point of view, the height — of

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

137

the triple (a, b, c) relative to the additive structure of the additive monoid N, the
right-hand side “RHS” of this inequality is a quantity that arises from thinking of
the triple (a, b, c) in terms of the multiplicative monoid N≥1 modulo the quotient
relation “p ∼ pn ” [for n a positive integer] that identiﬁes primes with arbitrary positive
powers of primes. Note that since the multiplicative structure of N≥1 may be derived
immediately from the additive structure of N — e.g., by thinking of “a · b” as the sum
a + · · · + a of b copies of a — one may also think of the LHS of the above inequality
as a measure of the size of the triple (a, b, c) relative to the ring structure of Z [i.e.,
which involves both the additive and multiplicative structures of Z]. In particular, one
may understand, from a more conceptual point of view, the “trivial inequality” in the
opposite direction, i.e.,

p
abc ≥
p|abc

as a reﬂection of the elementary observation that the multiplicative monoid N≥1 considered modulo “∼” may be “easily derived from” — or, in other words, is “dominated/controlled by” — the additive structure/ring structure of Z:


additive structure/ring structure of Z



multiplicative monoid N≥1 modulo ∼ .
By contrast, the fundamental form of the ABC inequality recalled above may be understood, at a more conceptual level, as the assertion that, up to a certain “indeterminacy”
[corresponding to “λ”], the multiplicative monoid N≥1 considered modulo “∼” is suﬃciently potent as to dominate/control the additive structure/ring structure of Z:


additive structure/ring structure of Z


≺
multiplicative monoid N≥1 modulo ∼
— a somewhat startling assertion, since, at least from an a priori point of view, passing
from, say, the ring Z to the multiplicative monoid N≥1 modulo ∼ appears to involve
quite a substantial loss of data/structure. On the other hand, this conceptual
interpretation of the ABC inequality is remarkably reminiscent of the Θ-link [cf. the
discussion of the log-link in (ii)] and multiradial representation of inter-universal
Teichmüller theory, which in eﬀect assert [cf. the discussion of §3.7, (i)] that
the multiplicative monoids/Frobenioids, together with Galois actions, that
appear in the data glued together via the Θ-link are suﬃciently potent as to
dominate/control up to certain indeterminacies — via the multiradial representation of the Θ-pilot — the ring structure/ arithmetic holomorphic
structure in the domain of the Θ-link, i.e.,

138

Shinichi Mochizuki




ring structure that gives to rise to Θ-pilot


≺
multiplicative monoids/Frobenioids and Galois actions in Θ-link .

That is to say, in summary,
the conceptual interpretation of the ABC inequality discussed above is
already suﬃciently rich as to strongly suggest numerous characteristic features
of inter-universal Teichmüller theory, i.e., such as the multiradial representation, up to suitable indeterminacies, of various distinct ring structures
related by the much weaker [a priori] data — i.e., multiplicative monoids/
Frobenioids and Galois actions — that appears in the Θ-link.
In particular, from the point of view of this conceptual interpretation of the ABC
inequality, such characteristic features of inter-universal Teichmüller theory are quite
natural and indeed appear remarkably close to being “inevitable” in some suitable sense
[cf. the discussion of (i)]. Finally, we observe that this interplay, with regard to “domination/control”, between rigid ring structures [which determine the “height”] and
weaker structures with indeterminacies [for which primes are identiﬁed with their
positive powers] via the multiradial representation is remarkably reminiscent of the
discussion in §3.10, (vi), of the interplay, in the context of Bogomolov’s proof of the
geometric version of the Szpiro Conjecture, between the rigid SL2 (Z) [where conjugacy classes of unipotent elements determine the “height”] and the less rigid SL2 (R)
[where conjugacy classes of unipotent elements identify arbitrary positive powers of such
elements] via “δ sup (−)”.
(iv) Logical AND vs. logical OR, multiple copies, and multiradiality: As
discussed at the beginning of §3.3, (ii), each lattice point in the log-theta-lattice [i.e.,
each “•” in Fig. 3.6] represents a Θ±ell N F -Hodge theater, which may be thought
of as a sort of miniature model of the conventional scheme/ring theory surrounding the
given initial Θ-data. In the following discussion, we shall use the notation “(−) R”, where
(−) ∈ {†, ‡}, to denote a particular such model of conventional scheme/ring theory; we
shall write “∗” for some F ×μ -prime-strip [i.e., some collection of data that is isomorphic either to the domain data (aΘ ), (bΘ ), (cΘ ) or, equivalently, to the codomain data
(aq ), (bq ), (cq ) of the Θ-link — cf. the discussion of the latter portion of §3.7, (i); the
discussion of §3.10, (ii); [IUTchII], Deﬁnition 4.9, (viii)], regarded up to isomorphism.
Thus, the Θ-link may be thought of as consisting of the assignments
∗ → ‡ q N ∈ ‡ R;

∗ → † q ∈ † R

— where N = 1, 2, . . . , j 2 , . . . , (l )2 ; “‡ q N ” denotes the domain data (aΘ ), (bΘ ), (cΘ )
of the Θ-link, which belongs [i.e., “∈”] to the model of conventional scheme/ring theory

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

139

“‡ R” in the domain of the Θ-link; “† q” denotes the codomain data (aq ), (bq ), (cq ) of the
Θ-link, which belongs [i.e., “∈”] to the model of conventional scheme/ring theory “† R”
in the codomain of the Θ-link. In this context, we observe that one fundamental —
but entirely elementary! — issue that arises when considering these two assignments
“∗ → ‡ q N ”, “∗ → † q” is the issue of
what precisely is the logical relationship between these two assignments that
constitute the Θ-link?
In a word, the answer to this question — which underlies, in an essential way, the entire
logical structure of inter-universal Teichmüller theory — is as follows:
the Θ-link is to be understood — as a matter of deﬁnition! — as a construction
with respect to which these two assignments are simultaneously valid, that
is to say, from the point of view of symbolic logical relators,


∗ → ‡ q N



∧



∗ → † q



— i.e., where “∧” denotes the logical relator “AND” [cf. the discussion of the
“distinct labels approach”, “∧” in [IUTchIII], Remark 3.11.1, (vii); [IUTchIII],
Remark 3.12.2, (ii), (citw ), (f itw )].
Here, we observe that:
(1

and

(2

and

) If one forgets the distinct labels “‡”, “†”, then the resulting collections of data
q N ∈ R, q ∈ R are diﬀerent. In particular, if one deletes the distinct labels “‡”,
“†”, then the crucial logical relator “∧” no longer holds [i.e., leads immediately
to a contradiction!]. That is to say, it is precisely by distinguishing the two copies
“‡ R”, “† R” that one obtains a well-deﬁned construction of the Θ-link, as described
above. This situation is reminiscent of the discussion of distinct copies in §1.3.
) One way to understand the notion of multiradiality in the case of the multiradial
representation of the Θ-pilot is as the [highly nontrivial!] property of an algorithm that allows one to maintain the validity of this crucial logical relator “∧”
throughout the execution of the algorithm — cf. the discussion of “simultaneous
execution/meaningfulness” in §2.9; §3.4, (i); §3.7, (i), as well as the discussion
of the properties “IPL”, “SHE”, “APT”, “HIS” in [IUTchIII], Remark 3.11.1. This
∼
point of view is reminiscent of the single vector bundle “p∗1 F|S log → p∗2 F|S log ”

of §3.1, (v), (3 ) [i.e., which serves simultaneously as a pull-back via p1 and as a
pull-back via p2 !], as well as of the discussion of §1.4, §1.5, §1.6 [i.e., of integration
on R2 , as opposed to R].

(3

and

and

) It is precisely by applying this interpretation [cf. (2 )] of multiradiality — i.e.,
maintenance of the validity of this crucial logical relator “∧” throughout the exest
ecution of the multiradial algorithm — that one may conclude [cf. §3.7, (ii), (10 ),
est
est
(11 ), (12 )], in an essentially formal fashion, that the multiradial representation
of the Θ-pilot, regarded up to suitable indeterminacies, is — simultaneously [cf.
“∧”!] — a representation of the original q-pilot in the codomain of the Θ-link.

Put another way, one fundamental cause of certain frequently [and, at times, somewhat vociferously!] articulated misunderstandings of inter-universal Teichmüller theory
is precisely
the misunderstanding that the Θ-link is to be understood — as a matter
of deﬁnition! — as a construction with respect to which the two assignments
“∗ → ‡ q N ”, “∗ → † q” are not necessarily required to be simultaneously
valid, that is to say, from the point of view of symbolic logical relators,


∗ → ‡ q N



∨



∗ → † q



— i.e., where “∨” denotes the logical relator “OR”.
Here, we observe that, if one takes the point of view of this misunderstanding, then:
or

(1 ) The logical relator “∨” remains valid even if one forgets the distinct labels
“‡”, “†”. In particular, the use of distinct copies throughout inter-universal Teichmüller theory seems entirely superﬂuous — cf. the discussion of distinct copies
in §1.3.

(11 ), (12 )], in an essentially formal fashion, that the multiradial representation
of the Θ-pilot, regarded up to suitable indeterminacies, is — simultaneously [i.e.,
“∧”!] — a representation of the original q-pilot in the codomain of the Θ-link
appears somewhat abrupt, mysterious, or entirely unjustiﬁed.
Thus, in summary, confusion, in the context of the Θ-link and the multiradial representation of the Θ-pilot, between the logical relators “∧” and “∨” — which is,
in essence, an entirely elementary issue [cf. the discussion of §1.3, as well as of
[IUTchIII], Remark 3.11.1, (vii); [IUTchIII], Remark 3.12.2, (ii), (ctoy ), (f toy )] — has

the potential to lead to very deep repercussions with regard to understanding the
essential logical structure of inter-universal Teichmüller theory. Finally, we conclude
the present discussion by observing that one way to approach the task of understanding
these aspects of the essential logical structure of inter-universal Teichmüller theory is
by considering the following elementary combinatorial and numerical models:
Example 3.11.3.
Elementary combinatorial model of “∧ vs. “∨”, multiple copies, and multiradiality. The ideas discussed in the present §3.11, (iv), may
be summarized/expressed simply, in terms of elementary combinatorics, as in Fig. 3.22
below. Here, “∗” corresponds, in the above discussion, to “∗”, i.e., to some abstract
F ×μ -prime-strip; each of the boxes in the upper left- and right-hand corners of the
diagram corresponds, in the above discussion, to “(−) R”, where (−) ∈ {†, ‡}, i.e., to
some abstract Θ±ell N F -Hodge theater; each of these boxes is equipped with two distinct
substructures “(−) 0”, “(−) 1” [which may be thought of as corresponding, in the above
discussion, respectively, to (−) q, (−) q N ] such that ∗ is glued [cf. the horizontal arrows
emanating from either side of ∗] to ‡ 1, † 0; the lower box in the center is to be understood
as a copy of either of the two upper boxes on the left and right whose relationship to
∗ is, by deﬁnition, indeterminate, i.e., ∗ corresponds either to ◦ 0 or to ◦ 1; the diagonal
arrows on the left and right then correspond to the operation of forgetting the datum of
which of “(−) 0”, “(−) 1” is glued to ∗. Thus, the central portion of Fig. 3.22, delimited
by dotted lines on either side, is to be thought of as containing objects that are, by
deﬁnition, neutral/symmetric with respect to the portion marked with a “‡” on the
left and the portion marked with a “†” on the right. Here, the gluings of ∗ in the upper
portion of the diagram are to be understood as being [by deﬁnition!] simultaneously
valid, i.e.,




∧
∗ → † 0
∗ → ‡ 1
— a situation that is consistent/well-deﬁned precisely because the two labels “†” and “‡”
and
are regarded as being distinct [cf. (1 )]. In particular, this upper “∧” portion of the
diagram may be regarded as a sort of tautological, or initial, multiradial algorithm [cf.
and
(2 )], which is essentially equivalent to the “distinct labels approach” discussed
in [IUTchIII], Remark 3.11.1, (vii). Then the operation of passing, via the diagonal
arrows, from the upper “∧” portion of the diagram to the lower central box — i.e., to




∨
∗ → ◦ 0
∗ → ◦ 1
— may be understood as corresponding to the “forced identiﬁcation approach”
discussed in [IUTchIII], Remark 3.11.1, (vii), or [alternatively and essentially equivalently!], from the point of view of the above discussion, as corresponding to the passage
from “∧” to “∨” [where we recall that, in general, ∧ =⇒ ∨], i.e., to



∨
∗ → † 0
∗ → ‡ 1

or

[cf. (1 ), (2 )]. Here, we observe that this “∨” approach may also be regarded as a sort
and
or
of “trivial multiradial algorithm” [cf. (2 ), (2 )], i.e., in the sense, that, in general, it
holds that A ∨ B is equivalent to (A ∨ B) ∧ (A ∨ B).

Fig. 3.22: Elementary combinatorial model of the Θ-link
Example 3.11.4.
Elementary numerical model of “∧ vs. “∨”, multiple
copies, and multiradiality. Alternatively, the ideas exposed in the present §3.11,
(iv), may be summarized/expressed in terms of elementary numerical manipulations,
as follows. First of all, the overall general logical ﬂow of inter-universal Teichmüller
theory — i.e., starting from the deﬁnition of the Θ-link, proceeding to the multiradial
representation of the Θ-pilot [cf. [IUTchIII], Theorem 3.11], and ﬁnally, culminating
in a ﬁnal numerical estimate [cf. [IUTchIII], Corollary 3.12] — may be represented by
means of real numbers A, B ∈ R>0 and , N ∈ R such that 0 ≤  < 1 in the following
way:
· Θ-link:



def

N = −2B





∧


def
N = −A ;

· multiradial representation of the Θ-pilot:


N = −2A + 

∧




N = −A ;

· ﬁnal numerical estimate:
−2A +  = −A, hence A = , i.e., A < 1.
and

and

Thus, the Θ-link [cf. (1 )] and multiradial representation of the Θ-pilot [cf. (2 )] are
meaningful/nontrivial precisely because of the logical relator “∧”, whose use obligates
one, in the deﬁnition of the Θ-link, to consider a priori distinct real numbers A, B;

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

143

the passage from the multiradial representation of the Θ-pilot to the ﬁnal numerical
and
estimate is immediate/straightforward/logically transparent [cf. (3 )]. By contrast, if
one replaces “∧” by “∨”, then our elementary numerical model of the logical structure
of inter-universal Teichmüller theory takes the following form:
· “∨” version of Θ-link:

 def
N = −2B

∨



def

N = −A



[cf.




def
N = −2A

∨




def
N = −A ];

· “∨” version of multiradial representation of the Θ-pilot:


N = −2A + 

∨




N = −A ;

· ﬁnal numerical estimate:
−2A +  = −A, hence A = , i.e., A < 1.
That is to say, the use of distinct real numbers A, B in the deﬁnition of the “∨” version
or
of Θ-link seems entirely superﬂuous [cf. (1 )]. This motivates one to identify A and
B — i.e., to suppose “for the sake of simplicity” that A = B — which then has the
eﬀect of rendering the deﬁnition of the original “∧” version of the Θ-link invalid/selfand
or
contradictory [cf. (1 ), (1 )]. Once one identiﬁes A and B, i.e., once one supposes
“for the sake of simplicity” that A = B, the passage from the “∨” version of Θ-link
to the [resulting “∨” version of the] multiradial representation of the Θ-pilot seems
or
entirely meaningless/devoid of any interesting content [cf. (2 )]. The passage from the
[resulting meaningless “∨” version of the] multiradial representation of the Θ-pilot to
the ﬁnal numerical estimate then seems abrupt/mysterious/entirely unjustiﬁed, i.e., put
another way, looks as if
one erroneously replaced the “∨” in the meaningless “∨” version of the multiradial representation of the Θ-pilot by an “∧” without any mathematical
or
justiﬁcation whatsoever [cf. (3 )].
This is precisely the pernicious chain of misunderstandings that has given rise to
a substantial amount of unnecessary confusion concerning inter-universal Teichmüller
theory.
(v) Closed loops and two-dimensionality: In the context of the discussion of
(iv), it is useful to observe that one way to think of the construction algorithm of the
multiradial representation of the Θ-pilot is as follows [cf. the discussion of [IUTchIII],
Remark 3.9.5, (viii)]:

Shinichi Mochizuki

144

cld

) This construction may be thought of as a construction of a certain subquotient
of the portion of the log-theta-lattice on the right-hand side of Fig. 3.6 [i.e., consisting
of two vertical lines of log-links joined by a single horizontal Θ-link] that restricts
to the identity on the vertical line of log-links that contains the codomain of the
Θ-link.
) Alternatively, this subquotient may be thought of as a sort of projection of the
the “Θ-intertwining” [i.e., the structure on an abstract F ×μ -primestrip as the F ×μ -prime-strip arising from the Θ-pilot object appearing
in the domain of the Θ-link]
— up to suitable indeterminacies — onto
the “q-intertwining” [i.e., the structure on an abstract F ×μ -primestrip as the F ×μ -prime-strip arising from the q-pilot object appearing
in the codomain of the Θ-link].

Here, we observe further [cf. the discussion of §3.10, (ii)] that this algorithm converts
any collection of input data — i.e., any F ×μ -prime-strip — into output data
that is expressed in terms of the arithmetic holomorphic structure of the input
data F ×μ -prime-strip, hence makes it possible to construct, in eﬀect,
(3

) a single F ×μ -prime-strip that is simultaneously equipped with both the
q-intertwining and the Θ-intertwining, regarded up to suitable indeterminacies
[cf. discussion of the crucial logical relator “∧” in (iv) above; the discussion of the
ﬁnal portion of [IUTchIII], Remark 3.9.5, (ix)].

cld

Put another way, this algorithm allows one to
(4

) construct a closed loop — i.e., from a given input data [q-intertwined!] F ×μ prime-strip back to the given input data [q-intertwined!] F ×μ -prime-strip —
whose output data consists of the Θ-intertwining [up to suitable indeterminacies] on
this single given input data [q-intertwined!] F ×μ -prime-strip [cf. the discussion
of the ﬁnal portion of [IUTchIII], Remark 3.9.5, (ix)].

cld

Here, we note that it is precisely this closed nature of the loop that allows one to
est
est
est
derive [cf. §3.7, (ii), (10 ), (11 ), (12 )] nontrivial consequences [cf. the discussion
and
or
of (3 ), (3 ) in (iv)] from the multiradial representation of the Θ-pilot. That is to
say, one entirely elementary/“general nonsense” observation that may be made in this
context is the following:

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

(5

145

cld

) If, by contrast, the algorithm only yielded [not a closed loop, but rather] an “open
path” — i.e., from one [“input”] type of mathematical object to some distinct/noncomparable [“output”] type of mathematical object — then one could only conclude
from the algorithm some sort of relationship between the structure of the input
object and the structure of the output object; it would not, however, be possible to
conclude anything about the intrinsic structure of either the input or the output
objects.

In this context, it is also important to note the crucial role played by the notion/deﬁnition
[cf. [IUTchII], Deﬁnition 4.9, (viii)] of an “F ×μ -prime-strip”, i.e., by the particular
sort of data that appears in an F ×μ -prime-strip. That is to say:
(6

) The data contained in an F ×μ -prime-strip is, on the one hand, suﬃciently
strong to suﬃce as input data for the construction algorithm of the multiradial
representation of the Θ-pilot, but, on the other hand, suﬃciently weak so as to
yield isomorphic collections of data [hence, in particular, to allow one to deﬁne the
Θ-link!] from the data arising from the q-pilot and Θ-pilot objects.

cld

Indeed, it is precisely this simultaneous suﬃcient strength/weakness that makes it
possible to construct a single F ×μ -prime-strip that is simultaneously equipped
with both the q-intertwining and the Θ-intertwining, regarded up to suitable indecld
terminacies [cf. (3 )]. Here, we note that, at a more concrete level:
(7

cld

cld

) The crucial suﬃcient strength/weakness properties discussed in (6 ) may be
understood as a consequence of the fact that an F ×μ -prime-strip is comprised of
both unit group and value group portions — i.e., of portions corresponding to
the “two arithmetic/combinatorial dimensions” of the discussion of §2.11 —
but comprised in such a way that these two arithmetic/combinatorial dimensions
are independent of one another, i.e., not [at least in any a priori sense!] subject
to any ring structure/intertwining such as the q- or Θ-intertwinings.

Moreover, as discussed in [IUTchIII], Remark 3.9.5, (vii), (Ob7); [IUTchIII], Remark
3.9.5, (ix), (x):
(8

cld

cld

cld

) The crucial suﬃcient strength/weakness properties discussed in (6 ), (7 ) would
fail to hold if various portions of the collection of data that constitutes an F ×μ prime-strip are omitted.

For instance [cf. the discussion of [IUTchIII], Remark 3.9.5, (vii), (Ob7); [IUTchIII],
Remark 3.9.5, (ix), (x)]:
(9

cld

) If, in the argument of §3.7, (ii), one omits the formation of the holomorphic
est
hull [cf. §3.7, (ii), (8 )], then the resulting argument amounts, in essence, to

Shinichi Mochizuki

cld

an attempt to establish a closed loop as in (3 ), (4 ), in a situation in which
F ×μ -prime-strips are replaced by some alternative type of mathematical object
cld
that does not satisfy [cf. (8 )] the crucial suﬃcient strength/weakness properties
cld
cld
discussed in (6 ), (7 ), hence does not give rise to such a closed loop or, in
cld
particular, to the nontrivial conclusions arising from a closed loop [cf. (5 )].

Historical comparisons and analogies
Numerous connections to classical theories

Many discussions of inter-universal Teichmüller theory exhibit a tendency to emphasize the novelty of many of the ideas and notions that constitute the theory. On
the other hand, another important aspect of many of these ideas and notions of interuniversal Teichmüller theory is their quite substantial relationship to numerous classical
theories. One notable consequence of this latter aspect of inter-universal Teichmüller
theory is the following:
one obstacle that often hampers the progress of mathematicians in their study of
inter-universal Teichmüller theory is a lack of familiarity with such classical
theories, many of which date back to the 1960’s or 1970’s [or even earlier]!
(i) Contrast with classical numerical computations:
sion by recalling

We begin our discus-

the famous computation in the late nineteenth century by William Shanks of
π to 707 places, which was later found, with the advent of digital computing
devices in the twentieth century, to be correct only up to 527 places!
The work that went into this sort of computation may strike some mathematicians
as being reminiscent, in a certain sense, of the sheer number of pages of the various
papers — i.e., such as [Semi], [FrdI], [FrdII], [EtTh], [GenEll], [AbsTopIII], [IUTchI],
[IUTchII], [IUTchIII], [IUTchIV] — that one must study in order to achieve a thorough
understanding of inter-universal Teichmüller theory. In fact, however, inter-universal
Teichmüller theory diﬀers quite fundamentally from the computation of Shanks in that,
as was discussed throughout the present paper, and especially in §3.8, §3.9, §3.10, §3.11,
the central ideas of inter-universal Teichmüller theory are rather compact and conceptual in nature and revolve around the issue of
comparison, by means of the notions of mono-anabelian transport and
multiradiality, of mutually alien copies of miniature models of conventional scheme theory in a fashion that exhibits remarkable similarities to the

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

147

compact and conceptual nature of the classical computation of the Gaussian
integral by means of the introduction of two “mutually alien copies” of this
integral.
One way of brieﬂy summarizing these remarkable similarities [i.e., which are discussed
in more detail in §3.8, as well as in the Introduction to the present paper] is as follows:
· the “theta portion” — i.e., the Θ-link — of the log-theta-lattice of interuniversal Teichmüller theory may be thought of as a sort of statement of the
main computational problem of inter-universal Teichmüller theory and may
be understood as corresponding to the various Gaussians that appear in the
classical computation of the Gaussian integral, while
· the “log portion” — i.e., the log-link — of the log-theta-lattice of interuniversal Teichmüller theory may be thought of as a sort of solution of the
main computational problem of inter-universal Teichmüller theory and may
be understood as corresponding to the angular portion of the representation
via polar coordinates of the [square of the] Gaussian integral.
In this context, it is of interest to recall the remarkable similarities of certain aspects of
inter-universal Teichmüller theory to the theory surrounding the functional equation
of the theta function — i.e., “Jacobi’s identity” [cf. the discussion of the ﬁnal
portion of [Pano], §3; the discussion preceding [Pano], Theorem 4.1] — which may be
thought of as a sort of function-theoretic version of the computation of the Gaussian
integral that may be obtained, roughly speaking, by interpreting this computation of
the Gaussian integral in the context of the hyperbolic geometry of the upper halfplane. As discussed in §2.4; Example 3.2.1, (iii); §3.3, (v), the analogy between certain
aspects of inter-universal Teichmüller theory and the hyperbolic geometry of the upper
half-plane has not been exposed in the present paper in much detail since it has already
been exposed in substantial detail in [BogIUT] [cf. also §3.10, (vi); §4.3, (iii), of the
present paper]. On the other hand, it is of interest to recall that classically,
Jacobi’s identity was often appreciated as a relatively compact and conceptual
way to achieve a startling improvement in computational accuracy in the
context of explicit numerical calculations of values of the theta function
[cf. the discussion preceding [Pano], Theorem 4.1].
(ii) Explicit examples of connections to classical theories: Next, we review
various explicit examples of connections between inter-universal Teichmüller theory, as
exposed thus far in the present paper, and various classical theories:
cls

(1 ) Recall from the discussion of §2.10 that the notion of a “universe”, as well as
the use of multiple universes within the discussion of a single set-up in arithmetic

148

Shinichi Mochizuki

geometry, already occurs in the mathematics of the 1960’s, i.e., in the mathematics
of Galois categories and étale topoi associated to schemes [cf. [SGA1], [SGA4]].
cls

(2 ) One important aspect of the appearance of universes in the theory of Galois
categories is the inner automorphism indeterminacies that occur when one
relates Galois categories associated to distinct schemes via a morphism between such
schemes [cf. [SGA1], Exposé V, §5, §6, §7]. These indeterminacies may be regarded
as distant ancestors, or prototypes, of the more drastic indeterminacies — cf.,
e.g., the indeterminacies (Ind1), (Ind2), (Ind3) discussed in §3.7, (i) — that occur
in inter-universal Teichmüller theory.
cls

(3 ) The theory of Tate developed in the 1960’s [cf. [Serre], Chapter III, Appendix]
concerning Hodge-Tate representations plays a fundamental role in the theory
of [Qp GC] [cf. also [AbsTopI], §3]. This theory of [Qp GC] and [AbsTopI], §3, may
be regarded as a precursor of the theory of log-shells developed in [AbsTopIII], §3,
§4, §5.
cls

(4 ) The approach of Faltings to p-adic Hodge theory via the technique of almost
étale extensions [cf. [Falt2]] plays a central role in the p-adic anabelian geometry
developed in [pGC]. Here, we recall that this theory of [pGC] constitutes the crucial
technical tool that underlies the Belyi and elliptic cuspidalizations of [AbsTopII],
§3, which, in turn, play a quite essential role in the theory of [EtTh], [AbsTopIII],
hence, in particular, in inter-universal Teichmüller theory.
cls

(5 ) The work of Tate in the 1960’s concerning theta functions on uniformizations
of Tate curves [cf. [Mumf2], §5] plays a fundamental role in [EtTh], hence also in
inter-universal Teichmüller theory.
cls

(6 ) The scheme-theoretic Hodge-Arakelov theory discussed in Example 2.14.3
and §3.9 may be regarded as a natural extension of [the portion concerning elliptic
curves of] Mumford’s theory of algebraic theta functions [cf. [Mumf1]].
cls

(7 ) The invariance of the étale site, up to isomorphism, with respect to the Frobenius morphism in positive characteristic [cf. the discussion of Example 2.6.1,
(i)] was well-known [cf. [SGA1], Exposé IX, Théorème 4.10] to the Grothendieck
school in the 1960’s. As discussed in §2.6, §2.7, this phenomenon, taken together
with the fundamental work of Uchida [cf. [Uchi]] in the 1970’s concerning the
anabelian geometry of one-dimensional function ﬁelds over a ﬁnite ﬁeld, may
be regarded as the fundamental prototype for the apparatus of mono-anabelian
transport — and, in particular, for the terms “Frobenius-like” and “étale-like”
— which plays a central role in inter-universal Teichmüller theory.

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

149

cls

(8 ) The use of abstract [commutative] monoids, e.g., in the theory of Frobenioids [cf. §3.3, (iii); §3.5], which plays a fundamental role in inter-universal
Teichmüller theory, was motivated by the use of such monoids in the theory of
log schemes [cf. [Kato1], [Kato2]], which, in turn, was motivated by the use of
such monoids in the classical theory of toric varieties developed in the 1970’s [cf.
[KKMS]].
cls

(9 ) Recall from the discussion of §3.1, (iv), (v), that the notion of multiradiality, which plays a fundamental role in inter-universal Teichmüller theory, may be
regarded as a sort of abstract combinatorial analogue of the Grothendieck deﬁnition of a connection, i.e., which plays a central role in the classical theory of the
crystalline site and dates back to the 1960’s [cf. [GrCrs]].
cls

(iii) Monoids and Galois theory: With regard to (ii), (8 ), we observe that
the important role played by abstract [commutative] monoids in inter-universal Teichmüller theory is reminiscent of the way in which such monoids are used by many
mathematicians in research related to “geometry over F1 ” [i.e., the ﬁctitious “ﬁeld
with one element”]. On the other hand, the way in which such monoids are used in
inter-universal Teichmüller theory diﬀers fundamentally from the way in which such
monoids are used in conventional research on geometry over F1 in the following respect:
·

in inter-universal Teichmüller theory, various anabelian and Kummertheoretic aspects of Galois or arithmetic fundamental groups that act on
such monoids play a fundamental role [cf. the discussion of mono-anabelian
transport in §2.7, §2.9!];
· by contrast, at least to the author’s knowledge at the time of writing, research
on geometry over F1 does not involve, in any sort of essential way, such anabelian
or Kummer-theoretic aspects of Galois or arithmetic fundamental groups acting
on monoids.

Indeed, this fundamental diﬀerence between inter-universal Teichmüller theory and conventional research on geometry over F1 might give rise to various interesting questions
and hence stimulate further research. Finally, in this context, it is perhaps of interest to
note that although there is no speciﬁc mathematical object in inter-universal Teichmüller
theory that may be said to correspond to “F1 ”, in some sense
the notion of a “ﬁeld with one element” may, at a more conceptual level, be
thought of as corresponding to the notion of coricity/cores/coric objects —
that is to say, objects that are invariant with respect to [i.e., “lie under, in a
unique way”] various operations such as links [cf. the discussion of §2.7, (iv)]
— a notion which is indeed central to inter-universal Teichmüller theory.

(iv) Techniques to avoid stacks and 2-categories: Some mathematicians appear to have a strong aversion to the use of such notions as “categories of categories”
or algebraic stacks — i.e., notions that obligate one to work with 2-categories — in
arithmetic geometry. Here, we observe that the substantive mathematical phenomenon
that obligates one, in such situations, to work with 2-categories is essentially the same
phenomenon as the phenomenon constituted by the inner automorphism indetercls
minacies discussed in (ii), (2 ). On the other hand, in inter-universal Teichmüller
theory, various “general nonsense” techniques are applied that allow one, in such situations, to work with categories [i.e., as opposed to 2-categories] and thus avoid the
cumbersome complications that arise from working with 2-categories:
· In inter-universal Teichmüller theory, one typically works with slim categories such as Galois categories that arise from slim proﬁnite groups [i.e.,
proﬁnite groups for which the centralizer of every open subgroup is trivial] or
temp-slim tempered groups [cf. [Semi], Remark 3.4.1]. The use of slim categories allows one, in eﬀect, to think of “categories of categories” as categories
[i.e., rather than 2-categories]. Indeed, in the case of slim proﬁnite groups,
this point of view is precisely the point of view that underlies the theory of
[GeoAnbd]. Generalities concerning slim categories may be found in [FrdI], Appendix.
· Another important “general nonsense” technique that is used in inter-universal
Teichmüller theory to keep track explicitly of the various types of indeterminacies that occur is the notion of a poly-morphism [cf. [IUTchI], §0], i.e., a
[possibly empty] subset of the set of arrows between two objects in a category.
Thus, there is a natural way to compose two poly-morphisms [i.e., that consist
of composable arrows] to obtain a new poly-morphism. Consideration of such
composites of poly-morphisms allows one to trace how various indeterminacies
interact with one another.
In this context, it is perhaps useful to observe that, from a more classical point of view,
cls

the inner automorphism indeterminacies discussed in (ii), (2 ), correspond to the indeterminacy in the choice of a basepoint of a [say, connected,
locally contractible] topological space.
That is to say, in anabelian geometry, working with
slim anabelioids as opposed to slim proﬁnite groups
corresponds, in essence, to working, in classical topology, with
topological spaces as opposed to pointed topological spaces.

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

151

Since many natural maps between topological spaces — i.e., such as localization maps!
— are not compatible with choices of distinguished points, it is often more natural,
in many discussions of classical topology, to make use [not only of the notion of a
“pointed topological space”, but also] of the notion of a “topological space” [i.e., that is
not equipped with the choice of a distinguished point!]. It is precisely for this reason
that in many discussions — i.e., such as those that occur in inter-universal Teichmüller
theory, for instance, in the case of localizations at various primes of an NF! [cf.
the discussion of §3.3, (iv), (v), (vi)] — involving the geometry of categories, it is much
more natural and less cumbersome to work with slim categories such as slim anabelioids
[i.e., as opposed to proﬁnite groups].
(v) Notational complexity and mutually alien copies: Some readers of the
papers [IUTchI], [IUTchII], [IUTchIII], [IUTchIV] have expressed baﬄement at the degree of complexity of the notation — i.e., by comparison to the degree of complexity
of notation that is typical in conventional papers on arithmetic geometry — that appears in these papers. This complexity of notation may be understood as a natural
consequence of
· the need to distinguish between objects that belong to distinct copies, i.e.,
distinct “miniature models”, of conventional scheme theory [cf., e.g., the labels
“n, m” for the various lattice points “•” in the log-theta-lattice, as discussed in
Fr/ét
)]; §3.3, (ii); §3.6, (iv); [IUTchIII], Deﬁnition 3.8, (iii)], together
§2.8, (2
with
· the need to distinguish between distinct objects — such as distinct cyclotomes related by nontrivial cyclotomic rigidity isomorphisms [cf., e.g., the
discussion of §2.6, §2.12, §2.13, §3.4, as well as the discussion of §4.2, (i), below] — within a single miniature model of conventional scheme theory that are
related to one another via structures that are “taken for granted” in conventional discussions of arithmetic geometry, but whose precise speciﬁcation is in
fact highly nontrivial in the context of situations where one considers multiple
miniature models of conventional scheme theory.
Put another way, this complexity of notation may be regarded as an inevitable consequence of the central role played in inter-universal Teichmüller theory by “mutually
alien copies/multiple miniature models” of conventional scheme theory and the
resulting inter-universality issues that arise [cf. the discussion of §2.7, (i), (ii); §2.10;
§3.8]. In particular, this complexity of notation is by no means superﬂuous.
§ 4.2.

Contrasting aspects of class ﬁeld theory and Kummer theory

We begin our discussion by observing that the role played by local class ﬁeld
theory [cf. the discussion of §2.11; §2.12, especially Example 2.12.1, (ii), (iii); §3.4, (v)]

152

Shinichi Mochizuki

in inter-universal Teichmüller theory is, in many respects, not particularly prominent,
while global class ﬁeld theory [for NF’s] is entirely absent from inter-universal
Teichmüller theory. This situation for class ﬁeld theory contrasts sharply with the very
central role played by Kummer theory in inter-universal Teichmüller theory [cf. the
discussion of mono-anabelian transport in §2.7, §2.9!]. In fact, this state of aﬀairs
is both natural and indeed somewhat inevitable for a number of reasons, which we
pause to survey in the discussion to follow [cf. also Fig. 4.1 below].
(i) Strong functoriality properties and the central role of cyclotomic
rigidity in Kummer theory:
Perhaps the most conspicuous diﬀerence between
class ﬁeld theory and Kummer theory is the fact that, whereas
· class ﬁeld theory may only be formulated for a certain special class of
arithmetic ﬁelds [a class which in fact includes the function ﬁelds of all the
integral schemes that appear in inter-universal Teichmüller theory], e.g., for
global ﬁelds [i.e., ﬁelds that are ﬁnitely generated over an NF or a ﬁnite ﬁeld]
or certain types of completions or localizations of such global ﬁelds,
· Kummer theory, by contrast, may be formulated, by using the Kummer
exact sequence in étale cohomology [cf., e.g., the discussion at the beginning of
[Cusp], §2], for [essentially] arbitrary types of schemes and even for abstract
monoids [cf. [FrdII], Deﬁnition 2.1, (ii)] that satisfy relatively weak conditions
and do not necessarily arise from the multiplicative structure of a commutative
ring.
A closely related diﬀerence between class ﬁeld theory and Kummer theory is the fact
that, whereas
· class ﬁeld theory only satisﬁes very limited functoriality properties, i.e.,
for ﬁnite separable ﬁeld extensions and certain types of localization operations
associated to a valuation,
· Kummer theory satisﬁes very strong functoriality properties, for [essentially] arbitrary morphisms between [essentially] arbitrary schemes or between
abstract monoids that satisfy suitable, relatively weak conditions.
These properties of Kummer theory make
Kummer theory much more suitable for use in anabelian geometry, where
it is natural to consider morphisms between arithmetic fundamental groups
that correspond to quite general morphisms between quite general schemes,
i.e., where by “quite general”, we mean by comparison to the restrictions that
arise if one attempts to apply class ﬁeld theory.
Perhaps the most fundamental example of this sort of situation [i.e., that is of interest

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

153

in anabelian geometry, but to which class ﬁeld theory cannot, at least in any immediate
way, be applied] is the situation that arises if one considers the operation of
evaluation of various types of functions on, say, a curve, at a closed point
of the curve
[cf. the discussion of (ii) below; Example 2.13.1, (iv); §2.14; §3.6; [IUTchIV], Remark
2.3.3, (vi)]. On the other hand, one highly nontrivial and quite delicate aspect of Kummer
theory that does not appear in class ﬁeld theory is the issue of
establishing cyclotomic rigidity isomorphisms between cyclotomes constructed from the various rings, monoids, Galois groups, or arithmetic fundamental groups that appear in a particular situation.
Various examples of such isomorphisms between cyclotomes may be seen in the theory
discussed in [PrfGC], [the discussion preceding] Lemma 9.1; [AbsAnab], Lemma 2.5;
[Cusp], Proposition 1.2, (ii); [FrdII], Theorem 2.4, (ii); [EtTh], Corollary 2.19, (i);
[AbsTopIII], Corollary 1.10, (ii); [AbsTopIII], Remarks 3.2.1, 3.2.2 [cf. also Example
2.12.1, (ii); Example 2.13.1, (ii); §3.4, (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), of the present paper]. All
of these examples concern “Kummer-faithful” situations [cf. [AbsTopIII], Deﬁnition
1.5], i.e., situations in which
the Kummer map on the multiplicative monoid [e.g., which arises from the
multiplicative structure of a ring] of interest is injective.
Then the cyclotomic rigidity issues that arise typically involve the cyclotomes obtained
by considering the torsion subgroups of such multiplicative monoids. This sort of situation contrasts sharply with the sort of highly “non-Kummer-faithful” situation considered in [PopBog], i.e., where one works with function ﬁelds over algebraic closures of
ﬁnite ﬁelds [cf. [PopBog], Theorem I]. That is to say, in the sort of situation considered
in [PopBog], the Kummer map vanishes on the roots of unity of the base ﬁeld, and the
Kummer theory that is applied [cf. [PopBog], §5.2] does not revolve around the issue of
establishing cyclotomic rigidity isomorphisms. In particular, in the context of this sort
of application of Kummer theory, it is natural to think of the image of the Kummer map
as a sort of projective space, i.e., a quotient by the action of multiplication by nonzero
elements of the base ﬁeld. Thus, in summary, the relationship just discussed between
“Kummer-faithful Kummer theory” and “non-Kummer-faithful Kummer theory” may
be thought of as the diﬀerence between
“ injective Kummer theory” and “ projective Kummer theory”.
(ii) The functoriality of Kummer theory with respect to evaluation of
special functions at torsion points:
As mentioned in (i), the operation of evaluation of various types of [special] functions on, say, a curve, at various types of

154

Shinichi Mochizuki

[special] points of the curve plays a fundamental role in the Kummer theory that is
applied in inter-universal Teichmüller theory [cf. the discussion of Example 2.13.1, (iv);
§2.14; §3.6; [IUTchIV], Remark 2.3.3, (vi)]. This contrasts sharply with the fact that
class ﬁeld theory may only be related to the operation of evaluation of special
functions at special points in very restricted classical cases, namely, the theory of
exponential functions in the case of Q or modular and elliptic functions
in the case of imaginary quadatic ﬁelds.
Indeed, the goal of generalizing the theory that exists in these very restricted cases to
the case of arbitrary NF’s is precisely the content of Kronecker’s Jugendtraum, or
Hilbert’s twelfth problem [cf. the discussion of [IUTchIV], Remark 2.3.3, (vii)]. Indeed,
in light of this state of aﬀairs, one is tempted to regard inter-universal Teichmüller
theory as a sort of
“realization/solution” of the “version” of Kronecker’s Jugendtraum, or
Hilbert’s twelfth problem, that one obtains if one replaces class ﬁeld theory
by Kummer theory!
(iii) The arithmetic holomorphicity of global class ﬁeld theory versus
the mono-analyticity of Kummer theory: Another important aspect of the fundamental diﬀerences between class ﬁeld theory and Kummer theory that were highlighted
in the discussion of (i) is the following:
· whereas the essential content of class ﬁeld theory reﬂects various delicate
arithmetic properties that are closed related to the arithmetic holomorphic
structure of the very restricted types of arithmetic ﬁelds to which it may be
applied,
· the very general and strongly functorial nature of Kummer theory makes
Kummer theory more suited to treating the sorts of mono-analytic structures that arise in inter-universal Teichmüller theory
[cf. the discussion of §2.7, (vii)]. Indeed, at a very naive level, this phenomenon may
be seen in the diﬀerence between the “input data” for class ﬁeld theory and Kummer
theory, i.e., very restricted arithmetic ﬁelds in the case of class ﬁeld theory versus very
general types of abstract multiplicative monoids in the case of Kummer theory [cf. the
discussion of (i)]. Another important instance of this phenomenon may be seen in the
fact that whereas
· the global reciprocity law, which plays a central role in class ﬁeld theory for NF’s, involves a nontrivial “intertwining” relationship, for any prime
number l, between the local unit determined by l at nonarchimedean valuations

fact is the fact that such local unit group/value group splittings are incompatible with

class ﬁeld theory: that is to say, in the notation of Examples 2.12.1, 2.12.2, one

— where we write μk · πkQ ⊆ k for the subgroup of elements for which some positive
power ∈ πkZ . Finally, we recall from the discussion of [IUTchIV], Remark 2.3.3, (i), (ii),
(iv), that a sort of analytic number theory version of this phenomenon may be seen in
the fact that whereas
· class ﬁeld theory is closely related — especially if one takes the point of view
of early approaches to class ﬁeld theory such as the approach attributed to Weber
— to the “coherent aggregrations” of primes that appear in discussions of
the Dirichlet density of primes, e.g., in the context of the Tchebotarev
density theorem,
· the Kummer-theoretic approach of inter-universal Teichmüller theory gives
rise to the multiradial representation discussed in §3.7, (i), which leads to
log-volume estimates [cf. the discussion of §3.7, (ii), (iv); the application of
[IUTchIV], Proposition 1.6, and [IUTchIV], Proposition 2.1, (ii), in the explicit
calculations of [IUTchIV], §1, §2] that involve, in an essential way, the Prime
Number Theorem, i.e., which, so to speak, counts primes “one by one”,
in eﬀect “deactivating the coherent aggregrations of primes” that appear in
discussions of the Dirichlet density of primes.
(iv) Global reciprocity law versus global cyclotomic rigidity: Finally, we
recall from the discussion of [“(b-4)” in] [IUTchIV], Remark 2.3.3, (i), (ii), that
· the use of cyclotomic extensions in classical approaches to verifying the
global reciprocity law in class ﬁeld theory for NF’s, i.e., to verifying that,
in eﬀect, the reciprocity map vanishes on idèles that arise from elements of the
NF under consideration,

may be thought of as corresponding to

NF’s — in fact holds [i.e., in the form of the global reciprocity law or the elementary fact

Arithmetic and geometric versions of the Mordell Conjecture

(i) Rough qualitative connections with Faltings’ proof of the Mordell
Conjecture: First, we begin by observing [cf. [IUTchIV], Remark 2.3.3, (i), (ii), for
more details] that there are numerous rough, qualitative correspondences — some of
which are closely related to the topics discussed in §4.1 and §4.2 — between various
components of the proof of the Mordell Conjecture given in [Falt1] and inter-universal
Teichmüller theory:
ﬂt

(1 ) Various well-known aspects of classical algebraic number theory related to the
“geometry of numbers”, such as the theory of heights and the Hermite-Minkowski
theorem, are applied in [Falt1]. Similar aspects of classical algebraic number theory
may be seen in the “non-interference” property [i.e., the fact that the only nonzero
elements of an NF that are integral at all nonarchimedean and archimedean valuations of the NF are the roots of unity] for copies of the number ﬁeld Fmod discussed
in §3.7, (i), as well as in the use of global realiﬁed Frobenioids associated to NF’s [i.e.,
which are essentially an abstract category-theoretic version of the classical notions
of arithmetic degrees and heights].
ﬂt

(2 ) Global class ﬁeld theory for NF’s, as well as the closely related notion of
Dirichlet density of primes, plays an important role in [Falt1]. These aspects of
[Falt1] are compared and contrasted in substantial detail in the discussion of §4.2
with the Kummer theory that plays a central role in inter-universal Teichmüller
theory.
ﬂt

(3 ) The theory of Hodge-Tate decompositions of p-adic Tate modules of abelian
varieties over MLF’s plays an important role both in [Falt1] and, as discussed in
cls
§4.1, (ii), (4 ), in inter-universal Teichmüller theory.

158

ﬂt

(4 ) The computations, applied in [Falt1], of the ramiﬁcation that occurs in the theory
surrounding ﬁnite ﬂat group schemes bear a rough resemblance to the ramiﬁcation computations involving log-shells in [AbsTopIII]; [IUTchIV], Propositions 1.1,
1.2, 1.3, 1.4.
ﬂt

(5 ) The hidden endomorphisms [cf. the discussion of [AbsTopII], Introduction] that
underlie the theory of Belyi and elliptic cuspidalizations [cf. the discussion of §3.3,
(vi); §3.4, (iii)], which play an important role in inter-universal Teichmüller theory,
as well as the theory of noncritical Belyi maps that is applied [cf. the discussion
of §3.7, (iv)], via [GenEll], §2, in [IUTchIV], §2, may be thought of as a sort of
analogue for hyperbolic curves of the theory of isogenies and Tate modules of
abelian varieties that plays a central role in [Falt1].
ﬂt

(6 ) The important role played by polarizations of abelian varieties in [Falt1] may
be compared to the quite central role played by commutators of theta groups in
the theory of rigidity properties of mono-theta environments, and hence in intergau
universal Teichmüller theory as a whole [cf. the discussion of §3.4, (iv); §3.8, (9 );
cls
§4.1, (ii), (5 )].
ﬂt

(7 ) The logarithmic geometry of toroidal compactiﬁcations, which plays an
important role in [Falt1], may be compared to the logarithmic geometry of special
ﬁbers of stable curves. The latter instance of logarithmic geometry is the starting point for the combinatorial anabelian geometry of tempered fundamental groups
developed in [Semi], which plays an important role throughout inter-universal Teichmüller theory.
(ii) Arithmetic holomorphicity versus mono-analyticity/multiradiality:
One way to summarize the discussion of (i), as well as a substantial portion of the discussion of §4.2 [cf. [IUTchIV], Remark 2.3.3, (iii)], is as follows:
inter-universal Teichmüller theory may be understood, to a substantial
extent, as a sort of hyperbolic, mono-analytic/multiradial analogue of the
the abelian, arithmetic holomorphic theory of [Falt1].
Indeed, this is precisely the point of view of the discussion of §4.2, (iii), concerning the
relationship between the essentially arithmetic holomorphic nature of global class ﬁeld
theory and the essentially mono-analytic nature of Kummer theory. If one takes the
point of view [cf. the discussion of §2.3, §2.4, §2.5, §2.6; Examples 2.14.2, 2.14.3] that
Galois or arithmetic fundamental groups should be thought of as “arithmetic tangent
bundles”, then the point of view of the present discussion may be formulated in the
following way [cf. the discussion of the ﬁnal portion of [IUTchI], §I2]: Many results in

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

159

the conventional framework of arithmetic geometry that concern Galois or arithmetic
fundamental groups may be understood as results to the eﬀect that some sort of
“H 0 (arithmetic tangent bundle)”
does indeed coincide with some sort of very small collection of scheme-theoretic —
i.e., arithmetic holomorphic — auto-/endo-morphisms. Indeed, examples of this sort
of phenomenon include
(1

) the version of the Tate Conjecture proven in [Falt1];

) various bi-anabelian results [cf. the discussion of §2.7, (v)] — i.e., fully faithfulness results in the style of various versions of the “Grothendieck Conjecture” —
in anabelian geometry;

) the “tiny” special case of the theory of [Falt1] discussed in §2.3 to the eﬀect that
“Frobenius endomorphisms of NF’s” of the desired type [i.e., that yield bounds
on heights — cf. the discussion of §2.4!] cannot exist, i.e., so long as one restricts
oneself to working within the framework of conventional scheme theory;
) the results of [Wiles] concerning Galois representations [cf. the discussion of
[IUTchI], §I5], which may be summarized as asserting, in essence, that, roughly
speaking, nontrivial deformations of Galois representations that satisfy suitable natural conditions do not exist.

All of the results just stated assert some sort of
“arithmetic holomorphic nonexistence”
[up to a very small number of exceptions], hence lie in a fundamentally diﬀerent direction
from the content of inter-universal Teichmüller theory, which, in eﬀect, concerns
the construction — or
“non-arithmetic holomorphic existence”
— of a “Frobenius endomorphism of an NF”, by working outside the framework of
conventional scheme theory, i.e., by considering suitable mono-analytic/multiradial
deformations of the arithmetic holomorphic structure, that is to say, at the level
of suggestive notation, by considering
“H 1 (arithmetic tangent bundle)”.
(iii) Comparison with the metric proofs of Parshin and Bogomolov in
the complex case: Parshin [cf. [Par]] and Bogomolov [cf. [ABKP], [Zh]] have
given proofs of geometric versions over the complex numbers of the Mordell and
Szpiro Conjectures, respectively [cf. the discussion of [IUTchIV], Remarks 2.3.4,
2.3.5]. Parshin’s proof of the geometric version of the Mordell Conjecture is discussed

Shinichi Mochizuki

160

in detail in [IUTchIV], Remark 2.3.5, while Bogomolov’s proof of the geometric version
of the Szpiro Conjecture is discussed in detail in [BogIUT] [cf. also §3.10, (vi), of the
present paper]. The relationships of these two proofs to one another, as well as to the
arithmetic theory, may be summarized as follows:
(1

PB

PB

) Both proofs revolve around the consideration of metric estimates of the displacements that arise from various natural actions of elements of the [usual topological] fundamental groups that appear [cf. the discussion at the beginning of
[IUTchIV], Remark 2.3.5].

) Both Parshin’s and Bogomolov’s proofs concern the metric geometry of the
complex spaces that appear. On the other hand, these two proofs diﬀer fundamentally in that whereas the metric geometry that appears in Parshin’s proof concerns
the holomorphic geometry that arises from the Kobayashi distance — i.e., in
eﬀect, the Schwarz lemma of elementary complex analysis — the metric geometry that appears in Bogomolov’s proof concerns the real analytic hyperbolic
geometry of the upper half-plane [cf. [IUTchIV], Remark 2.3.5, (PB1)].
PB

) The diﬀerence observed in (2 ) is interesting in that in corresponds precisely to
the diﬀerence discussed in (ii) above between the proof of the arithmetic Mordell
Conjecture [for NF’s!] in [Falt1] and inter-universal Teichmüller theory [cf.
the discussion of [IUTchIV], Remark 2.3.5, (i)].

) Parshin’s proof concerns, as one might expect from the statement of the Mordell
Conjecture, rough, qualitative estimates. This state of aﬀairs contrasts sharply,
again as one might expect from the statement of the Szpiro Conjecture, with Bogomolov’s proof, which concerns eﬀective, quantitative estimates [cf. the discussion of [IUTchIV], Remark 2.3.5, (ii)].

) The appearance of the Kobayashi distance — i.e., in essence, the Schwarz lemma
PB
of elementary complex analysis — in (2 ) is of interest in light of the point of view
discussed in §3.3, (vi); §3.7, (iv), concerning the correspondence between the use
of Belyi maps in inter-universal Teichmüller theory, i.e., in the context of Belyi
cuspidalizations or height estimates, as a sort of means of arithmetic analytic
continuation, and the classical complex theory surrounding the Schwarz lemma
[cf. the discussion of [IUTchIV], Remark 2.3.5, (iii)].
§ 4.4.

Atavistic resemblance in the development of mathematics

(i) Questioning strictly linear models of evolution: Progress in mathematics is often portrayed as a strictly linear aﬀair — a process in which old theories or

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

161

ideas are rendered essentially obsolete, and hence forgotten, as soon as the essential
content of those theories or ideas is “suitably extracted/absorbed” and formulated in a
more “modern form”, which then becomes known as the “state of the art”. The historical development of mathematics is then envisioned as a sort of towering ediﬁce that
is subject to a perpetual appending of higher and higher ﬂoors, as new “states of the
art” are discovered. On the other hand, it is often overlooked that there is in fact no
intrinsic justiﬁcation for this sort of strictly linear model of evolution. Put another way,
there is
no rigorous justiﬁcation for excluding the possibility that a particular approach to mathematical research that happens to be embraced without doubt
by a particular community of mathematicians as the path forward in this sort
of strictly linear evolutionary model may in fact be nothing more than a
dramatic “wrong turn”, i.e., a sort of unproductive march into a meaningless
cul de sac.
Indeed, Grothendieck’s original idea that anabelian geometry could shed light on
diophantine geometry [cf. the discussion at the beginning of [IUTchI], §I5] suggests
precisely this sort of skepticism concerning the “linear evolutionary model” that arose
in the 1960’s to the eﬀect that progress in arithmetic geometry was best understood as
a sort of
strictly linear march toward the goal of realizing the theory of motives, i.e.,
a sort of idealized version of the notion of a Weil cohomology.
In more recent years, another major “linear evolutionary model” that has arisen, partly
as a result of the inﬂuence of the work of Wiles [cf. [Wiles]] concerning Galois representations, asserts that progress in arithmetic geometry is best understood as a sort
of
strictly linear march toward the goal of realizing the representation-theoretic
approach to arithmetic geometry constituted by the Langlands program.
As discussed in §4.3, (ii); [IUTchI], §I5,
(aapp ) the “mono-anabelian” approach to arithmetic geometry constituted by interuniversal Teichmüller theory
diﬀers fundamentally not only from
(bapp ) the motive-/cohomology-theoretic and representation-theoretic approaches to arithmetic geometry just discussed — both of which may be characterized as “abelian”!
—

Shinichi Mochizuki

162

but also from
(capp ) the “bi-anabelian” approach involving the section conjecture that was apparently originally envisioned by Grothendieck.
Here, we recall, moreover, the point of view of the dichotomy discussed in §4.3, (ii),
concerning arithmetic holomorphicity and mono-analyticity/multiradiality, i.e.,
to the eﬀect that the diﬀerence between (aapp ), on the one hand, and both (bapp ) and
(capp ), on the other, may be understood [if, for the sake of brevity, one applies the
term “holomorphic” as an abbreviation of the term “arithmetically holomorphic”] as
the diﬀerence between
non-holomorphic existence and holomorphic nonexistence.
Another way to understand, at a very rough level, the diﬀerence between (aapp ) and
(bapp ) is as a reﬂection of the deep structural diﬀerences between
[discrete or proﬁnite] free groups and matrix groups [with discrete or proﬁnite coeﬃcients]
— cf. the discussion of [IUTchI], §I5. Finally, at a much more elementary level, we
note that the theory of Galois groups — which may be thought of as a mechanism
that allows one to pass from ﬁeld theory to group theory — plays a fundamental role in
(aapp ), (bapp ), and (capp ). From this point of view, the diﬀerence between (aapp ), on
the one hand, and (bapp ) [and, to a slightly lesser extent, (capp )], on the other, may be
understood as the diﬀerence between the “inequalities”
group theory ≫ ﬁeld theory and
ﬁeld theory ≫ group theory
— i.e., the issue of whether one regards [abstract] group theory as the central object of
interest, while ﬁeld theory [which we understand as including vector spaces over ﬁelds,
hence also representation theory] is relegated to playing only a subordinate role, or vice
versa. In this context, it is perhaps of interest to note that common central features that
appear in both inter-universal Teichmüller theory and the work of Wiles [cf. [Wiles]]
concerning Galois representations — i.e., in both (aapp ) and (bapp ) — include not only
· the central use of Galois groups [as discussed above], but also
· the central use of function theory on the upper half-plane, i.e., theta
functions in the case of inter-universal Teichmüller theory and modular forms
in the case of [Wiles].

Alien copies, Gaussians, & Inter-universal Teichmüller theory

163

On the other hand, just as in the case of Galois groups discussed above, the approaches
taken in inter-universal Teichmüller theory and [Wiles] to using function theory on the
upper half-plane — i.e., theta functions versus modular forms — diﬀer quite substantially.
(ii) Examples of atavistic development: An alternative point of view to the
sort of strictly linear evolutionary model discussed in (i) is the point of view that progress
in mathematics is best understood as a much more complicated family tree, i.e., not
as a tree that consists solely of a single trunk without branches that continues to grow
upward in a strictly linear manner, but rather as
a much more complicated organism, whose growth is sustained by an intricate
mechanism of interaction among a vast multitude of branches, some of which
sprout not from branches of relatively recent vintage, but rather from much
older, more ancestral branches of the organism that were entirely irrelevant
to the recent growth of the organism.
In the context of the present paper, it is of interest to note that this point of view, i.e.,
of
substantially diﬀerent multiple evolutionary branches that sprout from
a single common ancestral branch, is reminiscent of the notion of “mutually
alien copies”, which forms a central theme of the present paper [cf. the discussion of §2.7, (i), (ii); §3.8].
Phenomena that support this point of view of an “atavistic model of mathematical
development” may be seen in many of the examples discussed in §4.1, §4.2, and §4.3
such as the following:

) The very elementary construction of Belyi maps in the early 1980’s, or indeed
noncritical Belyi maps in [NCBelyi], could easily have been discovered in the
ﬂt

late nineteenth century [cf. §4.3, (i), (5 ); §4.3, (iii), (5 )].

atv
could easily have been discovered in the mid-1990’s [cf. also (1 )].
) The application of noncritical Belyi maps to height estimates in [GenEll], §2,
atv
could easily have been discovered in the mid-1980’s [cf. also (1 )].

) The Galois-theoretic interpretation of the Gaussian integral or Jacobi’s
identity furnished by inter-universal Teichmüller theory [cf. the discussion of §3.8;
the discussion at the end of §3.9, (iii); the discussion of the ﬁnal portion of §4.1, (i)]
could easily have been discovered much earlier than in the series of papers [IUTchI],
[IUTchII], [IUTchIII], [IUTchIV].

) The interpretation of changes of universe in the context of non-ring-theoretic
“arithmetic changes of coordinates” as in the discussion of §2.10 is entirely elemencls

tary and could easily have been discovered in the 1960’s [cf. §4.1, (ii), (1 ), (2 )].

) Scheme-theoretic Hodge-Arakelov theory, which may be regarded as a
natural extension of the [the portion concerning elliptic curves of] Mumford’s theory
of algebraic theta functions, could easily have been discovered in the late 1960’s
cls
[cf. §4.1, (ii), (6 )].
) The technique of mono-anabelian transport in the context of positive characteristic anabelian geometry, i.e., in the style of Example 2.6.1, could easily have
cls
been discovered in the 1980’s [cf. §4.1, (ii), (7 )].
) The use of monoids as in the theory of Frobenioids could easily have been
cls
discovered in the mid-1990’s [cf. §4.1, (ii), (8 )].
) The notion of multiradiality is entirely elementary and could easily have been
cls
discovered in the late 1960’s [cf. §4.1, (ii), (9 )].

) The point of view of taking a Kummer-theoretic approach to Kronecker’s
Jugendtraum, i.e., as discussed in §4.2, (ii), could easily have been discovered
much earlier than in the series of papers [IUTchI], [IUTchII], [IUTchIII], [IUTchIV].

In this context, we note that the atavistic model of mathematical development just
discussed also suggests the possibility that the theory of Frobenioids — which, as was
discussed in §3.5, was originally developed for reasons that were [related to, but, strictly
speaking] independent of inter-universal Teichmüller theory, and is, in fact, only used in
inter-universal Teichmüller theory in a relatively weak sense — may give rise, at some
distant future date, to further developments of interest that are not directly related to
inter-universal Teichmüller theory.

(iii) Escaping from the cage of deterministic models of mathematical
development: The adoption of strictly linear evolutionary models of progress
in mathematics of the sort discussed in (i) tends to be highly attractive to many mathematicians in light of the intoxicating simplicity of such strictly linear evolutionary
models, by comparison to the more complicated point of view discussed in (ii). This
intoxicating simplicity also makes such strictly linear evolutionary models — together
with strictly linear numerical evaluation devices such as the “number of papers published”, the “number of citations of published papers”, or other like-minded narrowly
deﬁned data formats that have been concocted for measuring progress in mathematics
— highly enticing to administrators who are charged with the tasks of evaluating, hiring, or promoting mathematicians. Moreover, this state of aﬀairs that regulates the
collection of individuals who are granted the license and resources necessary to actively
engage in mathematical research tends to have the eﬀect, over the long term, of stiﬂing
eﬀorts by young researchers to conduct long-term mathematical research in directions that substantially diverge from the strictly linear evolutionary models
that have been adopted, thus making it exceedingly diﬃcult for new “unanticipated”
evolutionary branches in the development of mathematics to sprout. Put another way,
inappropriately narrowly deﬁned strictly linear evolutionary models of
progress in mathematics exhibit a strong and unfortunate tendency in the profession of mathematics as it is currently practiced to become something of a
self-fulﬁlling prophecy — a “prophecy” that is often zealously rationalized
by dubious bouts of circular reasoning.
In particular, the issue of
escaping from the cage of such narrowly deﬁned deterministic models of
mathematical development stands out as an issue of crucial strategic importance from the point of view of charting a sound, sustainable course in the
future development of the ﬁeld of mathematics, i.e., a course that cherishes the
priviledge to foster genuinely novel and unforeseen evolutionary branches
in its development.
