COMMENTS ON “ABSOLUTE ANABELIAN
CUSPIDALIZATIONS OF PROPER HYPERBOLIC CURVES”

(1.) The argument given in Remark 1.18.2 [i.e., Remark 10 in the LaTeX Version],
(iii), is somewhat sketchy and a bit misleading. This argument should read as
follows:
(iii) Nevertheless, as was pointed out to the author by A. Tamagawa, even
if X, Y are not necessarily Σ-separated, it is still possible to conclude, essentially
from the arguments of [Tama], Corollary 2.10, Proposition 3.8, that:
Any Frobenius-preserving isomorphism α is quasi-point-theoretic.
Indeed, it suﬃces to give a “group-theoretic” characterization of the quasi-sections
D ⊆ ΠX which are decomposition groups of points ∈ X cl . Suppose, for simplicity,
that X is proper. Write
 →X
X
for the pro-ﬁnite étale covering corresponding to ΠX . If E ⊆ ΠX is a closed
subgroup whose image in GkX is open, then let us write kE for the ﬁnite extension
ﬁeld of kX determined by this image. If J ⊆ ΠX is an open subgroup, then let us


write XJ → X for the covering determined by J and JΔ = J ΔX . If J ⊆ ΠX
is an open subgroup such that JΔ is a characteristic subgroup of ΔX , then we
shall say that J is geometrically characteristic. Now let J ⊆ ΠX be a geometrically
characteristic open subgroup. Let us refer to as a descent-group for J any open
subgroup H ⊆ ΠX such that J ⊆ H, JΔ = HΔ . Thus, a descent-group H for
J may be thought of as an intermediate covering XJ → XH → X such that
XH × k H k J ∼
= XJ . Write
XJ (kJ )ﬂd-def ⊆ XJ (kJ )
for the subset of kJ -valued points of XJ that do not arise from points ∈ XH (kH ) for
any descent-group H = J for J — i.e., the kJ -valued points whose ﬁeld of deﬁnition
 is a closed
is kJ with respect to all possible “descended forms” of XJ . Thus, if x

⊆ ΠX for the stabilizer
point of X that maps to x ∈ XJ (kJ ), and we write D
x

x ∈ XJ (kJ )ﬂd-def

⇐⇒ D
⊆J
x

⇐⇒ Hx = J.

Now it follows immediately from this characterization of “ﬂd-def” that if J1 ⊆ J2 ⊆
ΠX are geometrically characteristic open subgroups such that kJ1 = kJ2 , then the
natural map XJ1 (kJ1 ) → XJ2 (kJ2 ) induces a map XJ1 (kJ1 )ﬂd-def → XJ2 (kJ2 )ﬂd-def .
Moreover, these considerations allow one to conclude [cf. the theory of [Tama]]
that:
A quasi-section D ⊆ ΠX is a decomposition group of a point ∈ X cl if and
and only if, for every geometrically characteristic open subgroup J ⊆ ΠX
such that D · JΔ = J, it holds that XJ (kJ )ﬂd-def = ∅.
Thus, to render this characterization of decomposition groups “group-theoretic”, it
suﬃces to give a “group-theoretic” criterion for the condition that XJ (kJ )ﬂd-def = ∅.
In [Tama], the Lefschetz trace formula is applied to compute the cardinality of
XJ (kJ ). On the other hand, if we use the notation “| − |” to denote the cardinality
of a ﬁnite set, then one veriﬁes immediately that
|XJ (kJ )| =



|XH (kH )ﬂd-def |

H

— where H ⊇ J ranges over the descent-groups for J. In particular, by applying
induction on [ΠX : J], one concludes immediately from the above formula that
|XJ (kJ )ﬂd-def | may be computed from the |XH (kH )|, as H ranges over the descentgroups for J [while |XH (kH )| may be computed, as in [Tama], from the Lefschetz
trace formula]. This yields the desired “group-theoretic” characterization of the
decomposition groups of ΠX .
(2.) In the proof of Theorem 1.16, (iii) [i.e., Theorem 1.1, (iii), in the LaTeX

→ X, ZY → Y are diagonal coverings” that appears at
version], the phrase “ZX

→ X × X, ZY → Y × Y are diagonal
the beginning of this proof should read “ZX
coverings”.
(3.) In the proof of Proposition 2.2, (i), it is asserted that one has a “natural isomor∼
∧
phism H 1 (k, Δab
X ) → J(k) (⊇ J(k))”. In fact, however, at least from an a priori
point of view, one only has a natural injection (J(k) ⊆) J(k)∧ → H 1 (k, Δab
X ).
This does not have any eﬀect on the proof, however, since the proof only requires
the use of this natural injection.
(4.) In the proof of Proposition 1.6, (i), the phrase “fact that G†k acts faithfully on
MX via the cyclotomic character” should read “fact that the image in Aut(MX ) of
the action of G†k on MX via the cyclotomic character is inﬁnite”.
