In
Deﬁnition
2.6,
(i),
“Aut|grph|
(G)”
should
be
deﬁned
as
the
subgroup
of
Aut(G)
of
automorphisms
of
G
which
induce
the
identity
automorphism
on
the
underlying
semi-graph
of
G
[cf.
the
deﬁnition
given
in
Theorem
B].
In
a
similar
vein,
in
Deﬁnition
2.6,
(iii),
“Aut|H|
(G)”
should
be
deﬁned
as
the
subgroup
of
Aut(G)
of
automorphisms
of
G
which
preserve
the
sub-semi-graph
H
of
the
underlying
semigraph
of
G
and,
moreover,
induce
the
identity
automorphism
of
H.
Since
the
correct
deﬁnitions
are
applied
throughout
the
exposition
of
the
present
paper,
these
errors
in
the
statement
of
the
deﬁnitions
have
no
substantive
eﬀect
on
the
exposition
of
the
present
paper,
except
for
the
following
two
instances
[which
themselves
do
not
have
any
substantive
eﬀect
on
the
exposition
of
the
present
paper]:
(i)
In
the
display
of
Proposition
2.7,
(ii),
“Aut|grph|
(G)”
should
be
replaced
by
“Aut|VCN(G)|
(G)”.
(ii)
In
Proposition
2.7,
(iii),
the
phrase
“In
particular”
should
be
replaced
by
the
word
“Finally”.
(2.)
In
Deﬁnition
2.8,
(vii),
the
phrase
“equivalent
class”
should
read
“equivalence
class”.
(3.)
In
the
portion
of
the
proof
of
Corollary
5.9
concerning
the
implication
“(iii-3)
=⇒
(iii-1)”,
the
subscript
“3g
−
g
+
r”
should
read
“3g
−
3
+
r”.
(4.)
In
the
proof
of
Lemma
1.3,
the
phrase
“scheme-theoretic
image
of
si
:
Bi
→
B
×k
C”
should
read
“scheme-theoretic
image
of
si
:
B
→
B
×k
C”.
(5.)
There
is
a
slight
[but
substantively
irrelevant]
inaccuracy
in
the
ﬁnal
sentence
of
the
discussion
entitled
“Curves”
in
§0.
A
corrected
version
of
this
ﬁnal
sentence
may
be
given
as
follows:
Then
we
shall
refer
to
as
the
n-th
log
conﬁguration
space
of
X
log
the
log
scheme
log
log
obtained
by
pulling
back
the
(1-)morphism
Mg,r+n
→
Mg,r
given
by
forgetting
log
the
last
n
points
via
the
classifying
(1-)morphism
T
log
→
Mg,r
of
X
log
×S
T
for
some
ﬁnite
étale
covering
T
→
S
[i.e.,
over
which
the
divisor
of
cusps
splits]

the
underlying
scheme
S
of
S
log
and
then
descending
[in
the
evident
fashion]
from
def
T
log
=
T
×S
S
log
to
S
log
.

In
the
statement
of
Theorem
C
and
Corollary
5.10,
there
are
references
to
[CmbGC],
Example
2.5,
concerning
the
deﬁnition
of
a
certain
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
of
pro-Σ
PSC-type
determined
by
a
stable
log
curve
over
a
base
[fs]
log
scheme
whose
underlying
scheme
is
the
spectrum
of
a
ﬁeld.
At
ﬁrst
glance,
this
may
appear
to
be
problematic
since
the
“stable
log
curve
over
a
base
log
scheme
whose
underlying
scheme
is
the
spectrum
of
a
ﬁeld”
that
appears
in
[CmbGC],
Example
2.5,
is
subject
to
the
condition
that
the
log
structure
of
this
base
log
scheme
be
of
a
certain
restricted
type.
In
fact,
this
is
not
a
problem,
however,
since
the
construction
of
the
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
of
pro-Σ
PSC-type
in
[CmbGC],
Example
2.5,
depends
only
on
the
pointed
stable
curve
over
a
ﬁeld
determined
by
the
given
log
stable
curve
[i.e.,
is
independent
of
the
log
structure
on
the
base
log
scheme].

There
are
some
ﬂaws
in
the
typesetting
of
the
initial
portion
of
the
statement
of
Corollary
5.10.
These
ﬂaws
did
not
exist
in
the
original
text
that
was
submitted
for
publication,
but
apparently
appeared
at
some
stage
of
the
typesetting
carried
out
by
the
publishing
company.
The
[correct]
original
version
of
this
portion
of
the
statement
of
Corollary
5.10
is
as
follows:
Corollary
5.10
(Combinatorial/group-theoretic
nature
of
schemetheoreticity).
Let
(g,
r)
be
a
pair
of
nonnegative
integers
such
that
2g
−
2
+
r
>
0;
Σ
a
nonempty
set
of
prime
numbers;
R
a
complete
discrete
valuation
ring
whose
residue
ﬁeld
k
is
separably
closed
of
characteristic
∈
Σ;
S
log
the
log
scheme
obtained
def
by
equipping
S
=
Spec
R
with
the
log
structure
determined
by
the
maximal
ideal
of
R;
x
∈
(Mg,r
)S
(k)
a
k-valued
point
of
the
moduli
stack
of
curves
(Mg,r
)S
of

the
completion
of
type
(g,
r)
over
S
[cf.
the
discussion
entitled
“Curves”
in
§0];

(8.)
At
the
beginning
of
Deﬁnitions
2.2,
2.4,
2.5,
and
2.8,
the
phrase
“at
the
beginning
the
present”
should
read
“at
the
beginning
of
the
present”.
