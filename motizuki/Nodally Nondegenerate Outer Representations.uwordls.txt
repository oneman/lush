Abstract.
Let
Σ
be
a
nonempty
set
of
prime
numbers.
In
the
present
paper,
we
continue
the
study,
initiated
in
a
previous
paper
by
the
second
author,
of
the
combinatorial
anabelian
geometry
of
semi-graphs
of
anabelioids
of
pro-Σ
PSC-type,
i.e.,
roughly
speaking,
semi-graphs
of
anabelioids
associated
to
pointed
stable
curves.
Our
ﬁrst
main
result
is
a
partial
generalization
of
one
of
the
main
combinatorial
anabelian
results
of
this
previous
paper
to
the
case
of
nodally
nondegenerate
outer
representations,
i.e.,
roughly
speaking,
a
sort
of
abstract
combinatorial
group-theoretic
generalization
of
the
scheme-theoretic
notion
of
a
family
of
pointed
stable
curves
over
the
spectrum
of
a
discrete
valuation
ring.
We
then
apply
this
result
to
obtain
a
generalization,
to
the
case
of
proper
hyperbolic
curves,
of
a
certain
injectivity
result,
obtained
in
another
paper
by
the
second
author,
concerning
outer
automorphisms
of
the
pro-Σ
fundamental
group
of
a
conﬁguration
space
associated
to
a
hyperbolic
curve,
as
the
dimension
of
this
conﬁguration
space
is
lowered
from
two
to
one.
This
injectivity
allows
one
to
generalize
a
certain
well-known
injectivity
theorem
of
Matsumoto
to
the
case
of
proper

Introduction
Let
Σ
be
a
nonempty
set
of
prime
numbers.
In
the
present
paper,
we
continue
the
study,
initiated
in
[Mzk4]
by
the
second
author,
of
the
combinatorial
anabelian
geometry
of
semi-graphs
of
anabelioids
of
pro-Σ
PSC-type,
i.e.,
roughly
speaking,
semi-graphs
of
anabelioids
associated
to
pointed
stable
curves.
In
particular,
it
was
shown
in
[Mzk4]
(cf.
[Mzk4],
Corollary
2.7,
(iii))
that
in
the
case
of
a
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
of
pro-Σ
PSC-type
that
arises
from
a
stable
log
curve
over
a
log
point
(i.e.,
the
spectrum
of
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
k
of
characteristic
p
∈
Σ
equipped
with
the
log
structure
determined
by
the
morphism
of
monoids
N

1
→
0
∈
k),
the
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
in
question
may
be
reconstructed
group-theoretically
from
the
outer
action
of
the
pro-Σ
logarithmic
fundamental
group
of
the
log
point
(which


Σ
of
Z)
is
noncanonically
isomorphic
to
the
maximal
pro-Σ
quotient
Z
on
the
pro-Σ
fundamental
group
of
the
semi-graph
of
anabelioids.
As
discussed
in
the
introduction
to
[Mzk4],
this
result
may
be
regarded
as
a
substantial
reﬁnement
of
the
pro-l
criterion
of
Takayuki
Oda
for
a
proper
hyperbolic
curve
over
a
discretely
valued
ﬁeld
to
have
good
reduction
(i.e.,
a
special
ﬁber
whose
associated
semi-graph
consists
of
a
single
vertex
and
no
edges).
We
shall
refer
to
an
outer
action
of
the
type
just
described
as
an
outer
representation
of
IPSC-type
(cf.
Deﬁnition
2.4,
(i)).
In
the
present
paper,
the
theory
of
[Mzk4]
is
generalized
to
the
case
of
nodally
nondegenerate
outer
representations,
or
outer
representations
of
NN-type,
for
short
(cf.
Deﬁnition
2.4,
(iii)).
Indeed,
our
ﬁrst
main
result
(cf.
Corollary
4.2;
Remark
4.2.1)
is
the
following
partial
generalization
of
[Mzk4],
Corollary
2.7,
(iii).
Theorem
A
(Graphicity
of
certain
group-theoretically
cuspidal
isomorphisms).
Let
Σ
be
a
nonempty
set
of
prime
numbers,
G
and
H
semi-graphs
of
anabelioids
of
pro-Σ
PSC-type
(cf.
[Mzk4],
Definition
1.1,
(i)),
ΠG
(respectively,
ΠH
)
the
pro-Σ
fundamental
group
of
∼
G
(respectively,
H),
α
:
ΠG
→
ΠH
an
isomorphism
of
proﬁnite
groups,
I
and
J
proﬁnite
groups,
ρI
:
I
→
Aut(G)
and
ρJ
:
J
→
Aut(H)
con∼
tinuous
homomorphisms,
and
β
:
I
→
J
an
isomorphism
of
proﬁnite
groups.
Suppose
that
the
following
three

are
satisﬁed:

the

respectively

commutes.
(ii)
ρI

ρJ
are
of
NN-type
(cf.
Deﬁnition
2.4,
(iii)).
(iii)
Cusp(G)
=
∅,
and
the
isomorphism
α
is
group-theoretically
cuspidal
(i.e.,
roughly
speaking,
preserves
cuspidal
inertia
groups
—
cf.
[Mzk4],
Deﬁnition
1.4,
(iv)).
Then
the
isomorphism
α
is
graphic
(i.e.,
roughly
speaking,
is
compatible
with
the
respective
semi-graph
structures
—
cf.
[Mzk4],
Deﬁnition
1.4,
(i)).
The
notion
of
an
outer
representation
of
NN-type
may
be
regarded
as
a
natural
outgrowth
of
the
philosophy
pursued
in
[Mzk4]
of
reducing
(various
aspects
of)
the
classical
pro-Σ
scheme-theoretic
arithmetic
geometry
of
stable
curves
over
a
discrete
valuation
ring
whose
residue
characteristic
is
not
contained
in
Σ
to
a
matter
of
combinatorics.
Ideally,
one
would
like
to
reduce
the
entire
proﬁnite
classical
schemetheoretic
arithmetic
geometry
of
hyperbolic
curves
over
number
ﬁelds
or
p-adic
local
ﬁelds
to
a
matter
of
combinatorics,
but
since
this
task
appears
to
be
too
formidable
at
the
time
of
writing,
we
concentrate
on
the
pro-prime-to-p
aspects
of
stable
log
curves
over
a
log
point.
On
the
other
hand,
whereas
the
outer
representations
of
IPSC-type
studied
in
[Mzk4]
literally
arise
from
(log)
scheme
theory
(i.e.,
a
stable
log
curve
over
a
log
point),
the
outer
representations
of
NN-type
studied
in
the
present
paper
are
deﬁned
in
purely
combinatorial
terms,
without
reference
to
any
scheme-theoretic
family
of
stable
log
curves.
If
one
thinks
of
a
stable
log
curve
as
a
sort
of
“rational
point”
of
the
moduli
stack
of
stable
curves,
then
this
point
of
view
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
abandonment
of
the
point
of
view
implicit
in
the
so-called
“Section
Conjecture”:
that
is
to
say,
instead
of
concerning
oneself
with
the
issue
of
precisely
which
group-theoretic
objects
arise
from
a
schemetheoretic
rational
point
(as
is
the
case
with
the
Section
Conjecture),
one
takes
the
deﬁnition
of
group-theoretic
objects
via
purely
combinatorial/group-theoretic
conditions
—
i.e.,
group-theoretic
objects
which
do
not
necessarily
arise
from
scheme
theory
—
as
the
starting
point
of
4
YUICHIRO
HOSHI
AND

MOCHIZUKI
one’s
research,
and
one
regards
as
the
goal
of
one’s
research
the
study
of
the
intrinsic
combinatorial
geometry
of
such
group-theoretic
objects
(i.e.,
without
regard
to
the
issue
of
the
extent
to
which
these
objects
arise
from
scheme
theory).
This
point
of
view
may
be
seen
throughout
the
development
of
the
theory
of
the
present
paper,
as
well
as
in
the
theory
of
[Mzk6].
On
the
other
hand,
from
a
more
concrete
point
of
view,
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
was
motivated
by
the
goal
of
generalizing
the
injectivity
portion
of
[Mzk7],
Theorem
A,
(i),
to
proper
hyperbolic
curves
in
the
case
of
the
homomorphism
induced
by
the
projection
from
twodimensional
to
one-dimensional
conﬁguration
spaces
(cf.
Theorem
B
below).
The
main
injectivity
result
that
was
proven
in
[Mzk7]
(namely,
[Mzk7],
Corollary
2.3)
was
obtained
by
applying
the
combinatorial
anabelian
result
given
in
[Mzk4],
Corollary
2.7,
(iii).
On
the
other
hand,
this
result
of
[Mzk4]
is
insuﬃcient
in
the
case
of
proper
hyperbolic
curves.
To
see
why
this
is
so,
we
begin
by
recalling
that
this
result
of
[Mzk4]
is
applied
in
[Mzk7]
(cf.
the
discussion
of
“canonical
splittings”
in
the
Introduction
to
[Mzk7])
to
study
the
degenerations
of
families
of
hyperbolic
curves
that
arise
when
(a)
a
moving
point
on
an
aﬃne
hyperbolic
curve
collides
with
a
cusp.
On
the
other
hand,
since
proper
hyperbolic
curves
have
no
cusps,
in
order
to
apply
the
techniques
for
proving
injectivity
—
involving
“canonical
splittings”
—
developed
in
[Mzk7],
it
is
necessary
to
consider
the
degenerations
of
families
of
hyperbolic
curves
that
arise
when
(b)
a
moving
point
on
a
(not
necessarily
aﬃne)
“degenerate
hyperbolic
curve”
(i.e.,
a
stable
curve)
collides
with
a
node.
Since
the
local
pro-Σ
fundamental
group
in
a
neighborhood
of
a
cusp
or
a
node
—
i.e.,
the
proﬁnite
group
that
corresponds
to
the
“fundamental
group
of
the
base
space
of
the
degenerating
family
of
hyperbolic
curves
under
consideration”
—
is
isomorphic
(in
both
the
cuspidal
and
nodal

Σ
,
one
might
at
ﬁrst
glance
cases!)
to
the
(same!)
proﬁnite
group
Z
think
that
the
situation
of
(b)
may
also
be
analyzed
via
the
results
of
[Mzk7].
Put
another
way,
both
(a)
and
(b)
involve
a
continuous
action

Σ
on
a
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
of
a
proﬁnite
group
isomorphic
to
Z
of
pro-Σ
PSC-type.
On
the
other
hand,
closer
inspection
reveals
that
there
is
a
fundamental
intrinsic
diﬀerence
between
the
situations
of
(a)
and
(b).
Indeed,
in
the
situation
of
(a),
we
apply
the
reconstruction
algorithms
developed
in
[Mzk4],
which
depend
in
an
essential
way
on
a
certain
positivity,
namely,
the
positivity
of
the
period
matrix
—
which
implies,
in
particular,
the
nondegeneracy
of
this
period
matrix
—
of
the
NODALLY
NONDEGENERATE
OUTER
REPRESENTATIONS
5
Jacobians
of
the
various
coverings
of
the
degenerating
family
of
curves
under
consideration
(cf.
the
proof
of
[Mzk4],
Proposition
2.6).
By
contrast,
one
veriﬁes
easily
that
the
symmetry
in
a
neighborhood
of
a
node
induced
by
switching
the
two
branches
of
the
node
implies
that
an
analogous
“positivity
of
the
period
matrix”
of
the
Jacobians
of
the
various
coverings
of
the
degenerating
family
of
curves
under
consideration
can
only
hold
in
the
sitation
of
(b)
if
this
“positivity”
satisﬁes
the
property
of
being
invariant
with
respect
to
multiplication
by
−1
—
which
is
absurd!
In
particular,
one
concludes
that
the
situation
of
(b)
can
never
be
“abstractly
group-theoretically
isomorphic”
to
the
situation
of
(a).
This
was
what
led
the
second
author
to
seek,
in
cooperation
with
the
ﬁrst
author,
a
(partial)
generalization
(cf.
Theorem
A)
of
[Mzk4],
Corollary
2.7,
(iii),
to
the
case
of
arbitrary
nodally
nondegenerate
outer
representations
(which
includes
the
situation
of
(b)
—
cf.
Proposition
2.14,
as
it
is
applied
in
the
proof
of
Corollary
5.3).
In
passing,
we
note
that
the
sense
in
which
Theorem
A
is
only
a
partial
generalization
(cf.
Remark
4.2.1)
of
[Mzk4],
Corollary
2.7,
(iii),
is
interesting
in
light
of
the
above
discussion
of
positivity.
Indeed,
in
the
case
of
[Mzk4],
Corollary
2.7,
(iii),
it
is
not
necessary
to
assume
that
the
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
of
pro-Σ
PSC-type
under
consideration
has
any
cusps.
On
the
other
hand,
in
the
case
of
Theorem
A,
it
is
necessary
to
assume
that
the
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
of
pro-Σ
PSC-type
under
consideration
has
at
least
one
cusp
(cf.
condition
(iii)
of
Theorem
A).
That
is
to
say,
this
state
of
aﬀairs
suggests
that
perhaps
there
is
some
sort
of
“general
principle”
underlying
these
results
—
which,
at
the
time
of
writing,
the
authors
have
yet
to
succeed
in
making
explicit
—
that
requires
the
existence
of
at
least
one
cusp,
whether
that
cusp
lie
in
the
“base
of
the
degenerating
family
of
curves
under
consideration”
(cf.
(a);
[Mzk4],
Corollary
2.7,
(iii))
or
in
the
“ﬁbers
of
this
degenerating
family”
(cf.
(b);
condition
(iii)
of
Theorem
A).
The
content
of
the
various
sections
of
the
present
paper
may
be
summarized
as
follows.
In
§1,
we
review
various
“well-known”
aspects
of
the
combinatorial
group-theoretic
geometry
of
semi-graphs
of
anabelioids
of
pro-Σ
PSC-type
—
i.e.,
without
considering
any
continuous
action
of
a
proﬁnite
group
on
the
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
under
consideration.
In
§2,
we
deﬁne
and
develop
the
basic
theory
surrounding
nodally
nondegenerate
outer
representations.
In
§3,
we
discuss
various
analogues
of
the
combinatorial
group-theoretic
geometry
reviewed
in
§1
in
the
case
of
nodally
nondegenerate
outer
representations.
In
§4,
we
observe
that
the
theory
developed
in
§1,
§2,
and
§3
is
suﬃcient
6
YUICHIRO

AND

to
prove
the
analogue
discussed
above
(i.e.,
Theorem
A)
of
the
combinatorial
anabelian
result
given
in
[Mzk4],
Corollary
2.7,
(iii),
in
the
case
of
nodally
nondegenerate
outer
representations.
In
§5,
we
apply
this
result
(i.e.,
Theorem
A)
to
generalize
(cf.
the
above
discussion)
[Mzk7],
Corollary
2.3,
to
the
case
of
not
necessarily
aﬃne
curves
(cf.
Corollary
5.3).
Finally,
in
§6,
we
discuss
various
consequences
of
the
injectivity
result
proven
in
§5.
The
ﬁrst
of
these
is
the
following
partial
generalization
(cf.
Theorem
6.1)
of
[Mzk7],
Theorem
A.
Theorem
B
(Partial
proﬁnite
combinatorial
cuspidalization).
Let
Σ

speaking,
the

of

[MzTa],
Deﬁnition

the

of
the

consisting
of
the
outomorphisms
(cf.
the
discussion
entitled

of
Πn
which
are
FC-admissible
(i.e.,
roughly
speaking,
preserve

and

—
cf.
[Mzk7],
Deﬁnition

if
X

i.e.,

1;
n0
=

if

proper,
i.e.,

=
0
(cf.
[Mzk7],
Theorem

Then
the

In

also
give
a

of

constituted

Theorem
B.
In

we
observe
that
the

of
Theorem
B
may
be
derived
from
the
Lie-theoretic
version
of
Theorem
B
that
was
obtained
(in
the
mid-1990’s!)
by
Naotake
Takao
(cf.
[Tk],
Corollary
2.7).
In
this
context,
we
note
that
the
point
of
view
of
[Tk]
diﬀers
quite
substantially
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
present
paper
and
is
motivated
by
the
goal
of
completing
the
proof
of
a
certain
conjecture
of
Takayuki
Oda
concerning
pro-l
outer
Galois
actions
associated
to
various
moduli
stacks
of
stable
curves.
Nevertheless,
this
point
of
view
of
[Tk]
is
interesting
in
light
of
the

above
to
the
eﬀect
that
the

—
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
substantial
reﬁnement
of
Oda’s

criterion.
Theorem

allows
one
to
obtain
the
following
generalization
(cf.

to

aﬃne
hyperbolic

of
a
well-known
injectivity
result
of
Matsumoto
(cf.
[Mts],
Theorems
2.1,

Theorem
C
(Kernels
of

arising
from

Let
Σ
be
a
set
of
prime
numbers
which
is
either
of

or
equal

the

of
all

Then
the

hold:

Suppose
that

(Thus,

Write
Q
for
the
algebraic

Then
the

Finally,
we
remark
that
in
[Bg],
a
result
that
corresponds
to
a
certain
special
case
of
Theorem
C,
(i),
is
asserted
(cf.
[Bg],
Theorem
2.5).
At
the
time
of
writing,
the
authors
of
the
present
paper
were
not
able
to
follow
the
proof
of
this
result
given
in
[Bg].
Nevertheless,
in
a
sequel
to
the
present
paper,
we
hope
to
discuss
in
more
detail
the
relationship
between
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
and
the
interesting
geometric
ideas
of
[Bg]
concerning
the
issue
of
“canonical
liftings”
of
cycles
on
a
Riemann
surface.

Topological

Let

that

We
shall
write
Gab
for
the
abelianization
of
a
proﬁnite
group
G,
i.e.,
the
quotient
of
G
by
the
closure
of
the
commutator
subgroup
of
G.
If
G
is
a
proﬁnite
group,
then
we
shall
denote
the
group
of
automorphisms
of
G
by
Aut(G)
and
the
group
of
inner
automorphisms
of
G
by
Inn(G)
⊆
Aut(G).
Conjugation
by
elements
of
G
determines
a
surjection
of
groups
G

Inn(G).
Thus,
we
have
a
homomorphism
of
groups
G
→
Aut(G)
whose
image
is
Inn(G)
⊆
Aut(G).
We
shall
denote
by
Out(G)
the
quotient
of
Aut(G)
by
the
normal
subgroup
Inn(G)
⊆
Aut(G)
and
refer
to
an
element
of
Out(G)
as
an
outomorphism
of
G.
In
particular,
if
G
is
center-free,
then
the
natural
homomorphism
G
→
Inn(G)
is
an
isomorphism;
thus,
we
have
an
exact
sequence
of
groups
1
−→
G
−→
Aut(G)
−→
Out(G)
−→
1
.
If,
moreover,
G
is
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated,
then
one
veriﬁes
easily
that
the
topology
of
G
admits
a
basis
of
characteristic
open
subgroups,
which
thus
induces
a
proﬁnite
topology
on
the
groups
Aut(G)
and
Out(G)
with
respect
to
which
the
above
exact
sequence
determines
an
exact
sequence
of
proﬁnite
groups.
If
ρ
:
J
→
Out(G)
is
a
continuous
homomorphism,
then
we
shall
denote
by
out
G
J
the
proﬁnite
group
obtained
by
pulling
back
the
above
exact
sequence
of
proﬁnite
groups
via
ρ.
Thus,
we
have
a
natural
exact
sequence
of
proﬁnite
groups
out
1
−→
G
−→
G

J
−→
J
−→

.
One
veriﬁes
easily
(cf.
[Hsh],
Lemma
4.10)
that
if
an
automorphism
α
out
out
of
G

J
preserves
the
subgroup
G
⊆
G

J
and
induces
the
identity
automorphisms
of
the
subquotients
G
and
J,
then
the
automorphism
out
α
is
the
identity
automorphism
of
G

J.
If
M
and
N
are
topological
modules,
then
we
shall
refer
to
a
homomorphism
of
topological
modules
φ
:
M
→
N
as
a
split
injection
if
there
exists
a
homomorphism
of
topological
modules
ψ
:
N

M
such
that
ψ
◦
φ
:
M

is
the

automorphism
of
M.
Semi-graphs:
Let
Γ
be
a
connected
semi-graph.
Then
we
shall
say
that
Γ
is
untangled
if
every
closed
edge
of
Γ
abuts
to
two
distinct
vertices.
Log

Let
X
log

log

we
denote

Some
complements
concerning

In
this

we
give
some
complements
to
the

of
semigraphs
of
anabelioids
of

developed
in
[Mzk4].
A
basic
reference
for
the

of

of

We

they
are
deﬁned
in

Also,
we
shall
refer
to
the
“PSCfundamental

simply
as
the
“fundamental

(of
the
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
of

That
is
to
say,
we
shall
refer
to
the
maximal

of
the

of
a
semi-graph
of
anabelioids

(as

Proof.
It
follows
immediately
from
the
well-known
structure
of
the
maximal
pro-Σ
quotient
of
the
fundamental
group
of
a
smooth
curve
over
an

∈

that
the

Therefore,
to
verify
Lemma
1.4,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
the
natural
homomorphism
in

is
injective.
Now
suppose
that
we
have
been
given,
for
each
v
∈
Vert(G),
a

étale
covering
Hv

Gv
of
the

which

Then
to
verify
the

from
an

of

it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
there
exists
a
connected
ﬁnite
étale
ab/edge
covering
F

G
of
G
which
arises
from
an
open

such
that,
for

any
connected
component

is
isomorphic
to

over

To

for

write
(Πv

obtained
as
the

Then
the
natural
action
of
A=v
on
A=v
and
the
tautological
action
of
Av
on
Hv
over
Gv
naturally
determine
an
action
of
A
on

over

.
Moreover,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
this
A-action
determines
a
structure
of

on
the
covering

Therefore,
by
gluing
the

by
Aequivariant

we
obtain
a

any

the

then

Proof.
The
implication

is
immediate;
thus,
to

Lemma

it
suﬃces
to
prove
the
implication
(ii)
=⇒
(i)
.
To
this
end,
let
us
assume
that
Πee1
∩
Πee2
=
{1}.
Since
ΠG
is
torsionfree
(cf.
[Mzk4],
Remark
1.1.3),
by
projecting
to
the
maximal
pro-l
quotients,
for
some
l

open

of
the
various

we
may
assume
without

that

In

since

we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
Πee1
∩
Πee2
is
open
in
Πee1

Thus,
by
replacing
G

a
connected
ﬁnite

covering
of

we
may
assume
without

that

(Group-theoretic

Let

the

The

it
suﬃces
to
prove
the
implication
(ii)

(i)
.
To
this

Now
since
edge-like

are
commensurably

(cf.

it
suﬃces
to
verify

under
the
further
assumption
that
G

the

Moreover,
since
ΠG

torsion-free
(cf.

to

we
may
assume

some

involved
—
that
Σ
=
{l}.
If
H
⊆
ΠG
is
an
open
subgroup
of
ΠG
,
then
let
us
denote
by
GH

G
the
connected
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
G
corresponding
to
the
open
subgroup
H
⊆
ΠG
(i.e.,
ΠGH

Now
we
claim
that
(∗)
for
any
normal
open
subgroup
N
⊆
ΠG
of
ΠG
,
there
exists
an
edge
of
GJ·N
at
which
the

is
totally

i.e.,
there
exists
an

such
that
the

of
natural
homomorphisms
Πe
→
ΠGJ

J

N

(J

is
surjective.
Indeed,
since
J
is
procyclic,
it
follows
that
(J

N)/N
is
cyclic;
in
particular,
we
obtain
a
natural
surjection
Πab
GJ
·N

(J

N)/N.
Moreover,
since
(J
·N)/N
is
generated
by
the
image
of
J,
it
follows
from
condition
(ii)
that
the
composite

Πe

Πab
GJ
·N

(J

e
∈Edge(GJ

is
surjective.
Therefore,
it
follows
from
the
fact
that
(J

is
a

that
there
exists
an

·N

J

N

(J

is
surjective,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
(∗).
If
N
⊆
ΠG
is
a
normal
open
subgroup,
then
let
us
denote
by
EN
⊆
Edge(GN
)
the
subset
of
Edge(GN
)
consisting
of
edges
which
are
ﬁxed
by
the
natural
action
of
J
on

.
Then
it
follows
from
(∗)
that
for
any
normal
open
subgroup
N
⊆
ΠG
,
it
holds
that
EN
is
nonempty;
thus,
since

the
projective

EN

over

Note
that
to
verify
assertion
(i),
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
H
is
a
nodal
subgroup
of
ΠG
.
Also,
we
observe
that
since
nodal
and
verticial
subgroups
of
ΠG
are
commensurably
terminal
in
ΠG
(cf.
[Mzk4],
Proposition
1.2,
(ii)),
it
follows
that
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
—
by
replacing
G
by
a
connected
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
G
—
that
v1
(G)
=


v2
(G).
Let
J
⊆
H
be
a
nontrivial
procyclic
closed
subgroup
of
H.
Then
we
claim
that
J
is
contained
in
an
edge-like
subgroup
of
ΠG
.
Indeed,
since
v1

it
follows
from
Remark

J

together
with
our
assumption
that
v1
(G)
=

v2
(G),
that
the
image

of
J
in
ΠG
is
trivial.
Thus,
by
applying
this
observation
to
the
various
connected

coverings
of

involved,
we
conclude
that

satisﬁes

(ii)
in

of

In

it

from
Lemma
1.6
that
J
is
contained
in
an
edge-like
subgroup.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
above
claim.
On
the
other
hand,
if
Πee
is
an
edge-like
subgroup
of
ΠG
such
that
J
⊆
Πee,
then
it
follows
from
Lemma
1.7
that
the
inclusion
J
⊆
Πee
implies
that
Πee
is
in
fact
nodal,
and,
moreover,
that
Πee
⊆
Πve1

=
H.
By
the
above
discussion,
it
follows
that
Πee

H=
ee∈N

(e

On
the
other
hand,
it
follows
from
Lemma

that
the
cardinality
of
the
intersection
N

N
(

is
≤
1.
Therefore,
it
follows
that
H
is
a
nodal
subgroup
of
ΠG
.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
The
equivalence

from

The

we

Nodally
nondegenerate
outer
representations
In
this
section,
we
deﬁne
the
notion
of
an
outer
representation
of
NN-type
and
verify
various
fundamental
properties
of
such
outer
representations.
If
G
is
a
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
of
pro-Σ
PSC-type
for
some
nonempty
set
of
prime
numbers
Σ,
then
since
the
fundamental
group
ΠG
of
G
is
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated,
the
proﬁnite
topology
of
ΠG
induces
(proﬁnite)
topologies
on
Aut(ΠG
)
and
Out(ΠG
)
(cf.
the
discussion
entitled
“Topological
groups”
in
§0).
Moreover,
if
we
write
Aut(G)
for
the
group
of
automorphisms
of
G,
then
by
the
discussion
preceding
[Mzk4],
Lemma
2.1,
the
natural
homomorphism
Aut(G)
−→
Out(ΠG
)
is
an
injection
with
closed
image.
(Here,
we
recall
that
an
automorphism
of
a
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
consists
of
an
automorphism
of
the
underlying
semi-graph,
together
with
a
compatible
system
of
isomorphisms
between
the
various
anabelioids
at
each
of
the
vertices
and
edges
of
the
underlying
semi-graph
which
are
compatible
with
the
various
morphisms
of
anabelioids
associated
to
the
branches
of
the
underlying
semi-graph
—
cf.
[Mzk3],
Deﬁnition
2.1;
[Mzk3],
Remark
2.4.2.)
Thus,
by
equipping
Aut(G)
with
the
topology
induced
via
this
homomorphism
by
the
topology
of
Out(ΠG
),
we
may
regard
Aut(G)
as
being
equipped
with
the
structure
of
a
proﬁnite
group.

Then

Thus,
we
have

of
VA-type
(respectively,

Proof.
First,
we
prove
assertion
(i).
It
follows
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved
that
ρI

is
of
VA-type.
Moreover,
it
follows
from
Lemma
2.5,
(i),
(iv),
that
the
various
“Ive”

are
torsion-free,
and,
moreover,
that
the
commensurability
class
of
the
subgroup
“Ive”
(respectively,

is
unaﬀected
by
passing
from

Thus,


follows
from

This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Next,
we
verify
assertion
(ii).
First,
let
us
observe
that
condition
(1)
of
Deﬁnition
2.4
for
ρI
follows
from
condition
(1)
of
Deﬁnition
2.4
for
ρI
.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
it
follows
from
Lemma
2.3,
(i)
(respectively,

(respectively,



that

Thus,

follows
from

Note
that

(i.e.,

is
not
center-free
(cf.

In

the

Let

Lemma
2.9
(An
isomorphism
of
fundamental
groups).
Suppose
that
ρI
is
of
SVA-type.
Let
ΠG[ρI
]
be
the
pro-Σ
fundamental
group
of
the
connected
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
G[ρI
].
Then
the
homomorphism
ΠG[ρI
]
→
ΠI
deﬁned
in
Remark
2.8.1,
(ii),
is
an
isomorphism.
Proof.
First,
we
observe
(cf.
Remark
2.7.1)
that
the
decomposition
subgroup
Dz
—
where
z
∈
VCN(G)
—
is
an
extension
of
I
by
Πz
.
Now
it
is
easily
veriﬁed
that
the
proﬁnite
Galois
covering
of
G[ρI
]
determined
by
the
various
quotients
Dz

I
(i.e.,
that
arise
as
composites
Dz
→
ΠI

I)
is
isomorphic
to
G;
thus,
we
obtain
an
exact
sequence
1
−→
ΠG
−→
ΠG[ρI
]
−→
I
−→
1
.
On
the
other
hand,
it
follows
from
the
construction
of
this
proﬁnite
covering
G
→
G[ρI
],
together
with
the
deﬁnition
of
the
homomorphism
ΠG[ρI
]
→
ΠI
,
that
the
composite
ΠG
→
ΠG[ρI
]
→
ΠI
coincides
with
the
natural
inclusion
ΠG
→
ΠI
.
Thus,
the
bijectivity
of
the
homomorphism
ΠG[ρI
]
→
ΠI
follows
from
the
“Five
Lemma”.
This
completes
the
proof
of

from

that,
if
we
write
π1Σ

for
the
maximal

then
we

D(ρ1
)
=

(cf.

Proof.
Assertion
(i)
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnition
of
N1
,
N2
,
and
N0
.
Thus,
to
complete
the
proof
of
Lemma
2.12,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
assertion
(ii).
To
this
end,
since
the
various
deﬁnitions
of
modules
and
homomorphisms
in
the
statement
of
Lemma
2.12
are
compatible
with
base-change,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
A
is
a
ﬁeld.
On
the
other
hand,
if
A
is
a
ﬁeld,
then
ρ1
is
either
zero
or
an
isomorphism,
so
it
follows
immediately
from
an
easy
computation
that
D(ρ1
)
and
D(det(N1

coincide.

completes

if

To
verify
assertion
(i),
it
is
immediate
that
it
suﬃces
to
show

satisﬁes
(∗triv
).
Therefore,
to
verify
assertion
(i),
that
any

v
∈
Vert(G)
it
follows
from
Lemma
3.1
that
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
the
condition
(∗triv

satisﬁes
the
property

in
the
statement
of

To

let

Let

associated

to

Then
since
the
image
of

in
ΠI
is
trivial,
and
De
is
generated
by
an
edge-like
subgroup
and
a
conjugate
ab/edge

(cf.
Remark
2.7.1),
it
follows
that
the
image

Therefore,
since
there
exists
a

This

Finally,
we

follows
from
a
similar
argument

Indeed,
it

from

together
with
the

that
the

To

we

assume
without

hence
that

Write

such
that
δ(v0

of

such

Then
we

by
F
and
use
analogous
notation
for
F
to
the
notation
introduced
in
the
statement
of
Lemma

then
the
following
conditions
are
satisﬁed:
(i)
The

F

of

and
its

(ii)
For

the

of

consists
of

For

such

and

the

(iv)
For

and
any

which
lies
over

the
morphism
Dh

is
an

ab/edge
Indeed,
since
G
is
sturdy
(cf.
condition
(b)),
it
follows
that
Πv
=
{1}
(cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii))
for
any
v
∈
Vert(G).
Thus,
the
above
claim
follows
immediately
from
the
existence
of
the
natural
split
injection

ab/(edge+iner)
Πab/edge
→

v∈Vert(G)
of
Lemma
3.2,
(ii).
In
light
of
the
above
claim,
to
complete
the
proof
of
Lemma
3.4,
we
may
replace
G[ρI
]
by
F
and
assume
in
the
following
that
(∗1
)
there
exists
an
action
of
a
group
Φ
isomorphic
to
Z/lZ
on
G[ρI
]
such
that
the
induced
action
of
Φ
on
NODALLY

REPRESENTATIONS
41
Vert(G)
ﬁxes
every
element
of
V≤1
,
and
the
induced
action
of
Φ
on
N0
is
free.
Now
let
Πv0
⊆
ΠG
be
a
verticial
subgroup
associated
to
v0
;
write
Dv0
⊆
ΠI
(respectively,
Iv0
⊆
ΠI
)
for
the
decomposition
(respectively,
inertia)
subgroup
associated
to
Πv0
.
Next,
for
e
∈
N0
,
write
ve
for
the
unique
element
of
V(e)
\
{v0
}
⊆
V=1
(cf.
assumption
(b));
let
Πe
⊆
ΠG
be
an
edge-like
subgroup
associated
to
e
such
that
Πe
⊆
Πv0
;
write
Ie
for
the
inertia
subgroup
associated
to
Πe
.
Next,
let
Ive
⊆
ΠI
be
an
inertia
subgroup
associated
to
ve
such
that
Ive
⊆
Ie
.
(Here,
we
note
that
it
is
easily
veriﬁed
that
such
an
Ive
exists.)
Thus,
Ie
=
Πe
×
Iv0
⊆
Πv0
×
Iv0
=
Dv0
(cf.
Remark
2.7.1);
in
particular,
Ive
⊆
Dv0
.
Next,
write
H
for
the
Zl
-submodule
of
the
free
Zl
-module
Dvab0
(≃
Πab
v0
×
Iv0
)
generated
by
the
images
of
the
composite
homomorphisms
Ive
→
Dv0

Dvab0
—
where
e
ranges
over
elements
of
N0
.
Then
we
claim
that
(∗2
)
H
∩
Im(Iv0
)
⊆
l
·
Im(Iv0
)
—
where
we
write
Im(Iv0
)
for
the
image
of
the
composite
Iv0
→
Dv0

Dvab0
.
Indeed,
by
the
well-known
structure
of
the
maximal
pro-l
quotient
of
the
fundamental
group
of
a
smooth
curve
over
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
of
characteristic
=
l,
there
exists
a
topological
generator
ιe
∈
Πe
of
Πe
such
that
the
inclusions
Iv0
→
Dvab0
and
Πe
→
Dvab0
determine
a
split
injection

Πe
/Zl
·
(ιe
)e∈N0
⊕
Iv0
→
Dvab0
e∈N0
into
Dvab0
.
Now
let
us
ﬁx
a
topological
generator
ιv0
∈
Iv0
and
denote
by
ιve
∈
Ive
the
topological
generator
of
Ive
obtained
as
the
image
of
ιv0
∈
∼
∼
Iv0
via
the
composite
isomorphism
Iv0
→
I
←
Ive
(cf.
Deﬁnition
2.4,
(2
)).
Then
it
follows
from
condition
(3)
of
Deﬁnition
2.4
that
the
natural
inclusions
Iv0
,
Ive
→
Ie
determine
an
open
subgroup
Iv0
×
Ive
⊆
Ie
(cf.
condition
(a));
in
particular,
there
exists
an
element
cve
∈
Zl
\{0}
such
that
ιve
=
cve
ιe
+
ιv0
.
Moreover,
since
we
have
an
action
of
Φ
on
G[ρI
]
as
in
(∗1
),
we
obtain,
for
any
e
∈
N0
and
σ
∈
Φ,
that
cve
=
cveσ
.
Therefore,
(∗2
)
follows
immediately
from
Lemma
3.3.
In
light
of
(∗2
),
there
exists
an
open
subgroup
H

⊆
Dvab0
such
that
H
⊆
H

and
Im(Iv0
)
⊆
H

.
Thus,
since
H
is
stabilized
by
the
action
of
Φ
on
Dvab0
,
it
follows
(for
instance,
by
replacing
H

by
the
intersection
of
the
translates
of
H

by
the
action
of
Φ)
that
we
may
assume
that
H

is
stabilized
by
the
action
of
Φ
on
Dvab0
.
Write
Dw0
⊆
Dv0
for
the
inverse
image
of
H

⊆
Dvab0
via
the
natural
surjection
Dv0

Dvab0
.
Then
it
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
Dw0
that
the
following
hold:
(v)
Dw0
is
open
and
normal
in
Dv0
,
and,
moreover,
Dw0
is
stabilized
by
the
induced
outer
action
of
Φ
on
Dv0
.

(vi)
For
any

we
have
Ive

in
particular,
by
(v),
for
any
e

N0
,
every
Dv0
-conjugate
of
Ive
is
contained
in
Dw0
.
(vii)
Iv0
⊆

Write
Dw0

Dv0
for
the

ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
anabelioids
corresponding
to
the
open
subgroup
Dw0
⊆

for

whose

is

and
whose
set
of
edges
is

;
and
G[ρI

for
the
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
determined
by
restricting
G[ρI
]
to
Gsub
(cf.
the
discussion
preceding
[Mzk3],
Deﬁnition
2.2).
Then
since
we
have
an
action
of
Φ
on
G[ρI
]
as
in
(∗1
),
it
follows
from
(v)
that
for
any

the

indices
of
this
covering
Dw0

at
the

determined

Thus,
it

from

(together

that

For

by

the

and
by

then
the

contains
the

Hsub

restricts
to
the

Moreover,
it

immediately
from
(x)
that

Now
by

(respectively,

this

Indeed,
if

to

To
this

assume
that

Then
since

(cf.

to

by

we

Proof.
First,
we
prove
assertion

If

then
assertion
(i)
is
immediate
from
the
various
deﬁnitions

thus,
assume
that

Since
it
is
immediate
that

to
prove

it
suﬃces
to

that

To

let

γ

Then
since
γ

it
follows
from
the
commensurable

of
Πve

(cf.
[Mzk4],
Proposition

that

in

it
follows
that

v

On
the

since
γ

it
follows
that
J

=

thus,
it
follows
from
Remark

that
v

a

This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Next,
we
prove

Since

it

from

that

from

by

This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion

Finally,
we
verify

(i).
First,
let
us
observe
that
the

(2)

follow
from

Now
since
the

from

;
(2)

(3)

—
together
with
the
mutual

observed
in
the

of

—
to
complete
the
proof
of
assertion
(i),
it
suﬃces
to
verify
the
equivalence
(3)
⇐⇒
(3

.
To
this
end,
assume
that
condition
(3)
is
satisﬁed.
Then
it
follows
from
Lemma
1.9,
(ii),
that
Dve1
∩
Dve2
∩
ΠG
=
{1}.
Now
to
verify
condition
(3
),
by
replacing
I
by
an
open
subgroup
of
I,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
ρI
is
of
SNN-type
(so
that
we
may
apply
Remark
2.7.1).
Since
condition

is
satisﬁed,
there
exists
an
element

such
that

For

let

Then
it
follows
that

Dvei
(cf.
Remark
2.7.1);
in
particular,
Ive3
⊆
Dve1
∩
Dve2
.
Thus,
condition
(3
)
is
satisﬁed.
Next,
let
us
assume
that
condition
(3
)
is
satisﬁed.
Then
since
Dve1
∩
Dve2
∩
ΠG
=
{1}
—
which
implies,
in
particular,
that
the
composite
Dve1

ΠI

I
is
injective
—
and
I
is
torsion-free
(cf.
condition
(1)
of
Deﬁnition
2.4),
it
follows
that
Dve1
∩Dve2
is
torsion-free.
Therefore,
to
verify
condition
(3),
by
replacing
I
by
an
open
subgroup
of
I,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
ρI
is
of
SNN-type.
Then
it
follows
immediately
from
assertion

together
with
Lemma

A

In
this

we
prove
two
combinatorial
anabelian
results
in
the
style
of
[Mzk4]
for

representations
of

Theorem
4.1
(Group-theoretic
verticiality
and
nodality
of
certain
isomorphisms).
Let
Σ
be
a
nonempty
set
of
prime
numbers,
G

of

an
isomorphism

proﬁnite

continuous
∼
homomorphisms,
and
β
:

an
isomorphism
of
proﬁnite
groups.
Suppose
that
the

three

commutes.
(ii)
ρI

ρJ
are
of

(iii)
α(ΠveG

.
Then
the
isomorphism
α
is
group-theoretically
verticial,
hence,
in
particular,
group-theoretically
nodal
(cf.
Proposition
1.13).
Proof.
Note
that
to
verify
Theorem
4.1,
it
is
immediate
that
by
replacing
I
by
an
open
subgroup
of
I,
we
may
assume
without

of

Now

it
is
immediate
that

thus,
we
may

Then
it
follows
from
Lemma

that

δ(w

w

Now
it
follows
from
condition

together
with
the
assumption
that

also
satisfy
(∗pres

in

that

that

and
particular,
there
exist
w

Moreover,
it
follows
from
Proposition

(iii),
together
with
conditions
(2),
(3),
that
Dwe1

in

it
follows
that
Dwe1

Thus,
again
by

that
Proposition

there
exists
an

α
(Due1

it
Dwe1
∩
Due1
=
Iwe2
.
Now
since
α
follows
that
α
(Iwe2

=
Iwe2
;
thus,
it
follows
from
Lemma
3.6,
(i),
that
α(Πwe2

In
particular,
it
follows
from
condition

that
v2
satisﬁes
the

This
completes
the
proof
of
the
above
claim.
Now
in
light
of
the
above
claim,
together
with
assumption

we
may
apply
Lemma

that

Then
the

It
is
immediate
that
to
verify
Corollary

by
replacing

an

we
may
assume
without

Now
it

from

it
suﬃces
to
show
that
the

satisﬁes

Moreover,
by
replacing
G
by
the
“G

in
the

of

it
suﬃces
to

The
following
result
is
the
main
result
of
the
present
section.
Corollary
5.3
(Injectivity
for

necessarily
aﬃne

curves).
In
the
notation
of
Deﬁnition
5.1,
the
natural
homomorphism
OutFC
(Π2

−→
OutFC
(Π1

—
where
we
write
“OutFC

for
the

of

“Out(−)”
of

(cf.
the
discussion
entitled
“Topological

§0)
of
“(−)”
deﬁned
in
[Mzk7],
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(ii)
—
induced
by
p1
is
injective.
Proof.
If
2g
−
2
+
r
=
1,
then
Corollary
5.3
follows
from
[Mzk7],
Corollary
2.3,
(ii);
thus,
to
verify
Corollary
5.3,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
2g
−
2
+
r
>
1.
Note
that
since
2g
−
2
+
r
>
1,
there
exists
a
stable
log
curve
X
log
as
in
Deﬁnition
5.1
(cf.
Remark
5.1.1).
Thus,
in
the
following,
we
assume
that
we
are
in
the
situation
described
in
Deﬁnition
5.1.
To
complete
the
proof
of
Corollary
5.3,
it
suﬃces,
by
[Mzk7],
Proposition
1.2,
(iii),
to
verify
the
assertion
that
if
an
automorphism
α
of
Π2
is
IFC-admissible
(cf.
[Mzk7],
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(ii)),
i.e.,
α
satisﬁes
the
following
three
conditions
(i),
(ii),
and
(iii),
then
the
automorphism
α
is
a
def
Ξ2
-inner
automorphism
—
where
we
write
Ξ2
=
Ker(p1
)∩Ker(p2
)
⊆
Π2
(cf.
Deﬁnition
5.1,
(iii)):
(i)
α
preserves
Ker(p1
)
(=
Π2/1
)
and
Ker(p2
).
(ii)
The
automorphism
of
ΠG/e
(≃
Π2/1
)
obtained
as
the
restriction
α|Π2/1
of
α
(cf.
(i))
is
group-theoretically
cuspidal.
(iii)
The
automorphism
of
the
quotient
(p1
,
p2
)
:
Π2

Π1
×Π1
of
Π2
induced
by
α
(cf.

is
the
identity
automorphism
of
Π1
×
Π1
.
The
rest
of
the
proof
of
Corollary
5.3
is
devoted
to
verifying
this
assertion.
It
follows
immediately
from
(i)
and
(iii)
that
we
have

where
the

and
we
write

for
the

determined
by
the
exact
sequence
p1
1

Π2/1
−→
Π2

Let
Πe

Π1
be
an
edge-like
subgroup
of
Π1
(≃
ΠG
)
associated
to
the
unique
node
e
of
G.
Then
it
follows
immediately
from
the
various
ρ
deﬁnitions
involved
that
the
composite
Πe
→
Π1

Out(Π2/1
)
factors
through
Aut(G/e

⊆
Out(Π2/1

moreover,
in
light
of
the
well-known
local
structure
of
X
log
in
a
neighborhood
of
the
node
corresponding
to
e,
it
follows
immediately
from
Proposition
2.14
that
the
resulting
outer
representation
of
pro-Σ
PSC-type
Πe
→
Aut(G/e
)
is
of
SNN-type.
In
particular,
it
follows
immediately
from
(ii),
together
with
the
fact
that
G/e
has
at
least
one
cusp
(cf.
Deﬁnition
5.1,
(vi)),
that
we
may
apply
Corollary
4.2
to
conclude
that
the
restriction
α|Π2/1
is
graphic.
Next,
let
us
ﬁx
an
edge-like
subgroup
Πe◦1
⊆
Π2/1
associated
to
◦
e1

Node(G/e

(cf.
Deﬁnition

Then
we
claim
that
there
exists
an
element
γ
∈
Ξ2
such
that
α(Πe◦1
)
=
γ
·
Πe◦1
·
γ
−1
.
Indeed,
it
follows
from
the
graphicity
of
α|Π2/1
,
together
with
(iii),
that
α|Π2/1
induces
the
identity
automorphism
of
the
underlying
semi-graph
of
G/e
(cf.
Deﬁnition
5.1,
(vii),
(viii)),
hence
that
there
exists
an
element
γ

∈
Π2/1
such
that
α(Πe◦1
)
=
γ

·
Πe◦1
·
γ
−1
;
in
particular,
again
by
(iii),
we
obtain
that
p2
(Πe◦1
)
=
p2
(γ

)
·
p2
(Πe◦1
)
·
p2
(γ
−1
).
On
the
other
hand,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved
that
p2
(Πe◦1
)
⊆
Π1
is
an
edge-like
subgroup
of
Π1
associated
to
e
∈
Node(G).
Thus,
it
follows
from
the
commensurably
terminality
of
p2
(Πe◦1
)
in
Π1
(cf.
[Mzk4],
Proposition
1.2,
(ii))
that
p2
(γ

)
∈
p2
(Πe◦1
).
In
particular,
by
multiplying
γ

by
an
appropriate
element
of
Πe◦1
,
we
obtain
an
element
γ,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
above
claim.
In
light
of
the
above
claim,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
—
by
composing
α
with
an
appropriate
Ξ2
-inner
automorphism
—
that
α(Πe◦1
)
=
Πe◦1
.
Let
Πv1◦
,
Πv0◦
⊆
Π2/1
be
the
unique
verticial
subgroups
associated,
respectively,
to
v1◦
,
v0◦
∈
Vert(G/e
)
that
contain
the
ﬁxed
edge-like
subgroup
Πe◦1
(cf.
Lemma
5.2,
(i));
Πsub
2/1
⊆
Π2/1
the
unique
Π2/1
-conjugate
of
the
image
of
the
left-hand
vertical

in
the

in
Deﬁnition

that
contains
and
is
topologically
generated
by
these
verticial
subgroups
Πv1◦
,
Πv0◦
.
(cf.
Lemma
5.2,
(ii)).
Then
in
light
of
the
graphicity
of
α,
it
follows
from
the
fact
that
α(Πe◦1
)
=
Πe◦1
,
together
with
Lemma
5.2,
(i),
(ii),
that
α(Πv1◦
)
=
Πv1◦
,
α(Πv0◦
)
=
Πv0◦
,
sub
and
α(Πsub
2/1
)
=
Π2/1
.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
Πsub
2/1
is
commensurably
terminal
in
Π2/1
.
(Indeed,
this
follows
by
applying
[Mzk4],
Proposition
1.2,
(ii)
—
where
we
think
of
the
ﬁber
of
Y2log
→
Y
log
over
e
[by,
for
instance,
deforming
the
unique
node
of
this
ﬁber]
as
a
single
irreducible
component
of
60
YUICHIRO
HOSHI
AND
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
the
ﬁber
of
X2log
→
X
log
.)
Note
that
in
light
of
this
commensurable
terminality,
the
compatibility
of
α2/1
with
the
outer
action
of
Π1
on
Π2/1
(relative
to
the
identity
automorphism
of
Π1
—
cf.
condition
(iii))
implies
the
compatibility
of
α2/1
|Πsub
with
the
outer
action
of
Πsub
on
1
2/1
sub
Πsub
2/1
(relative
to
the
identity
automorphism
of
Π1
).
Thus,
it
follows
from
the
commutative
diagram
in
Deﬁnition
5.1,
(x)
(i.e.,
by
applyout
sub
≃
Πsub
[cf.
the
discussion
ing
the
natural
isomorphism
Πsub
2
2/1

Π1
entitled
“Topological
groups”
in
§0]),
that
the
automorphism
α2/1
|Πsub
2/1
arises
from
an
automorphism
αsub
of
Πsub
2
.
Moreover,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
construction
of
αsub
(cf.
also
[Mzk4],
Proposition
1.5,
(i))
that
αsub
is
IFC-admissible
(cf.
[Mzk7],
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(ii)),
i.e.,
of
the
above
three
conditions
that
αsub
satisﬁes
the
analogue
for
Πsub
2
(i),
(ii),
and
(iii).
Therefore,
since
the
stable
log
curve
Y
log
[unlike
the
stable
log
curve
X
log
!]
necessarily
has
at
least
one
cusp,
we
may
apply
[Mzk7],
Corollary
1.12,
(i),
and
[Mzk7],
Corollary
2.3,
(i)
(cf.
also
Remark
5.3.1
below),
to
conclude
that
αsub
is
a
Ξsub
2
-inner
automorphism
def
=
Ξ2
∩
Πsub
for
the
analogue
of
“Ξ2
”
for
Πsub
—
where
we
write
Ξsub
2
2
2
.
is
a
Ξ
-inner
automorphism.
In
particular,
it
follows
that
α2/1
|Πsub
2
2/1
Now
from
the
point
of
view
of
verifying
the
assertion
that
α
is
a
Ξ2
-inner
automorphism,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
—
by
composing
with
an
appropriate
Ξ2
-inner
automorphism
—
that
α
stabilizes
and
restricts
to
the
identity
automorphism
of
Πsub
2/1
;
in
particsub
ular,
since
Πv0◦
⊆
Π2/1
,
it
follows
that
α
stabilizes
and
restricts
to
the
identity
automorphism
of
Πv0◦
.
Let
Πe◦2
⊆
Π2/1
be
an
edge-like
subgroup
associated
to
e◦2
∈
Node(G/e
)
which
is
contained
in
Πv0◦
,
and
Πv2◦
⊆
Π2/1
the
unique
(cf.
Lemma
5.2,
(i))
verticial
subgroup
associated
to
v2◦
∈
Vert(G/e
)
that
contains
Πe◦2
.
Now
since
α
stabilizes
and
restricts
to
the
identity
automorphism
of
Πv0◦
,
it
follows
that
α(Πe◦2
)
=
Πe◦2
.
Thus,
in
light
of
the
graphicity
of
α,
we
may
apply
Lemma
5.2,
(i),
to
conclude
that
α(Πv2◦
)
=
Πv2◦
.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
the
surjection
Πv2◦

p2
(Πv2◦
)
determined
by
p2
is
an
isomorphism.
Thus,
it
follows
immediately
from
condition
(iii)
that
α|Πv◦
is
the
identity
automorphism.
2
◦
Since
Π2/1
is
topologically
generated
by
Πsub
2/1
and
Πv2
(cf.
Lemma
5.2,
(iii)),
the
fact
(cf.
the
above
discussion)
that
α|Πsub
and
α|Πv◦
are
equal
2/1
2
◦
to
the
respective
identity
automorphisms
on
Πsub
2/1
and
Πv2
implies
that
α|Π2/1
is
the
identity
automorphism.
But
this
implies
that
α
is
the
identity
automorphism
(cf.
the
discussion
entitled
“Topological
groups”
in
§0).
This
completes
the
proof
of
Corollary
5.3.

Remark
5.3.1.
(i)
An
alternative
approach
to
the
portion
in
the
latter
half
of
the
proof
of
Corollary
5.3
where
one
applies
[Mzk7],
Corollary
2.3,
(i),
may
be
given,
at
least
when
(g,
r)
=
(2,
0),
as
follows.
One
veriﬁes
easily
that
3gY
−
3
+
rY
<
3g
−
3
+
r,
and,
moreover
that,
at
least
when
(g,
r)
=
(2,
0),
one
may
always
choose
X
log
(in
the
situation
of
Deﬁnition
5.1,
so
(g,
r)
=
(0,

(1,
1)
—
cf.
Remark
5.1.1)
so
that
(gY
,
rY
)
=
(1,

Thus,
by
applying
induction
on
3g
−
3

one
may
reduce
this
portion
of
the
proof
of
Corollary

to
the
case
where
3g
−
3

r
=
0,
i.e.,
the
case
of
a
tripod.
That
is
to
say,
instead
of
applying
[Mzk7],
Corollary
2.3,
(i),
it
suﬃces
to
apply
[Mzk7],
Corollary
1.12,
(i).
In
particular,
this
alternative
approach
yields
a
new
proof
—
at
least
in
the
case
of
(g,
r)
=
(1,
1)
—
of
[Mzk7],
Corollary
2.3,
(ii)
(i.e.,
via
Corollary
4.2,
as
opposed
to
[Mzk4],
Corollary

In
passing,
we
recall
that
[Mzk4],
Corollary
2.7,

is
applied
in
various
situations
throughout
[Mzk7].
In
fact,
however,
(cf.
the
discussion

it
is
not
diﬃcult
to
verify
that
the
partial

of
[Mzk4],
Corollary

constituted
by
Corollary
4.2
(cf.

(i.e.,
in
the
sense
that
the

“Cusp(G)

of
Corollary

is
always
satisﬁed)
for
verifying
the

in

Consequences
of
injectivity
In
this
section,
we
discuss
various
consequences
of
the
injectivity
result
proven
in
§5.
The
following
theorem
is
a
generalization
of
[Mzk7],
Theorem
A,
(i),
(ii).
Theorem
6.1
(Partial
proﬁnite
combinatorial
cuspidalization).
Let
Σ
be
a
set
of
prime
numbers
which
is
either
of
cardinality
one
or
equal
to
the
set
of
all
prime
numbers,
n
a
positive
integer,
X
a
hyperbolic
curve
of
type
(g,
r)
over
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
of
characteristic
∈
Σ,
Xn
the
n-th
conﬁguration
space
of
X
(cf.
[MzTa],
Deﬁnition
2.1,
(i)),
Πn
the
maximal
pro-Σ
quotient
of
the
fundamental
group
of
Xn
,
and
OutFC
(Πn
)
⊆
Out(Πn
)
the
subgroup
of
the
group
Out(Πn
)
consisting
of
the
outomorphisms
(cf.
the
discussion
entitled
“Topological
groups”
in
§0)
of
Πn
which
are
FC-admissible
def
(cf.
[Mzk7],
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(ii)).
Set
n0
=
2
if
X
is
aﬃne,
i.e.,
r
≥
1;
def
n0
=
3
if
X
is
proper,
i.e.,
r
=
0
(cf.
[Mzk7],
Theorem
A).
Then
the
62
YUICHIRO
HOSHI
AND
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
natural
homomorphism
OutFC
(Πn+1
)
−→
OutFC
(Πn
)
induced
by
the
projection
Xn+1
→
Xn
obtained
by
forgetting
the
(n+1)st
factor
is
injective
if
n
≥
1
and
bijective
if
n
≥
n0
+
1.
Moreover,
the
image
of
the
natural
inclusion
Sn
→
Out(Πn
)
—
where
we
write
Sn
for
the
symmetric
group
on
n
letters
—
obtained
by
permuting
the
various
factors
of
the
conﬁguration
space
Xn
is
contained
in
the
centralizer
ZOut(Πn
)
(OutFC
(Πn
)).
Proof.
First,
we
consider
the
surjectivity
portion
of
the
bijectivity
assertion
in
the
statement
of
Theorem
6.1.
This
surjectivity
already
follows
from
[Mzk7],
Theorem
A,
(i),
if
n
≥
4.
Thus,
we
may
assume
that
n
=
3,
which
implies
that
r
≥
1.
Now
by
[Mzk7],
Lemma
2.4;
[Mzk7],
Theorem
4.1,
(ii),
(a),
it
suﬃces
(cf.
the
proof
of
the
surjectivity
portion
of
[Mzk7],
Theorem
4.1,
(i))
to
verify
(in
the
notation
of
[Mzk7])
that
OutFC
(Π3
)cusp
=
OutFCP
(Π3
)cusp
⊆
OutFC
(Π3
)Δ+
—
where
the
ﬁrst
equality
follows
from
[Mzk7],
Theorem
A,
(ii).
But
this
follows
from
a
similar
argument
to
the
argument
applied
to
prove
[Mzk7],
Corollary
3.4,
(iii),
by
taking
the
section
“ξ
∈
X2
(X)”
of
loc.
cit.
to
be
the
section
determined
by
the
diagonal
and
applying
the
symmetry
observed
in
the
proof
of
[Mzk7],
Corollary
3.4,
(i).
Next,
we
observe
that
the
assertion
concerning
the
centralizer
follows
immediately
from
the
injectivity
assertion,
together
with
[Mzk7],
Theorem
A,
(ii);
[Mzk7],
Proposition
1.2,
(iii).
Thus,
to
complete
the
proof
of
Theorem
6.1,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
the
injectivity
assertion.
To
this
end,
write
Π†2
(respectively,
Π†1
)
for
the
kernel
of
the
surjection
Πn+1

Πn−1
(respectively,
Πn

Πn−1
)
induced
by
the
projection
obtained
by
forgetting
the
n-th
and
(n
+
1)-st
factors
(respectively,
the
def
n-th
factor).
Here,
if
n
=
1,
then
we
set
Πn−1
=
Π0
=
{1}.
Then
recall
(cf.
e.g.,
the
proof
of
[Mzk7],
Theorem
4.1,
(i))
that
we
have
natural
isomorphisms
out
out
Πn+1
≃
Π†2

Πn−1
;
Πn
≃
Π†1

Πn−1
(cf.
the
discussion
entitled
“Topological
groups”
in
§0).
Also,
we
recall
(cf.
[MzTa],
Proposition
2.4,
(i))
that
one
may
interpret
the
surjection
Π†2

Π†1
induced
by
the
surjection
Πn+1

Πn
in
question
as
the
surjection
“Π2

Π1
”
of
Deﬁnition
5.1
(i.e.,
the
surjection
that
arises
from
the
projection
pr2
:
X2log
→
X
log
)
in
the
case
of
an
“X
log
”
of
type
(g,
r
+
n
−
1).
Moreover,
one
veriﬁes
easily
that
this
interpretation
is
compatible
with
the
deﬁnition
of
the
various
“Out(−)’s”
involved.
Thus,
the
above
natural
isomorphisms
allow
one
to
reduce
the
injectivity
in
question
to
the
case
where
n
=
1
(cf.
the
discussion
entitled
“Topological
groups”
in
§0),
which
follows
immediately
from

Corollary

when

(cf.

5.1.1)
and
from
[Mzk7],
Theorem
A,
(i),
when
2g
−
2
+
r
=
1.
This
completes
the
proof
of
Theorem
6.1.

The
following
corollary
is
a
generalization
of
[Mts],
Theorem
2.2.
Note
that
[Mts],
Theorem
2.2,
corresponds
to
the
following
corollary
in
the
case
where
k
is
a
subﬁeld
of
the
ﬁeld
of
complex
numbers,
and,
moreover,
X
is
a
curve
of
positive
genus
that
has
at
least
one
cusp
deﬁned
over
k.
Corollary
6.2
(Kernels
of
outer
representations
arising
from
hyperbolic
curves).
Let
Σ
be
a
set
of
prime
numbers
which
is
either
of
cardinality
one
or
equal
to
the
set
of
all
prime
numbers,
X
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
a
perfect
ﬁeld
k
such
that
every
element
of
Σ
is
invertible
in
k,
k
an
algebraic
closure
of
k,
n
a
positive
integer,
Xn
def
the
n-th
conﬁguration
space
of
X,
Gk
=
Gal(k/k),
ΔXn
the
maximal
pro-Σ
quotient
of
the
fundamental
group
of
Xn
⊗k
k,
and
ΔP1k
\{0,1,∞}
the
maximal
pro-Σ
quotient
of
the
fundamental
group
of
P1k
\
{0,
1,
∞}.
Then
the
following
hold:
(i)
The
kernel
of
the
natural
outer
representation
ρΣ
Xn
/k
:
Gk
−→
Out(ΔXn
)
is
independent
of
n
and
contained
in
the
kernel
of
the
natural
outer
representation
ρΣ
P1
\{0,1,∞}/k
:
Gk
−→
Out(ΔP1
\{0,1,∞}
)
.
k
k
(ii)
Suppose
that
Σ
is
the
set
of
all
prime
numbers.
(Thus,
k
is
necessarily
of
characteristic
zero.)
Write
Q
for
the
algebraic
def
closure
of
Q
determined
by
k
and
GQ
=
Gal(Q/Q).
Then
the
kernel
of
the
homomorphism
ρΣ
Xn
/k
is
contained
in
the
kernel
of
the
outer
homomorphism
Gk
−→
GQ
determined
by
the
natural
inclusion
Q
→
k.
Proof.
Assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
assertion
(i),
together
with
a
well-known
injectivity
result
of
Belyi
(cf.,
e.g.,
the
discussion
surrounding
[Mts],
Theorem
2.2).
Thus,
to
complete
the
proof
of
Corollary
6.2,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
assertion
(i).
It
follows
immediately
from
Theorem
6.1
that
the
kernel
of
ρΣ
Xn
/k
is
independent
of
n.
Moreover,
if

—
it

from
the

that

Now
assertion

immediately.

The
injectivity
portion
of
assertion
(i)
(in
the
case
where
n
=
1)
of
the
following
corollary
is
a
generalization
of
[Mts],
Theorem
2.1.
Note
that
[Mts],
Theorem
2.1,
corresponds
to
the
following
corollary
in
the
case
where
X
is
aﬃne.
Corollary
6.3
(Injectivity
and
commensurable
terminality
for

representations
arising

In
the
situation
of
Corollary
6.2,
suppose
that
k
is
a
number
ﬁeld
or
p-adic
local
ﬁeld
(cf.
the
discussion
entitled
“Numbers”
in
§0),
and
that
Σ
def
is
the
set
of
all

Write
k0
=
Q

k

Then
the
following
hold:
(i)
The
outer
representation
ρn
:
Gk
−→
Out(ΔXn

is
injective.
Moreover,
the
outer
representations
ρn+1
and
ρn
are
compatible,
in
the
evident
sense,
with
the
injection
OutFC

of
Theorem
6.1.
(ii)
Every

induces
a
k0
-linear

of

In
particular,
we
have
a

ρn/0
:
Aut(Xk

−→
Out(ΔXn

NODALLY

which
factors

natural
injection

determined
by
taking
the
ﬁber

over

Moreover,
the
outer

are
compatible,
in

with
the

(iii)
The
outer

ρn/0
of

(iv)
Suppose
that
the
hyperbolic
curve
X
is
of

type
[cf.
[Mzk5],
Deﬁnition

def
def
def
Set
n0
=

(respectively,

Then
the

is
commensurably
terminal
in
OutF
(ΔXn
)
(cf.
[Mzk7],
Deﬁnition
1.1,

for
all
n
≥
n0
.
Proof.
The
injectivity
portion
of
assertion
(i)
follows
immediately
from
Corollary
6.2,
(ii),
together
with
the
injectivity
of
the
outer
homomorphism
“Gk
→
GQ
”
in
the
statement
of
Corollary
6.2,
(ii),
when
k
is
a
number
ﬁeld
or
p-adic
local
ﬁeld.
The
compatibility
portion
of
assertion
(i)
follows
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved.
Assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved.
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
In
light
of
the
compatibility
portion
of
assertion
(ii),
it
suﬃces
to
verify
assertion
(iii)
in
the
case
where
n
=
1.
Write
Aut(Xk
/k)
⊆
Aut(Xk
/k0)
for
the
subgroup
of
k-linear
automorphisms.
Then
the
injectivity
of
the
restriction
of
ρ1/0
to
Aut(Xk
/k)
is
well-known
(cf.
e.g.,
the
injectivity
portion
of
[Mzk1],
Theorem
A).
On
the
other
hand,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
by
restricting
an
automorphism
α
∈
Aut(Xk
/k0
)
to
the
base
ﬁeld
k,
one
obtains
a
natural
exact
sequence
1
−→
Aut(Xk
/k)
−→
Aut(Xk
/k0
)
−→
Gal(k/k0
)
such
that
the
image
of
the
homomorphism
Aut(Xk
/k0
)
→
Gal(k/k0
)
contains
Gk
=
Gal(k/k),
hence
is
open.
Thus,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
injectivity
portion
of
assertion
(i)
(cf.
also
the
ﬁrst
compatibility
discussed
in
assertion
(ii))
that
the
kernel
of
ρ1/0
maps
isomorphically
to
a
ﬁnite
normal
closed
subgroup
of
some
open
subgroup
of
the
slim
proﬁnite
group
Gal(k/k0
)
(cf.
e.g.,
[Mzk2],
Theorem
1.1.1,
(ii)),
hence
is
trivial,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii).
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iv).
First,
let
us
observe
that
it
follows
immediately
from
[Mzk4],
Corollary
2.7,
(i)
(cf.
also
[Mzk7],
Remark
1.1.3),
that
the
commensurator
of
the
image
of
ρn/0
in
OutF
(ΔXn
)
is
in
fact
contained
in
OutFC
(ΔXn
).
Thus,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
assertion
(iv)
with
“OutF
(−)”
replaced
by
“OutFC
(−)”.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
by
the
injectivity
portion
of
Theorem
6.1,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
assertion
(iv)
in
the
case
where
n
=
n0
.
Thus,
let
us
assume
that
n
=
n0
.
Then
in
light
of
assertion
(iii),
together
with
the
fact
66

that
ΔXn
is
slim
(cf.
the
discussion
entitled
“Topological
Groups”
in
§0;
[MzTa],
Proposition
2.2,
(ii)),
assertion
(iv)
follows
immediately
—
in
the
case
where
the
hyperbolic
curve
X
is
of
quasi-Belyi
type
(respectively,is
aﬃne;
proper)
—
from
the
“Grothendieck
Conjecture-type

given
in
[Mzk5],
Corollary
2.3
(respectively,
[Mzk6],
Corollary
1.11,

The
following
corollary
is
a
generalization
of
[MtTa],
Theorem
1.1.
Note
that

corresponds
to
the

corollary
in
the
case
where

Corollary
6.4
(Triviality
of

Let
k
be
a

zero,
k
an
algebraic
closure
of

(g,

a

such
that

,
and
ΔMg,r
the
proﬁnite

thus,
we
have
an
exact
sequence
1
−→
ΔMg,r
−→

−→

Moreover,
let
X
be
a

of
type
(g,

over

ρX/k
:
Gal(k/k)
−→
Out(π1

the

arising
from
the

over

i.e.,
the

from
the

ΠMg,r

the

sequence
1
−→
π1
(X
⊗k

−→
ΠMg,r+1
−→

Then
the
subgroup
ρ−1

(ρg,r

⊆
Gal(k/k)
of
Gal(k/k)
is
contained
in

Proof.
The

follow
from
Theorem

via
a
similar
argument
to
the

used
in

Alternatively,
one
may
derive

directly
from
Corollary

—
where
we
take

to
be
the

via
a

Corollary
6.5
(Outer

arising
from

Let
k
be
a

ﬁeld
or
p-adic

k
an
algebraic
closure
of
k,
(g,

a

such
that
2g
−

(Mg,r

the

whose

are
equipped
with

ΠMg,r
the
proﬁnite
fundamental

of
the

(Mg,r

,
ΔMg,r
the
proﬁnite
fundamental
group
of
the
stack
(Mg,r
)k
⊗k
k,
Πg,r
the
proﬁnite
completion
of
the
surface
group
of
type
(g,

(i.e.,
the
topological
fundamental
group
of
the
complement
of

in
a
compact

and
ρg,r
:
ΠMg,r
−→
Out(Πg,r

the
proﬁnite

over

Then
the
congruence
subgroup
problem
for
the
pair
(g,

may
be
resolved
in
the
aﬃrmative
(i.e.,
the
restriction
of
ρg,r
to
ΔMg,r
⊆
ΠMg,r
is
injective)
if
and
only
if
the
homomorphism
ρg,r
is
injective.
Proof.
This
follows
immediately
from
Corollary
6.4,
by
considering
a
hyperbolic
curve
“X”
of
type
(g,
r)
that
is
deﬁned
over
k
(as
in
the
statement
of
Corollary
6.4).
Alternatively,
one
may
deduce
Corollary
6.5
directly
from
Corollary
6.2,
(ii),
by
applying
Corollary
6.2,
(ii),
to
the

The

corollary
is
a
generalization
of
[Mzk7],
Corollary
5.1,

Corollary
6.6
(Discrete

Let
(g,

such
that
2g

>
0,
n

X

X

and
OutFC

⊆
Out(Πn

of

Out(Πn

(cf.
the
discussion
entitled

YUICHIRO
HOSHI
AND
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
§0)
of
Πn
deﬁned
in
the
statement
of
[Mzk7],
Corollary
5.1.
Then
the
natural
homomorphism
OutFC
(Πn+1
)
−→
OutFC
(Πn
)
induced
by
the
projection
Xn+1
→
Xn
obtained
by
forgetting
the
(n
+
1)st
factor
is
bijective.
Moreover,
the
image
of
the
natural
inclusion
Sn
→
Out(Πn
)
—
where
we
write
Sn
for
the
symmetric
group
on

—
obtained
by
permuting
the
various
factors
of
the
conﬁguration
space
Xn
is
contained
in
the
centralizer
ZOut(Πn
)
(OutFC
(Πn

Proof.
The
assertion
concerning
the
centralizer
follows
immediately
from
the
bijectivity
assertion,
together
with
[Mzk7],
Corollary
5.1,
(iv),
and
the
easily
veriﬁed
discrete
analogue
of
[Mzk7],
Proposition
1.2,
(iii)
(which
may
be
veriﬁed,
for
instance,
by
applying
[Mzk7],
Corollary
5.1,
(i);
[Mzk7],
Proposition
1.2,
(iii)).
Thus,
to
complete
the
proof
of
Theorem
6.1,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
the
bijectivity
assertion.
Moreover,
it
follows
from
[Mzk7],
Corollary
5.1,

that
to
complete
the
proof
of
the
bijectivity
assertion,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
the
injectivity

of
this
bijectivity
assertion.
On
the
other
hand,
this
injectivity
follows
from
Theorem
6.1,
together
with
[Mzk7],
Theorem
5.1,
(i).
That
is
to
say,
the
injectivity
of
the
