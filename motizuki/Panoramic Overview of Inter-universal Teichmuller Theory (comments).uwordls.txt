COMMENTS
ON
“A
PANORAMIC
OVERVIEW
OF
INTER-UNIVERSAL
TEICHMÜLLER
THEORY”
Shinichi

(1.)
In
the
discussion
towards
the
end
of
§3,
the
word
“rigidity”
is
misspelled
(i.e.,
“ridigity”:
3
instances).
(2.)
In
the
ﬁnal
sentence
of
§1,
the
phrase
“content
of
the
so-called
Szpiro
Conjecture”
should
be
replaced
by
the
phrase
“content
of
a
certain
strong
version
of
the
so-called
Szpiro
Conjecture”.
The
term
“Szpiro
Conjecture”
as
it
appears
in
the
Abstract
and
Corollary
4.2
should
also
be
understood
as
referring
to
this
strong
version.
(3.)
Throughout
the
manuscript,
the
phrases
“topological
monoid(s)”
and
“topological
module”
should
be
replaced,
respectively,
by
the
phrases
“ind-topological
monoid(s)”
and
“ind-topological
module”.
