COMMENTS ON STRONGLY TORSION-FREE GROUPS

Shinichi Mochizuki
February 2009

In the present note, we discuss certain observations made by the author in
February 2009 concerning strongly torsion-free proﬁnite groups [cf. [Mzk2], Deﬁnition 1.1, (iii)]. These observations grew out of e-mail correspondences between the
author, Akio Tamagawa, and Marco Boggi, as well as oral discussions between the
author and Akio Tamagawa.
Deﬁnition 1.

Let G be a proﬁnite group.

(i) We shall say that G is ab-torsion-free if, for every open subgroup H ⊆ G,
the abelianization H ab of H is torsion-free [cf. Remark 1.1 below].
(ii) We shall say that G is ab-faithful if, for every open subgroup H ⊆ G, and
every normal open subgroup N ⊆ H of H, the natural homomorphism H/N →
Aut(N ab ) arising from conjugation is injective.
Remark 1.1. Note that G is strongly torsion-free in the sense of [Mzk2], Deﬁnition
1.1, (iii), if and only if it is topologically ﬁnitely generated and ab-torsion-free in
the sense of Deﬁnition 1, (i).
Remark 1.2. One veriﬁes immediately that if G is ab-faithful, then it is slim.
Indeed, this is precisely the approach taken to verifying slimness in the proof of
[Mzk2], Proposition 1.4.
Remark 1.3. It follows from Examples 3, 5 below that neither of the implications
“ab-torsion-free =⇒ ab-faithful”, “ab-faithful =⇒ ab-torsion-free” holds.
Remark 1.4. It is immediate from the deﬁnitions that every open subgroup of
an ab-torsion-free (respectively, ab-faithful) proﬁnite group is itself ab-torsion-free
(respectively, ab-faithful).
Proposition 2.
(Automorphisms Induced on Abelianizations) Let G be
a topologically ﬁnitely generated proﬁnite group that satisﬁes at least one of
the following two conditions:

(i) G is ab-faithful.
(ii) G is ab-torsion-free and pro-nilpotent.

Let α : G → G be an automorphism that induces the identity automorphism on the
abelianization K ab of every characteristic open subgroup K of G. Then α is the
identity.
Proof.
that

First, we recall that since G is topologically ﬁnitely generated, it follows

(∗char ) the topology of G admits a basis consisting of characteristic open subgroups.
Next, we suppose that condition (i) is satisﬁed. By (∗char ), it suﬃces to verify
that α induces the identity automorphism on every quotient G/K, where K is a
characteristic open subgroup of G. On the other hand, since [cf. (i)] the conjugation
action of G/K on K ab induces an injection G/K → Aut(K ab ), the fact that α
induces the identity automorphism on K ab implies that α induces the identity
automorphism on G/K, as desired. This completes the proof of Proposition 2
when condition (i) is satisﬁed.
Next, we suppose that condition (ii) is satisﬁed. First, let us observe that
∼

(∗open ) α induces the identity automorphism H ab → H ab on the abelianization
of every open [i.e., not necessarily characteristic!] subgroup H of G such
that α(H) = H.
Indeed, since H ab is torsion-free [cf. (ii)], this follows by observing that [cf. (∗char )]
there exists a characteristic open subgroup K of G such that K ⊆ H. That is
to say, the induced map K ab → H ab has open image, hence induces a surjection
K ab ⊗ Q  H ab ⊗ Q [i.e., where Q denotes the rational numbers], so the fact that
α induces the identity automorphism on H ab follows from the fact that α induces
the identity automorphism on K ab .
Now since G is topologically ﬁnitely generated and pro-nilpotent [cf. (ii)], it is
well-known and easily veriﬁed that there exists an exhaustive, nilpotent sequence
of characteristic open subgroups
. . . ⊆ Gn+1 ⊆ Gn ⊆ Gn−1 ⊆ . . . ⊆ G0 = G
[i.e., [G, Gn−1 ] ⊆ Gn ]. Suppose that m is a positive integer such that α induces the
identity on G/Gm−1 , but not on G/Gm . [Note that if there does not exist such an
m, then it follows immediately that α is the identity automorphism.] Thus, there
exists an element g ∈ G such that α(g), g have distinct images in G/Gm . Then
by applying (∗open ) to the open subgroup H ⊆ G generated by g and Gm−1 , we
conclude that α induces the identity automorphism on H ab . On the other hand,

since H/Gm is abelian, this implies that α(g), g have the same image in G/Gm , a
contradiction. This completes the proof of Proposition 2. 
To understand the generalities discussed above, it is useful to consider the following examples. Here, the ﬁrst two examples [i.e., Examples 3, 4] are constructed
abstractly; the remaining examples arise from arithmetic geometry. In the following, we let Σ be a nonempty set of prime numbers; we shall refer to as a Σ-integer
any positive integer each of whose prime divisors belongs to Σ.
Example 3.

Semi-direct Products.

(i) Suppose that 2 ∈ Σ. Let M be a nontrivial torsion-free pro-Σ abelian
def

group, which we regard as equipped with an action by N = Z2 via the morphism
N  Z/2Z ∼
= {±1} [where {±1} acts on M in the evident fashion]. Then the semidef
direct product G = M  N is a nonabelian proﬁnite group, which is easily veriﬁed
to be ab-torsion-free. [Indeed, if H ⊆ G is an open subgroup,then one computes
easily that H ab = H if H ⊆ M × (2 · N ), while H ab = H/(H M ) (→ N ) if H is
not contained in M × (2 · N ).] On the other hand, one veriﬁes immediately that G
fails to be ab-faithful.
(ii) The example discussed in (i) prompts the following question:
Do there exist nonabelian pro-p [where p is a prime number] groups which
are ab-torsion-free, but not ab-faithful?
The author does not know the answer to this question at the time of writing.
Example 4.

Graphs of Anabelioids.

(i) Let G be a graph of anabelioids [cf. [Mzk1], Deﬁnition 2.1] whose underlying
graph G is ﬁnite and connected. Suppose further that the anabelioid Ge at each
edge e of G is the anabelioid associated to the trivial group, while the anabelioid
Gv at each edge v of G is the anabelioid associated to a pro-Σ surface group Gv [cf.
Example 6, (i), below]. Write G for the maximal pro-Σ quotient of the fundamental
group of G [cf. the discussion following [Mzk1], Deﬁnition 2.1]. Since G is ﬁnite, it
follows immediately that G is topologically ﬁnitely generated.
(ii) One veriﬁes immediately that the abelianization Gab ﬁts into a natural
exact sequence

particular, it follows immediately from the fact that each Gab

Example 6, (i), below], together with the well-known fact that π1 (G) is a free discrete group, that Gab is torsion-free. Since any connected ﬁnite étale covering of
G is easily veriﬁed to be a graph of anabelioids as in (i), it follows by applying
the above exact sequence to such connected ﬁnite étale coverings of G that G is
ab-torsion-free.
(iii) Next, let us observe that G is ab-faithful. Indeed, it suﬃces to verify that
if G  → G  is any cyclic ﬁnite étale covering of degree l, for l ∈ Σ, of graphs of
anabelioids as in (i), then Γ = Gal(G  /G  ) acts nontrivially on the abelianization
(G )ab of the maximal pro-Σ quotient G of the fundamental group of G  . To this
end, observe that if Γ acts freely on G [where we use primed and double-primed
notation for the objects to associated to G  , G  which are analogous to the objects
associated to G in (i)], then the nontriviality of the action of Γ on (G )ab follows
from the ab-faithfulness of a free pro-Σ group of ﬁnite rank [cf. Example 6, (i),
below]. Thus, it suﬃces to consider the case where Γ (∼
= Z/lZ) ﬁxes some vertex v 
of G lying over a vertex v  of G , hence arises as a quotient Gv   Γ [whose kernel
may be identiﬁed with Gv  ]. But then the nontriviality of the action of Γ on (G )ab
follows from the ab-faithfulness of the pro-Σ surface group Gv  [cf. Example 6, (i),
below], together with the exact sequence of (ii), applied to G  . This completes the
proof that G is ab-faithful.
(iv) Finally, let us observe that if there exist two distinct vertices v, w of
G such that the surface groups Gv , Gw arise from proper hyperbolic curves [so
H 2 (Gv , Fl ) ∼
= H 2 (Gw , Fl ) ∼
= Fl , for l ∈ Σ], then it follows that dimFl (H 2 (G, Fl )) ≥ 2
— a fact that implies that, in this case,
G fails to be isomorphic to a pro-Σ surface group.
Indeed, it follows from the deﬁnitions that we have well-deﬁned injective outer
homomorphisms ιv : Gv → G, ιw : Gw → G. Moreover, by thinking of G as
an inductive limit in the category of pro-Σ groups and considering the system of
homomorphisms Gu → Gv (respectively, Gu → Gw ), where u ranges over the
vertices of G, given by the identity when u = v (respectively, u = w) and the
trivial homomorphism when u = v (respectively, u = w), one obtains a surjection
ρv : G  Gv (respectively, ρw : G  Gw ) such that the outer homomorphism
ρv ◦ ιv (respectively, ρw ◦ ιw ) is the identity on Gv (respectively, Gw ), while the
outer homomorphism ρv ◦ ιw (respectively, ρw ◦ ιv ) is the trivial homomorphism on
Gw (respectively, Gv ). Thus, the pairs (ρv , ρw ) and (ιv , ιw ) induce morphisms
H 2 (Gv , Fl ) × H 2 (Gw , Fl ) → H 2 (G, Fl ) → H 2 (Gv , Fl ) × H 2 (Gw , Fl )
whose composite is the identity. But this implies that dimFl (H 2 (G, Fl )) ≥ 2, as
desired.
Example 5.
Local Absolute Galois Groups. Let k be a ﬁnite extension of
the ﬁeld Qp of p-adic numbers, for some prime number p. Then, as is well-known
from local class ﬁeld theory, we have a natural isomorphism

k

[where the “∧” denotes proﬁnite completion]. By applying this isomorphism to the
various open subgroups of Gk , we conclude that Gk is ab-faithful. On the other
hand, it follows from the existence of nontrivial roots of unity in k that Gk fails
to be ab-torsion-free, despite that fact that it is torsion-free [cf. [NSW], Corollary
12.1.3; [NSW], Theorem 12.1.7].
Example 6.

Surface and Conﬁguration Space Groups.

(i) Let G be a pro-Σ surface group [cf. [Mzk2], Deﬁnition 1.2]. Then, as is
well-known, G is ab-torsion-free [cf. [Mzk2], Remark 1.2.2]. Moreover, one may
verify easily that G is ab-faithful. [Indeed, since we are only concerned with the
proﬁnite group G up to isomorphism, we may assume without loss of generality
that G arises from a hyperbolic curve of genus ≥ 1. Now let N ⊆ H be subgroups
as in Deﬁnition 1, (ii). If N corresponds to a hyperbolic curve of genus ≥ 2, then
the desired injectivity follows as in the proof of [Mzk2], Proposition 1.4. If N
corresponds to a hyperbolic curve of genus 1 [so N ⊆ H corresponds to an isogeny
of elliptic curves], then the desired injectivity follows immediately from an easy
explicit computation of N ab , H ab .]
(ii) Let G be a pro-Σ conﬁguration space group [cf. [Mzk2], Deﬁnition 2.3, (i)],
where Σ is either equal to the set of all prime numbers or of cardinality one, that
arises from a conﬁguration space of dimension ≥ 2 associated to a hyperbolic curve
of genus ≥ 2. Then it follows immediately from [Mzk2], Theorem 4.7, that G fails
to be ab-torsion-free. On the other hand, it is not clear to the author at the time
of writing whether or not G is ab-faithful.
Example 7.
Absolute Galois Groups of Function Fields. [This example
was related to the author by A. Tamagawa.] Let k be an algebraically closed ﬁeld
of characteristic zero; V a normal proper variety over k; K the function ﬁeld of V ;
GK the absolute Galois group of K; G the maximal pro-Σ quotient of GK . Write
Div(V ) for the free abelian group generated by the irreducible divisors of V . Then:
(i) By assigning to an element of K × its associated divisor of zeroes and poles,
we obtain a homomorphism
K × → Div(V )
def

— which, as is well-known, determines an injection P(K) = K × /k × → Div(V ). In
particular, it follows that P(K) is a free abelian group, so the natural homomorphism
P(K) → lim
←− P(K) ⊗ Z/N Z
N

— where N ranges, in a multiplicative fashion, over the Σ-integers — is an injection.
(ii) Note that any k-linear automorphism α of K that induces the identity automorphism on P(K) is itself the identity. [Indeed, this follows from the observation
that if α(f ) = λ · f , α(f + 1) = μ · (f + 1), for λ, μ ∈ k × and f ∈ K × such that
f ∈ k × , then [as is easily veriﬁed] λ = μ = 1.]

(iii) Since k is algebraically closed, it follows immediately from Kummer theory
[applied to K] that we have a natural isomorphism
∼
P(K) ⊗ Z/N Z → Hom(G, Z/N Z(1)) (∼
= Hom(G, Z/N Z))

for any Σ-integer N . From this isomorphism [applied to the various open subgroups
of G], one concludes immediately, in light of the observations of (i) and (ii), that G
is ab-torsion-free and ab-faithful.
