(1.) In the second paragraph of §2.2, the phrase “generalize the the” should read
“generalize the”.
(2.) In the second paragraph of §2.5, the notation “EndOλ (Gλ )” should read
“EndOλ (Gλ )”.
(3.) With regard to the notation “N log ⊗Zp Qp ”, “C log ⊗Zp Qp ” in the paragraph
immediately preceding Theorem 1.4, we note the following: Let K be a ﬁnite
extension of Qp and Y a formally smooth p-adic formal scheme over the ring of
integers OK of K, i.e., such as a suitable étale localization of N or C. Then
Y ×Zp Qp (i.e., “Y ⊗Zp Qp ”) is deﬁned as the ringed space obtained by tensoring
the structure sheaf of Y over OK with K. Thus, if, for instance, Y is the formal
scheme obtained as the formal inverse limit of an inverse system of schemes
. . . → Yn → Yn+1 → . . .
— where n ranges over the positive integers, and each “→” is a nilpotent thickening
— and U is an aﬃne open of the common underlying topological space of the Yn ,
then the rings of sections of the respective structure sheaves OY , OY of Y, Y over
U are, by deﬁnition, given as follows:

OY (U ) = OY (U ) ⊗OK K.

Here, we observe that OY (U ) is the p-adic completion of a normal noetherian ring
of ﬁnite type over OK . In particular, we observe that one may consider ﬁnite étale
coverings of Y , i.e., by considering systems of ﬁnite étale algebras AU over the
various OY (U ) [that is to say, as U is allowed to vary over the aﬃne opens of
the Yn ] equipped with gluings over the intersections of the various U that appear.
Note, moreover, that by considering the normalizations of the OY (U ) in AU , we
conclude [cf. the discussion of the Remark immediately following Theorem 2.6 in
Section II of [1]] that

(NorFor) any such system {AU }U may be obtained as the W = W ×OK K for
some formal scheme W that is ﬁnite over Y, and that arises as the formal
inverse limit of an inverse system of schemes
. . . → Wn → Wn+1 → . . .
— where n ranges over the positive integers; each “→” is a nilpotent
thickening; for each aﬃne open V of the common underlying topological
space of the Wn , OW (V ) is the p-adic completion of a normal noetherian
ring of ﬁnite type over OK .
Indeed, this follows from well-known considerations in commutative algebra, which
we review as follows. Let R be a normal noetherian ring of ﬁnite type over a
complete discrete valuation ring A [i.e., such as OK in the above discussion] with
maximal ideal mA and quotient ﬁeld F such that R is separated in the mA -adic
topology. Thus, since A is excellent [cf. [2], Scholie 7.8.3, (iii)], it follows [cf. [2],
 of R is
Scholie 7.8.3, (ii)] that R is excellent, hence that the mA -adic completion R
also normal [cf. [2], Scholie 7.8.3, (v)]. Then it is well-known and easily veriﬁed [by
applying a well-known argument involving the trace map] that the normalization

of “Hensel’s Lemma” [cf., e.g., the argument of [3], Lemma 2.1] that S may be
obtained, as the notation suggests, as the mA -adic completion of a ﬁnite algebra
S over R, which may in fact be assumed to be separated in the mA -adic topology
and [by replacing S by its normalization and applying [2], Scholie 7.8.3, (v), (vi)]
normal. Let f ∈ R be an element that maps to a non-nilpotent element of R/mA ·R.

Write Rf = R[f −1 ]; Sf = S ⊗R Rf ; R


be naturally identiﬁed [since S is a ﬁnite algebra over R] with S ⊗R
 Rf , is normal.
That is to say, it follows immediately that
(NorForZar) the operation of forming normalizations [i.e., as in the above discussion]
is compatible with Zariski localization on the given formal scheme.
On the other hand, one veriﬁes immediately that (NorFor) follows formally from
(NorForZar).
