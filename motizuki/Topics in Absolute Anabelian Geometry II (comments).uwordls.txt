In
the
situation
of
Example
3.2,
(ii)
[cf.
also
Corollaries
3.3,
3.4],
we
observe
that
it
follows
immediately
from
the
k-coricity
condition
in
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(a),
that
the
open
subscheme
[i.e.,
strictly
speaking,
open
substack]
UX
⊆
X
is
completely
determined
by
the
positive
integer
N
and,
in
particular,
independent
of
the
choice
of
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
V
→
X,
V
→
D.
In
fact,
this
independence
is
implicit
in
the
statement
of
Corollary
3.4.
(2.)
In
the
statement
of
Corollary
3.4,
the
phrase
“pro-ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
X”
should
read
“pro-ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
Xi
”.
(3.)
In
the
Π-chain
discussed
in
Corollary
3.7,
(a),
it
is
to
be
understood
that
the
proﬁnite
group
“Πj
”
[cf.
the
notational
conventions
of
[AbsTopI],
Deﬁnition
4.2,
(iii)]
that
corresponds
to
the
input
datum
for
the
ﬁnal
“”
in
the
associated
type-chain
—
i.e.,
the
proﬁnite
group
that
corresponds
to
the
copy
of
the
projective
line
minus
three
points
“P
”
of
Example
3.6,
(ii)
—
is
such
that
·
the
corresponding
“geometric
fundamental
group
Δj
”
[cf.
the
notational
conventions
of
[AbsTopI],
Deﬁnition
4.2,
(iii)]
is
a
proﬁnite
free
group
of
rank
2;
·
the
set
of
conjugacy
classes
of
cuspidal
decomposition
groups
in
Δj
is
of
cardinality
3
—
i.e.,
such
that
Πj
does
indeed
correspond
to
a
copy
of
the
projective
line
minus
three
points
[cf.
[AbsTopI],
Lemma
4.1,
(iv);
[AbsTopI],
Lemma
4.5,
(v)].
Note
that,
by
[AbsTopI],
Lemma
4.5,
(v),
these
conditions
on
Πj
are
entirely
grouptheoretic.
Although
these
conditions
were
not
stated
explicitly
in
Corollary
3.7,
(a),
they
were
intended
to
be
implicit
in
the
phrase
“which
admits
an
entirely
‘group-theoretic’
description”,
together
with
the
reference
given
in
Corollary
3.7,
(a),
to
Example
3.6,
(ii).
(4.)
In
the
ﬁnal
paragaraph
of
the
proof
of
Corollary
2.10,
the
text
“totally
ramiﬁed
at
precisely
one
closed
point
but
unramiﬁed
elsewhere”
should
read
“totally
ramiﬁed
at
some
closed
point”.
