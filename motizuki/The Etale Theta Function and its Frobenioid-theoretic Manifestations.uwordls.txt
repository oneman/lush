We
develop
the
theory
of
the
tempered
anabelian
and
Frobenioid-theoretic
aspects
of
the
“étale
theta
function”,
i.e.,
the
Kummer
class
of
the
classical
formal
algebraic
theta
function
associated
to
a
Tate
curve
over
a
nonarchimedean
mixedcharacteristic
local
ﬁeld.
In
particular,
we
consider
a
certain
natural
“environment”
for
the
study
of
the
étale
theta
function,
which
we
refer
to
as
a
“mono-theta
environment”
—
essentially
a
Kummer-theoretic
version
of
the
classical
theta
trivialization
—
and
show
that
this
mono-theta
environment
satisﬁes
certain
remarkable
rigidity
properties
involving
cyclotomes,
discreteness,
and
constant
multiples,
all
in
a
fashion
that
is
compatible
with
the
topology
of
the
tempered
fundamental
group
and
the
extension
structure
of
the
associated
tempered
Frobenioid.

Introduction
The
fundamental
goal
of
the
present
paper
is
to
study
the
tempered
anabelian
[cf.
[André],
[Mzk14]]
and
Frobenioid-theoretic
[cf.
[Mzk17],
[Mzk18]]
aspects
of
the
theta
function
of
a
Tate
curve
over
a
nonarchimedean
mixed-characteristic
local
ﬁeld.
The
motivation
for
this
approach
to
the
theta
function
arises
from
the
long-term
goal
of
overcoming
various
obstacles
that
occur
when
one
attempts
to
apply
the
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
of
elliptic
curves
[cf.
[Mzk4],
[Mzk5];
[Mzk6],
[Mzk7],
[Mzk8],
[Mzk9],
[Mzk10]]
to
the
diophantine
geometry
of
elliptic
curves
over
number
ﬁelds.
That
is
to
say,
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
is
motivated

by
the
expectation
that
these
obstacles
may
be
overcome
by
translating
the
[essentially]
scheme-theoretic
formulation
of
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
into
the
language
of
the
geometry
of
categories
[e.g.,
the
“temperoids”
of
[Mzk14],
and
the
“Frobenioids”
of
[Mzk17],
[Mzk18]].
In
certain
respects,
this
situation
is
reminiscent
of
the
well-known
classical
solution
to
the
problem
of
relating
the
dimension
of
the
ﬁrst
cohomology
group
of
the
structure
sheaf
of
a
smooth
proper
variety
in
positive
characteristic
to
the
dimension
of
its
Picard
variety
—
a
problem
whose
solution
remained
elusive
until
the
foundations
of
the
algebraic
geometry
of
varieties
were
reformulated
in
the
language
of
schemes
[i.e.,
one
allows
for
the
possibility
of
nilpotent
sections
of
the
structure
sheaf].
Since
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
centers
around
the
theory
of
the
theta
function
of
an
elliptic
curve
with
bad
multiplicative
reduction
[i.e.,
a
“Tate
curve”],
it
is
natural
to
attempt
to
begin
such
a
translation
by
concentrating
on
such
theta
functions
on
Tate
curves,
as
is
done
in
the
present
paper.
Indeed,
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“canonical
analytic
continuation”
of
the
theory
of
theta
functions
on
Tate
curves
to
elliptic
curves
over
number
ﬁelds.
Here,
we
recall
that
although
classically,
the
arithmetic
theory
of
theta
functions
on
Tate
curves
is
developed
in
the
language
of
formal
schemes
in,
for
instance,
[Mumf]
[cf.
[Mumf],
pp.
306-307],
this
theory
only
addresses
the
“slope
zero
portion”
of
the
theory
—
i.e.,
the
portion
of
the
theory
that
involves
the
quotient
of
the
fundamental
group
of
the
generic
ﬁber
of
the
Tate
curve
that
extends
to
an
étale
covering
in
positive
characteristic.
From
this
point
of
view,
the
relation
of
the
theory
of
§1,
§2
of
the
present
paper
to
the
theory
of
[Mumf]
may
be
regarded
as
roughly
analogous
to
the
relation
of
the
theory
of
p-adic
uniformizations
of
hyperbolic
curves
developed
in
[Mzk1]
to
Mumford’s
theory
of
Schottky
uniformations
of
hyperbolic
curves
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk1],
Introduction,
§0.1;
cf.
also
Remark
5.10.2
of
the
present
paper].
Frequently
in
classical
scheme-theoretic
constructions,
such
as
those
that
appear
in
the
scheme-theoretic
formulation
of
Hodge-Arakelov
theory,
there
is
a
tendency
to
make
various
arbitrary
choices
in
situations
where,
a
priori,
some
sort
of
indeterminacy
exists,
without
providing
any
sort
of
intrinsic
justiﬁcation
for
these
choices.
Typical
examples
of
such
choices
involve
the
choice
of
a
particular
rational
function
or
section
of
a
line
bundle
among
various
possibilities
related
by
a
constant
multiple,
or
the
choice
of
a
natural
identiﬁcation
between
various
“cyclotomes”
[i.e.,
isomorphic
copies
of
the
module
of
N
-th
roots
of
unity,
for
N
≥
1
an
integer]
appearing
in
a
situation
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk13],
Theorem
4.3,
for
an
example
of
a
crucial
rigidity
result
in
anabelian
geometry
concerning
this
sort
of
“choice”].
One
important
theme
of
the
present
paper
is
the
study
of
phenomena
that
involve
some
sort
of
“extraordinary
rigidity”
[cf.
Grothendieck’s
famous
use
of
this
expression
in
describing
his
anabelian
philosophy].
This
sort
of
“extraordinary
rigidity”
may
be
thought
of
as
a
manifestation
of
the
very
strong
canonicality
present
in
the
theory
of
theta
functions
on
Tate
curves
that
allows
one,
in
Hodge-Arakelov
theory,
to
eﬀect
a
“canonical
analytic
continuation”
of
this
theory
on
Tate
curves
to
elliptic
curves
over
global
number
ﬁelds.
The
various
examples
of
“extraordinary
rigidity”
that
appear
in
the
theory
of
the
étale
theta
function
may
be
thought
of
as
examples
of
intrinsic,
category-theoretic
“justiﬁcations”
for
the
arbitrary
choices
that
appear
in
classical
scheme-theoretic
discussions.
Such
category-theoretic
“jus-
THE
ÉTALE
THETA
FUNCTION
3
tiﬁcations”
depend
heavily
on
the
“proper
category-theoretic
formulation”
of
various
scheme-theoretic
“venues”.
In
the
theory
of
the
present
paper,
one
central
such
category-theoretic
formulation
is
a
mathematical
structure
that
we
shall
refer
to
as
a
mono-theta
environment
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.13,
(ii)].
Roughly
speaking:
The
mono-theta
environment
is
essentially
a
Kummer-theoretic
version
—
i.e.,
a
Galois-theoretic
version
obtained
by
extracting
various
N
-th
roots
[for
N
≥
1
an
integer]
—
of
the
theta
trivialization
that
appears
in
classical
formal
scheme-theoretic
discussions
of
the
theta
function
on
a
Tate
curve.
A
mono-theta
environment
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
common
core
for,
or
bridge
between,
the
[tempered]
étale-
and
Frobenioid-theoretic
approaches
to
the
étale
theta
function
[cf.
Remarks
2.18.2,
5.10.1,
5.10.2,
5.10.3].
We
are
now
ready
to
discuss
the
main
results
of
the
present
paper.
First,
we
remark
that
the
reader
who
is
only
interested
in
the
deﬁnition
and
basic
tempered
anabelian
properties
of
the
étale
theta
function
may
restrict
his/her
attention
to
the
theory
of
§1,
the
main
result
of
which
is
a
tempered
anabelian
construction
of
the
étale
theta
function
[cf.
Theorems
1.6,
1.10].
On
the
other
hand,
the
main
results
of
the
bulk
of
the
paper,
which
concern
more
subtle
rigidity
properties
of
the
étale
theta
function
involving
associated
mono-theta
environments
and
tempered
Frobenioids,
may
be
summarized
as
follows:
A
mono-theta
environment
is
a
category/group-theoretic
invariant
of
the
tempered
étale
fundamental
group
[cf.
Corollary
2.18]
associated
to
[certain
coverings
of]
a
punctured
elliptic
curve
[satisfying
certain
properties]
over
a
nonarchimedean
mixed-characteristic
local
ﬁeld,
on
the
one
hand,
and
of
a
certain
tempered
Frobenioid
[cf.
Theorem
5.10,
(iii)]
associated
to
such
a
curve,
on
the
other.
Moreover,
a
mono-theta
environment
satisﬁes
the
following
rigidity
properties:
(a)
cyclotomic
rigidity
[cf.
Corollary
2.19,
(i);
Remark
2.19.4];
(b)
discrete
rigidity
[cf.
Corollary
2.19,
(ii);
Remarks
2.16.1,
2.19.4];
(c)
constant
multiple
rigidity
[cf.
Corollary
2.19,
(iii);
Remarks
5.12.3,
5.12.5]
—
all
in
a
fashion
that
is
compatible
with
the
topology
of
the
tempered
fundamental
group
as
well
as
with
the
extension
structure
of
the
tempered
Frobenioid
[cf.
Corollary
5.12
and
the
discussion
of
the
following
remarks].
In
particular,
the
phenomenon
of
“cyclotomic
rigidity”
gives
a
“category-theoretic”
explanation
for
the
special
role
played
by
the
ﬁrst
power
[i.e.,
as
opposed
to
the
4
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
M
-th
power,
for
M
>
1
an
integer]
of
[the
l-th
root,
when
one
works
with
l-torsion
points,
for
l
≥
1
an
odd
integer,
of]
the
theta
function
[cf.
Remarks
2.19.2,
2.19.3,
5.10.3,
5.12.5]
—
a
phenomenon
which
may
also
be
seen
in
“scheme-theoretic”
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
[a
theory
that
also
eﬀectively
involves
[sections
of]
the
ﬁrst
power
of
some
ample
line
bundle,
and
which
does
not
generalize
in
any
evident
way
to
arbitrary
powers
of
this
ample
line
bundle].
One
further
interesting
aspect
of
cyclotomic
rigidity
in
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
is
that
it
is
obtained
essentially
as
the
result
of
a
certain
computation
involving
commutators
[cf.
Remark
2.19.2].
Put
another
way,
one
may
think
of
this
cyclotomic
rigidity
as
a
sort
of
consequence
of
the
nonabelian
structure
of
[what
essentially
amounts,
from
a
more
classical
point
of
view,
to]
the
“theta-group”.
This
application
of
the
structure
of
the
theta-group
diﬀers
substantially
from
the
way
in
which
the
structure
of
the
theta-group
is
used
in
more
classical
treatments
of
the
theory
of
theta
functions
—
namely,
to
show
that
certain
representations,
such
as
those
arising
from
theta
functions,
are
irreducible.
One
way
to
understand
this
diﬀerence
is
as
follows.
Whereas
classical
treatments
that
center
around
such
irreducibility
results
only
treat
certain
l-dimensional
subspaces
of
the
l2
-dimensional
space
of
set-theoretic
functions
on
the
l-torsion
points
of
an
elliptic
curve,
HodgeArakelov
theory
is
concerned
with
understanding
[“modulo”
the
l-dimensional
subspace
which
has
already
been
well
understood
in
the
classical
theory!]
the
entire
l2
-dimensional
function
space
that
appears
[cf.
[Mzk4],
§1.1].
Put
another
way,
the
l-dimensional
subspace
which
forms
the
principal
topic
of
the
classical
theory
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
the
space
of
holomorphic
functions
[cf.
[Mzk4],
§1.4.2];
by
contrast,
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
—
cf.,
e.g.,
the
arithmetic
KodairaSpencer
morphism
of
[Mzk4],
§1.4
—
is
concerned
with
understanding
deformations
of
the
holomorphic
structure,
from
an
arithmetic
point
of
view.
Moreover,
from
the
point
of
view
of
considering
such
deformations
of
holomorphic
structure,
it
is
convenient,
and,
indeed,
more
eﬃcient,
to
work
“modulo
variations
contained
within
the
subspace
corresponding
to
the
holomorphic
functions”
—
which,
at
any
rate,
may
be
treated,
as
a
consequence
of
the
classical
theory
of
irreducible
representations
of
the
theta-group,
as
a
single
“irreducible
unit”!
This
is
precisely
the
point
of
view
of
the
“Lagrangian
approach”
of
[Mzk5],
§3,
an
approach
which
allows
one
to
work
“modulo
the
l-dimensional
subspace
of
the
classical
theory”,
by
applying
various
isogenies
that
allow
one
to
replace
the
“entire
l2
-dimensional
function
space”
associated
to
the
original
elliptic
curve
by
an
l-dimensional
function
space
that
is
suited
to
studying
“arithmetic
deformations
of
holomorphic
structure”
in
the
style
of
Hodge-Arakelov
theory.
In
the
present
paper,
these
isogenies
of
the
“Lagrangian
approach
to
Hodge-Arakelov
theory”
correspond
to
the
various
coverings
that
appear
in
the
discussion
at
the
beginning
of
§2;
the
resulting
“l-dimensional
function
space”
then
corresponds,
in
the
theory
of
the
present
paper,
to
the
space
of
functions
on
the
labels
that
appear
in
Corollary
2.9.
Here,
it
is
important
to
note
that
although
the
above
three
rigidity
properties
may
be
stated
and
understood
to
a
certain
extent
without
reference
to
the
Frobenioid-theoretic
portion
of
the
theory
[cf.
§2],
certain
aspects
of
the
interdependence
of
these
rigidity
properties,
as
well
as
the
meaning
of
establishing
these
rigidity
properties
under
the
condition
of
compatibility
with
the
topology
of
the
THE
ÉTALE
THETA
FUNCTION
5
tempered
fundamental
group
as
well
as
with
the
extension
structure
of
the
tempered
Frobenioid,
may
only
be
understood
in
the
context
of
the
theory
of
Frobenioids
[cf.
Corollary
5.12
and
the
discussion
of
the
following
remarks].
Indeed,
one
important
theme
of
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
—
which
may,
roughly,
be
summarized
as
the
idea
that
sometimes
“less
(respectively,
more)
data
yields
more
(respectively,
less)
information”
[cf.
Remark
5.12.9]
—
is
precisely
the
study
of
the
rather
intricate
way
in
which
these
various
rigidity/compatibility
properties
are
related
to
one
another.
Typically
speaking,
the
reason
for
this
[at
ﬁrst
glance
somewhat
paradoxical]
phenomenon
is
that
“more
data”
means
more
complicated
systems
made
up
of
various
components,
hence
obligates
one
to
keep
track
of
the
various
indeterminacies
that
arise
in
relating
[i.e.,
without
resorting
to
the
use
of
“arbitrary
choices”]
these
components
to
one
another.
If
these
indeterminacies
are
suﬃciently
severe,
then
they
may
have
the
eﬀect
of
obliterating
certain
structures
that
one
is
interested
in.
By
contrast,
if
certain
portions
of
such
a
system
are
redundant,
i.e.,
in
fact
uniquely
and
rigidly
—
i.e.,
“canonically”
—
determined
by
more
fundamental
portions
of
the
system,
then
one
need
not
contend
with
the
indeterminacies
that
arise
from
relating
the
redundant
components;
this
yields
a
greater
chance
that
the
structures
of
interest
are
not
obliterated
by
the
intrinsic
indeterminacies
of
the
system.
One
way
to
appreciate
the
“tension”
that
exists
between
the
various
rigidity
properties
satisﬁed
by
the
mono-theta
environment
is
by
comparing
the
theory
of
the
mono-theta
environment
to
that
of
the
bi-theta
environment
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.13,
(iii)].
The
bi-theta
environment
is
essentially
a
Kummer-theoretic
version
of
the
pair
of
sections
—
corresponding
to
the
“numerator”
and
“denominator”
of
the
theta
function
—
of
a
certain
ample
line
bundle
on
a
Tate
curve.
One
of
these
two
sections
is
the
theta
trivialization
that
appears
in
the
mono-theta
environment;
the
other
of
these
two
sections
is
the
“algebraic
section”
that
arises
tautologically
from
the
original
deﬁnition
of
the
ample
line
bundle.
The
bi-theta
environment
satisﬁes
cyclotomic
rigidity
and
constant
multiple
rigidity
properties
for
somewhat
more
evident
reasons
than
the
mono-theta
environment.
In
the
case
of
constant
multiple
rigidity,
this
arises
partly
from
the
fact
that
the
bi-theta
environment
involves
working,
in
essence,
with
a
ratio
[i.e.,
in
the
form
of
a
“pair”]
of
sections,
hence
is
immune
to
the
operation
of
multiplying
both
sections
by
a
constant
[cf.
Remarks
5.10.4;
5.12.7,
(ii)].
On
the
other
hand,
the
bi-theta
environment
fails
to
satisfy
the
discrete
rigidity
property
satisﬁed
by
the
mono-theta
environment
[cf.
Corollary
2.16;
Remark
2.16.1].
By
contrast,
the
mono-theta
environment
satisﬁes
all
three
rigidity
properties,
despite
the
fact
that
cyclotomic
rigidity
[cf.
the
proof
of
Corollary
2.19,
(i);
Remark
2.19.2]
and
constant
multiple
rigidity
[cf.
Remarks
5.12.3,
5.12.5]
are
somewhat
more
subtle.
Here,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
issue
of
discrete
rigidity
for
the
mono
theta
and
bi-theta
environments
revolves,
in
essence,
around
the
fact
that

2.16.1.
On
the
other
hand,
the
subtlety
of
constant
multiple

for
mono-theta

revolves,
in
essence,
around
the
nontriviality
of
the
extension
structure
of

a
Frobenoid
[i.e.,
as
an
“extension
by
line
bundles
of
the
base
category”
—
cf.
Remarks
5.10.2,
5.12.3,
5.12.5,
5.12.7].
Put
another
way:
The
mono-theta
environment
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
translation
apparatus
that
serves
to
translate
the
“global
arithmetic
gap
between

[cf.
Remark
2.16.2
for
more
on
the
relation
of
this
portion
Z
and
Z”
of
the
theory
to
global
arithmetic
bases]
into
the
“nontriviality
of
the
local
geometric
extension”
constituted
by
the
extension
structure
of
the
tempered
Frobenioid
under
consideration.

and
This
sort
of
relationship
between
the
global
arithmetic
gap
between
Z
and
Z
the
theory
of
theta
functions
is
reminiscent
of
the
point
of
view
that
theta
functions
are
related
to
“splittings
of
the
natural
surjection
Z

Z/N
Z”,
a
point
of
view
that
arises
in
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
[cf.
[Mzk4],
§1.3.3].
The
contents
of
the
present
paper
are
organized
as
follows.
In
§1,
we
discuss
the
purely
tempered
étale-theoretic
anabelian
aspects
of
the
theta
function
and
show,
in
particular,
that
the
“étale
theta
function”
—
i.e.,
the
Kummer
class
of
the
usual
formal
algebraic
theta
function
—
is
preserved
by
isomorphisms
of
the
tempered
fundamental
group
[cf.
Theorems
1.6;
1.10].
In
§2,
after
studying
various
coverings
and
quotient
coverings
of
a
punctured
elliptic
curve,
we
introduce
the
notions
of
a
mono-theta
environment
and
a
bi-theta
environment
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.13]
and
study
the
“group-theoretic
constructibility”
and
rigidity
properties
of
these
notions
[cf.
Corollaries
2.18,
2.19].
In
§3,
we
deﬁne
the
“tempered
Frobenioids”
in
which
we
shall
develop
the
Frobenioid-theoretic
approach
to
the
étale
theta
function;
in
particular,
we
show
that
these
tempered
Frobenioids
satisfy
various
nice
properties
which
allow
one
to
apply
the
extensive
theory
of
[Mzk17],
[Mzk18]
[cf.
Theorem
3.7;
Corollary
3.8].
In
§4,
we
develop
“bi-Kummer
theory”
—
i.e.,
a
sort
of
generalization
of
the
“Kummer
class
associated
to
a
rational
function”
to
the
“bi-Kummer
data”
associated
to
a
pair
of
sections
[corresponding
to
the
numerator
and
denominator
of
a
rational
function]
of
a
line
bundle
—
in
a
category-theoretic
fashion
[cf.
Theorem
4.4]
for
fairly
general
tempered
Frobenioids.
Finally,
in
§5,
we
specialize
the
theory
of
§3,
§4
to
the
case
of
the
étale
theta
function,
as
discussed
in
§1.
In
particular,
we
observe
that
a
mono-theta
environment
may
also
be
regarded
as
a
mathematical
structure
naturally
associated
to
a
certain
tempered
Frobenioid
[cf.
Theorem
5.10,
(iii)].
Also,
we
discuss
certain
aspects
of
the
constant
multiple
rigidity
[as
well
as,
to
a
lesser
extent,
of
the
cyclotomic
and
discrete
rigidity]
of
a
mono-theta
environment
that
may
only
be
understood
in
the
context
of
the
Frobenioid-theoretic
approach
to
the
étale
theta
function
[cf.
Corollary
5.12
and
the
discussion
of
the
following
remarks].

Notations
and
Conventions
In
addition
to
the
“Notations
and
Conventions”
of
[Mzk17],
§0,
we
shall
employ
the
following
“Notations
and
Conventions”
in
the
present
paper:
Monoids:
We
shall
denote
by
N≥1
the
multiplicative
monoid
of
[rational]
integers
≥
1
[cf.
[Mzk17],
§0].
Let
Q
be
a
commutative
monoid
[with
unity];
P
⊆
Q
a
submonoid.
If
Q
is
integral
[so
Q
embeds
into
its
groupiﬁcation
Qgp
;
we
have
a
natural
inclusion
P
gp
→
Qgp
],
then
we
shall
refer
to
the
submonoid
P
gp

Q
(⊆
Qgp
)
of
Q
as
the
group-saturation
of
P
in
Q;
if
P
is
equal
to
its
group-saturation
in
Q,
then
we
shall
say
that
P
is
group-saturated
in
Q.
If
Q
is
torsion-free
[so
Q
embeds
into
its
perfection
Qpf
;
we
have
a
natural
inclusion
P
pf
→
Qpf
],
then
we
shall
refer
to
the
submonoid

P
pf
Q
(⊆
Qpf
)
of
Q
as
the
perf-saturation
of
P
in
Q;
if
P
is
equal
to
its
perf-saturation
in
Q,
then
we
shall
say
that
P
is
perf-saturated
in
Q.
Topological
Groups:
Let
Π
be
a
topological
group.
Then
let
us
write
Btemp
(Π)
for
the
category
whose
objects
are
countable
[i.e.,
of
cardinality
≤
the
cardinality
of
the
set
of
natural
numbers],
discrete
sets
equipped
with
a
continuous
Π-action
and
whose
morphisms
are
morphisms
of
Π-sets
[cf.
[Mzk14],
§3].
If
Π
may
be
written
as
an
inverse
limit
of
an
inverse
system
of
surjections
of
countable
discrete
topological
groups,
then
we
shall
say
that
Π
is
tempered
[cf.
[Mzk14],
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(i)].
We
shall
refer
to
a
normal
open
subgroup
H
⊆
Π
such
that
the
quotient
group
Π/H
is
free
as
co-free.
We
shall
refer
to
a
co-free
subgroup
H
⊆
Π
as
minimal
if
every
co-free
subgroup
of
Π
contains
H.
Thus,
a
minimal
co-free
subgroup
of
Π
is
necessarily
unique
and
characteristic.
Categories:
We
shall
refer
to
an
isomorphic
copy
of
some
object
as
an
isomorph
of
the
object.

Let
C
be
a
category;
A
∈
Ob(C).
Then
we
shall
write
CA
for
the
category
whose
objects
are
morphisms
B
→
A
of
C
and
whose
morphisms
[from
an
object
B1
→
A
to
an
object
B2
→
A]
are
A-morphisms
B1
→
B2
in
C
[cf.
[Mzk17],
§0]
and
C[A]
⊆
C
for
the
full
subcategory
of
C
determined
by
the
objects
of
C
that
admit
a
morphism
to
A.
Given
two
arrows
fi
:
Ai
→
Bi
(where
i
=
1,

in
C,
we
shall
refer
to

where
the
horizontal
arrows
are

in

—
as
an
abstract
equivalence
from
f1
to

.
If
there
exists
an
abstract
equivalence
from
f1
to
f2
,
then
we
shall
say
that
f1
,
f2
are
abstractly
equivalent.
Let
Φ
:
C
→
D
be
a
faithful
functor
between
categories
C,
D.
Then
we
shall
∼
say
that
Φ
is
isomorphism-full
if
every
isomorphism
Φ(A)

Φ(B)
of
D,
where
∼
A,
B
∈
Ob(C),
arises
by
applying
Φ
to
an
isomorphism
A
→
B
of
C.
Suppose
that
Φ
is
isomorphism-full.
Then
observe
that
the
objects
of
D
that
are
isomorphic
to
objects
in
the
image
of
Φ,
together
with
the
morphisms
of
D
that
are
abstractly
equivalent
to
morphisms
in
the
image
of
Φ,
form
a
subcategory
C

⊆
D
such
that
∼
Φ
induces
an
equivalence
of
categories
C

C

.
We
shall
refer
to
this
subcategory
C

⊆
D
as
the
essential
image
of
Φ.
[Thus,
this
terminology
is
consistent
with
the
usual
terminology
of
“essential
image”
in
the
case
where
Φ
is
fully
faithful.]
Curves:
We
refer
to
[Mzk14],
§0,
for
generalities
concerning
[families
of
]
hyperbolic
curves,
smooth
log
curves,
stable
log
curves,
divisors
of
cusps,
and
divisors
of

If
C

S
log

a

log
curve,
and,
moreover,
S
is
the

of
a

then
we
shall
say
that
C
log
is
split
if
each
of
the

Thus,
the
divisor
of

of

determines
a

of
cusps
of
C1log

C

.
Here,
if
C2log

is
of
type
(1,

and
the
ﬁnite
group
of
automorphisms
is
given
by
the

of

[i.e.,
relative
to
the
group
structure
of
the
underlying

of

then
the
resulting
stable

will
be
referred
to
as
being

(1,

If
S
log
is
the
spectrum
of
a
ﬁeld,
equipped
with
the
trivial
log
structure,
then
a
hyperbolic
orbicurve
X

is
deﬁned
to
be
the
algebraic

obtained
by
removing
the
divisor
of
cusps
from
some
smooth

C

S

.
If
X
(respectively,
Y
)
is
a
hyperbolic
orbicurve
over
a
ﬁeld
K
(respectively,

then
we
shall
say
that
X
is

Y
if
there

Section
1:
The
Tempered
Anabelian
Rigidity
of
the
Étale
Theta
Function
In
this
§,
we
construct
a
certain
cohomology
class
in
the
[continuous]
group
cohomology
of
the
tempered
fundamental
group
of
a
once-punctured
elliptic
curve
which
may
be
regarded
as
a
sort
of
“tempered
analytic”
representation
of
the
theta
function.
We
then
discuss
various
properties
of
this
“étale
theta
function”.
In
particular,
we
apply
the
theory
of
[Mzk14],
§6,
to
show
that
it
is,
up
to
certain
relatively
mild
indeterminacies,
preserved
by
arbitrary
automorphisms
of
the
tempered
fundamental
group
[cf.
Theorems
1.6,
1.10].
Let
K
be
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
,
with
ring
of
integers
OK
;
K
an
algebraic
closure
of
K;
S
the
formal
scheme
determined
by
the
p-adic
completion
of
Spec(OK
);
Slog
the
formal
log
scheme
obtained
by
equipping
S
with
the
log
structure
determined
by
the
unique
closed
point
of
Spec(OK
);
Xlog
a
stable
log
curve
over
Slog
of
type
(1,
1).
Also,
we
assume
that
the
special
ﬁber
of
X
is
singular
and
split
[cf.
§0],
and
that
the
generic
ﬁber
of
the
algebrization
of
Xlog
is
a
smooth
log
curve.
Write
def
X
log
=
Xlog
×OK
K
for
the
ringed
space
with
log
structure
obtained
by
tensoring
the
structure
sheaf
of
X
over
OK
with
K.
In
the
following
discussion,
we
shall
often
[by
abuse
of
notation]
use
the
notation
X
log
also
to
denote
the
generic
ﬁber
of
the
algebrization
of
Xlog
.
[Here,
the
reader
should
note
that
these
notational
conventions
diﬀer
somewhat
from
notational
conventions
typically
employed
in
discussions
of
rigid-analytic
geometry.]
Let
us
write
Πtp
X
for
the
tempered
fundamental
group
associated
to
X
log
[cf.
[André],
§4;
the
group
log
)”
of
[Mzk14],
Examples
3.10,
5.6],
with
respect
to
some
basepoint.
The
“π1temp
(XK
issue
of
how
our
constructions
are
aﬀected
when
the
basepoint
varies
will
be
studied
in
the
present
paper
by
considering
to
what
extent
these
constructions
are
preserved
by
inner
or,
more
generally,
arbitrary
isomorphisms
between
fundamental
groups
[cf.
Remark
1.6.2
below].
Here,
despite
the
fact
that
the
[tempered]
fundamental
group
in
question
is
best
thought
of
not
as
“the
fundamental
group
of
X”
but
rather
tp
as
“the
fundamental
group
of
X
log
”,
we
use
the
notation
“Πtp
X
”
rather
than
“ΠX
log
”
in
order
to
minimize
the
number
of
subscripts
and
superscripts
that
appear
in
the
notation
[cf.
the
discussion
to
follow
in
the
remainder
of
the
present
paper!];
thus,
the
reader
should
think
of
the
underlined
notation
“Πtp
(−)
”
as
an
abbreviation
for
the
“logarithmic
tempered
fundamental
group
of
the
scheme
(−),
equipped
with
the
log
structure
currently
under
consideration”,
i.e.,
an
abbreviation
for
“π1temp
((−)log
)”.

Denote

it

that

Set

equal

One
veriﬁes
easily
that
the
special

is
an
inﬁnite
chain
of
copies
of
the
projective
line,
joined
at
0

each

“0”
and
“∞”
is
a
node
on

each

this
chain
maps
to
a
projective

in
the
special
ﬁber
of
Y
by
the
“N
-th
power
map”
on
the
copy
of
“Gm

obtained
by
removing
the
nodes;
if
we
choose
some
irreducible
component
of
the
special
ﬁber
of
Y
as
a
“basepoint”,
then
the
natural
action
of
Z
on

allows
one
to
think
of
the
projective
lines
in
the
special
ﬁber
of
Y
as
being
labeled
by
elements
of
Z.
In
particular,
it
follows
immediately
that
the
isomorphism
class
of
a
line

on

is
completely
determined
by
the
degree
of
the
restriction
of
the

to
each

is
to

these

we

it

that

Proof.
First,
observe
that
by
the
discussion
above
[concerning
the

it
follows
that
the

preserves

also

then
one

veriﬁes
immediately
[by

that

where

is
an

Indeed,
one
veriﬁes
immediately,
by
considering
various
relevant
line

on
“Gm

that
[if
we
write
U
for
the
standard
multiplicative
coordinate
on

this

represents
an

maps

Now
consider
the
tautological
Z/N
Z(1)-torsor
RN

YN
obtained
by
extracting
an
N

of
s1

More
explicitly,
RN

be
thought
of
as
the
ﬁnite

the
“algebra

is
deﬁned
by
the
morphism
L⊗−N

OYN
given
by
N
multiplying
by
s1
|YN
.
In
particular,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
def
GN
that
GN
acts
naturally
on
(RN
)JN
=
RN
×OKN
JN
.
Since
s1
|YN
has
zeroes
of
order
1
at
each
of
the
cusps
of
YN
,
it
thus
follows
immediately
that
(RN

is
def
connected
and
Galois
over
XJN

and
that
one
has
an

GN

Gal((RN

arising
from
the
natural
action
of
GN
on

Since
the
abelian
group
Δtp
X
/ΔYN
acts
trivially
on
μN
(JN
),
and
HN
is
annihilated
by
N
,
it
thus
follows
formally
from
the
deﬁnition
of
(ΔX
)Θ
[i.e.,
as
the
quotient
by
a
certain
“double
commutator

that
at
least
“geometrically”,
there
exists
a
map
from
ZN

More
precisely,
there
is
a

This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Next,
we
consider

tp

the

the

follow
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions
[cf.

the

Moreover,
since
sN

deﬁned
over

it
is
immediate
tp
that
this

factors
through

Finally,
the
asserted
faithfulness
follows
from
the
fact
that

1
at

Now
we
deﬁne
DN
to
be
the
eﬀective
divisor
on

is
supported
on
the

and
corresponds
to

THE

—
i.e.,
at
the
irreducible
component
labeled
j,
the
divisor
DN
is
equal
to
the
divisor
j
2
/2N
.
Note
that
since
the
completion
of
ŸN
given
by
the
schematic
zero
locus
of
qX
at
each
node
of
its
special
ﬁber
is
isomorphic
to
the
ring
1/2N
OJ¨N
[[u,
v]]/(uv
−
qX
)
—
where
u,
v
are
indeterminates
—
it
follows
that
this
divisor
DN
is
Cartier.
Moreover,
a
simple
calculation
of
degrees
reveals
that
we
have
an
isomorphism
of
line
bundles
on
ŸN
OŸN
(DN
)
∼
=
L̈N
—
i.e.,
there
exists
a
section,
well-deﬁned
up
to
an
OJ×¨
-multiple,
∈
Γ(ŸN
,
L̈N
)
N
whose
zero
locus
is
precisely
the
divisor
DN
.
That
is
to
say,
we
have
a
commutative

refer

as
the
theta

of

is
a
section
whose

is
equal

Moreover,
since
the

clearly
ﬁxes
the

we
conclude
that
the

always
preserves

up

Next,
let

an
integer

Then

i.e.,
commutes
up

[Indeed,
this

Thus,
since
by
the
classical
theory
of
the
theta
function
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Mumf],
pp.
306-307;
the
relation
“Θ̈(−Ü
)
=
−Θ̈(Ü)”
given
in
Proposition
1.4,
(ii),
below],
it
follows
that
one
may
choose
τ1
so
that
the
natural
action
of
Πtp
Y
on
V(L̈1
)
[arising
from
the
fact
that
L̈1
is
the
pull-back
of
the
line
bundle
L1
on
Y;
cf.
the
action
of
Proposition
1.1,
(ii)]
preserves
±τ1
,
we
conclude,
in
light
of
the
deﬁnition
of
J¨N
,
the
following:
Lemma
1.2.
(Compatibility
of
Theta
Trivializations)
By
modifying
the
⊗N
/N
various
τN
by
suitable
OJ×¨
-multiples,
one
may
assume
that
τN1
1
2
=
τN2
,
for
all
N
positive
integers
N1
,
N2
such
that
N2
|N1
.
In
particular,
there
exists
a
compatible
tp
system
[as
N
varies
over
the
positive
integers]
of
actions
of
Πtp
Y
(respectively,
ΠŸ
)
on
ŸN
,
V(L̈N
)
which
preserve
τN
.
Finally,
each
action
of
this
system
diﬀers
from
the
action
determined
by
the
action
of
Proposition
1.1,
(ii),
by
multiplication
by
a(n)
2N
-th
root
of
unity
(respectively,
N
-th
root
of
unity).
Thus,
by
taking
the
τN
to
be
as
in
Lemma
1.2
and
applying
the
natural
isotp

to
the
diﬀerence
between
the
actions
of

from

Remark
1.3.1.
Note
that
the
denominators
“
12
”
in
Proposition
1.3
are
by
no
means
superﬂuous:
Indeed,
this
follows
immediately
from
the
fact
that
the
divisor
D1
on
Ÿ
clearly
does
not
descend
to
Y.
Let
us
denote
by
U⊆Y
the
open
formal
subscheme
obtained
by
removing
the
nodes
from
the
irreducible
component
of
the
special
ﬁber
labeled
0
∈
Z.
If
we
take
the
unique
cusp
lying
in
U
as
the
origin,
then
—
as
is
well-known
from
the
theory
of
the
Tate
curve
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Mumf],
pp.
306-307]
—
the
group
structure
on
the
underlying
elliptic
curve
of
X
log
determines
a
group
structure
on
U,
together
with
a
unique
[in
light
of
our
choice
of
an
orientation
on
the
dual
graph
of
the
special
ﬁber
of
Y]
isomorphism
of
U
with
the
p-adic
formal
completion
of
Gm
over
OK
.
In
particular,
this
isomorphism
determines
a
multiplicative
coordinate
U
∈
Γ(U,
OU×
)

so
Θ̈
extends
uniquely
to
a
meromorphic
function
on
Ÿ
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Mumf],
pp.
306-307].
Then:
(i)
The
zeroes
of
Θ̈

precisely
the
cusps
of
Ÿ;
each
zero
has
multiplicity
1.
The
divisor

is
precisely
the

are
precisely
the
“Kummer

associated
to

regarded
as
a
regular
function
on

.
In
particular,
if

is
a

A
similar

equal

holds
if
y

a

if
one
restricts

compatible
with
the
canonical
integral
structure
[cf.
[Mzk13],
Deﬁnition

on

.
In
light
of
this
relationship
between
the
cohomology
classes
of
Proposition
1.3
and
the
values
of
Θ̈,
we
shall
sometimes
refer
to
these
classes
as
“the
étale

function”.
Proof.
Assertion
(ii)
is
a
routine
calculation
involving
the
series
used
to
deﬁne
a/2
Θ̈.
A
similar
calculation
shows
that
Θ̈(±1)
=
0.
The
formula
given
for
Θ̈(qX
Ü
)
in
assertion
(ii)
shows
that
the
portion
of
the
divisor
of
poles
supported
in
the
special
ﬁber
of
Ÿ
is
equal
to
D1
.
This
formula
also
shows
that
to
complete
the
proof
of
assertion
(i),
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
the
given
description

poles
of

is
accurate
over
the
irreducible

But
this
follows
immediately
from
the
fact
that

As
for
assertion
(ii),
the
fact
that
γ
induces
an
isomorphism
(ΔΘ
)α
→
(ΔΘ
)β
is
immediate
[in
light
of
the
argument
used
to
verify
assertion
(i)]
from
the
deﬁnitions.
The
asserted
compatibility
then
follows
from
[Mzk14],
Theorem
6.12;
[Mzk2],
Proposition
1.2.1,
(iv),
(vi),
(vii).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
By
composing
γ
with
an
appropriate
inner
automorphism
of
Πtp
Xβ
,
it
follows
from
[Mzk14],
Theorem
6.8,
(ii),
that
we
may
∼
assume
that
the
isomorphism
Πtp

Πtp
is
compatible
with

,
ιβ
[cf.
Proposition

on
both
sides.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
it
is
a
tautology
that
γ
is
compatible
with
the
symbols
“log(Θ)”
of
Proposition
1.5,
(i),
(ii).
On
the
other
hand,
by
Proposition
1.5,
(ii),
(iii),
the
property
of
“mapping

log(Θ)
in
the

completely
determines
the

η̈
Θ
up
to
a
(K̈

Thus,
to
complete
the
proof,
it
suﬃces
to
reduce
this
“indeterminacy

to
a
(K̈
×
)∧
-multiple”
to
an
“indeterminacy
up

may
be
achieved
[in
This
“reduction

light
of
the

(ii)]
by
evaluating
the

η̈
Θ
at
a
cusp
that
maps
to
the
irreducible

of
the
special

of
Ÿ
labeled

[e.g.,
a
cusp
that
is
preserved
by
the
inversion
automorphism]
via
the
canonical
integral
structure,
as
in
Proposition
1.4,
(iii),
and
applying
the
fact
that,
by
[Mzk14],
Theorem
6.5,
(iii);
[Mzk14],
Corollary
6.11,
γ
preserves
both
the
decomposition
groups
and
the
canonical
integral
structures
[on
the
decomposition
groups]
of
cusps.
Remark
1.6.1.
In
the
proof
of
Theorem
1.6,
(iii),
we
eliminated
the
“indeterminacy”
in
question
by
restricting
to
cusps,
via
the
canonical
integral
structure.
Another
way
to
eliminate
this
indeterminacy
is
to
restrict
to
non-cuspidal
torsion
points,
which
are
temp-absolute
by
[Mzk14],
Theorem
6.8,
(iii).
This
latter
approach
amounts
to
invoking
the
theory
of
[Mzk13],
§2,
which
is,
in
some
sense,
less
elementary
[for
instance,
in
the
sense
that
it
makes
use,
in
a
much
more
essential
way,
of
the
main
result
of
[Mzk11]]
than
the
theory
of
[Mzk13],
§4
[which
one
is,
in
eﬀect,
applying
if
one
uses
cusps].
Remark
1.6.2.
One
way
of
thinking
about
isomorphisms
of
the
tempered
fundamental
group
is
that
they
arise
from
variation
of
the
basepoint,
or
underlying
set
theory,
relative
to
which
one
considers
the
associated
“temperoids”
[cf.
[Mzk14],
§3].
Indeed,
this
is
the
point
of
view
taken
in
[Mzk12],
in
the
case
of
anabelioids.
From
this
point
of
view,
the
content
of
Theorem
1.6
may
be
interpreted
as
stating
that:
24
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
The
étale
theta
function
is
preserved
by
arbitrary
“changes
of
the
underlying
set
theory”
relative
to
which
one
considers
the
tempered
fundamental
group
in
question.
When
viewed
in
this
way,
Theorem
1.6
may
be
thought
of
—
especially
if
one
takes
the
non-cuspidal
approach
of
Remark
1.6.1
—
as
a
sort
of
nonarchimedean
analogue
of
the
so-called
functional
equation
of
the
classical
complex
theta
function,
which
also
states
that
the
“theta
function”
is
preserved,
in
eﬀect,
by
“changes
of
the
underlying
set
theory”
relative
to
which
one
considers
the
integral
singular
cohomology
of
the
elliptic
curve
in
question,
i.e.,
more
concretely,
by
the
action
of
the
modular
group
SL2
(Z).
Note
that
in
the
complex
case,
it
is
crucial,
in
order
to
prove
the
functional
equation,
to
have
not
only
the
“Schottky
uniformization”
C×

C×
/q
Z
by
C×
—
which
naturally
gives
rise
to
the
analytic
series
representation
of
the
theta
function,
but
is
not,
however,
preserved
by
the
action
of
the
modular
group
—
but
also
the
full
uniformization
of
an
elliptic
curve
by
C
[which
is
preserved
by
the
action
of
the
modular
group].
This
“preservation
of
the
full
uniformization
by
C”
in
the
complex
case
may
be
regarded
as
being
analogous
to
the
preservation
of
the
non-cuspidal
torsion
points
in
the
approach
to
proving
Theorem
1.6
discussed
in
Remark
1.6.1.
Remark
1.6.3.
The
interpretation
of
Theorem
1.6
given
in
Remark
1.6.2
is
reminiscent
of
the
discussion
given
in
the
Introduction
of
[Mzk7],
in
which
the
author
expresses
his
hope,
in
eﬀect,
that
some
sort
of
p-adic
analogue
of
the
functional
equation
of
the
theta
function
could
be
developed.

immediately

THE

25
×
In
fact,
it
is
possible
to
eliminate
the
OK̈
-indeterminacy
of
Theorem
1.6,
(iii),
to
a
substantial
extent
[cf.
[Mzk13],
Corollary
4.12].
For
simplicity,
let
us
assume
in
the
following
discussion
that
the
following
two
conditions
hold:
(I)
K
=
K̈.
(II)
The
hyperbolic
curve
determined
by
X
log
is
not
arithmetic
over
K
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk3],
Remark
2.1.1].
As
is
well-known,
condition
(II)
amounts,
relative
to
the
j-invariant
of
the
elliptic
curve
underlying
X,
to
the
assertion
that
we
exclude
four
exceptional
j-invariants
[cf.
[Mzk3],
Proposition
2.7].
Now
let
us
write
Ẍ
log
→
X
log
for
the
Galois
[by
condition
(I)]
covering
of
degree
4
determined
by
the
“multiplication
by
2”
map
on
the
elliptic
curve
underlying
X;
write
X
log
→
C
log
for
the
stack-theoretic
quotient
of
X
log
by
the
natural
action
of
±1
on
[the
underlying
elliptic
curve
of]
X.
Thus,
[by
condition
(II)]
the
hyperbolic
orbicurve
determined
by
C
log
is
a
K-core
[cf.
[Mzk3],
Remark
2.1.1].
Observe
that
the
covering
Ẍ
log
→
C
log
is
Galois,
with
Galois
group
isomorphic
to
(Z/2Z)3
.
Moreover,
we
have
two
natural
automorphisms
μ
∈
Gal(Ẍ/X)
⊆
Gal(Ẍ/C);
±
∈
Gal(Ẍ/C)
—
i.e.,
respectively,
the
unique
nontrivial
element
of
Gal(Ẍ/X)
that
acts
trivially
on
the
set
of

components
of

ﬁber;
the
unique
nontrivial
element
of
Gal(Ẍ/C)
that
acts
trivially
on
the
set
of
cusps
of
Ẍ.
Now
suppose
that
we
are
given
a
nontrivial

Z

is

A
similar
statement
holds
when

replaced
by
“Π”.
Proof.
First,
we
consider
the
tempered
case.
By
[Mzk2],
Lemma
1.3.8,
it
follows
that
γ
is
compatible
with
the
respective
projections
to
GK

By
[Mzk14],
Theorem

[cf.

it

from

that

is
a

[i.e.,

contains
no

—
cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk16],
∼

it
follows
that

,
hence
∼
ell
ell
also
an

(Δtp

.
Moreover,
by
considering
the
discreteness
of

∼
=
Z
,
or,
alternatively,
the
triviality
of
the

it
follows
that
this
last

determines
an

that

Proof.
First,
we
observe
that
assertions
(i),
(iii)
follow
formally
from
assertion
(ii)
[cf.
also
the
series
representation
of
Proposition
1.4].
Now
we
verify
assertion
(ii),
as
follows.
By
applying
[Mzk14],
Theorem
6.8,
(iii),
together
with
the
fact
that
γ
induces
isomorphisms
between
the
dual
graphs
[cf.
Theorem
1.6,
(i);
[Mzk2],
Lemma
2.3]
of
the
special
ﬁbers
of
the
various
corresponding
coverings
of
Cα
,
Cβ
that
appear
in
the
proof
of
[Mzk14],
Theorem
6.8,
(iii),
it
follows
that
γ
maps
[the
decomposition
group
of
points
of
Ÿα
lying
over]
τ
to
[the
decomposition
group
of
points
of
Ÿβ
lying
over]
τ
±1
.
Now
assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately.
Remark
1.10.1.
(i)
The
“±-indeterminacy”
of
Theorem
1.10,
(i),
(iii),
is
reminiscent
of,
but
stronger
than,
the
indeterminacy
up
to
multiplication
by
a
12-th
root
of
unity
of
[Mzk13],
Corollary
4.12.
Also,
we
note
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
technique
of
the
proof
of
loc.
cit.,
applied
in
the
present
context
of
“Tate
curves”,
it
is
the
fact
that
there
is
a
“special
2-torsion
point”,
i.e.,
the
2-torsion
point
whose
image
in
the
special
ﬁber
lies
in
the
same
irreducible
component
as
the
origin,
that
allows
one
to
reduce
the
“12
=
2
·
(3!)”
of
loc.
cit.
to
“2”.
(ii)
We
take
this
opportunity
to
remark
that
in
[Mzk13],
Corollary
4.12,
the
author
omitted
the
hypothesis
that
“K
contain
a
primitive
12-th
root
of
unity”.
The
author
apologizes
for
this
omission.
Remark
1.10.2.
One
observation
that
one
might
make
is
that
since
Theorem
1.10
depends
on
the
theory
of
[Mzk13],
§2
[i.e.,
in
the
“tempered
version”
of
this
theory
given
in
[Mzk14],
§6],
one
natural
approach
to
further
strengthening
Theorem
1.10
is
to
consider
applying
the
“absolute
p-adic
version
of
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture”
of
[Mzk16],
Corollary
2.3,
which
may
be
regarded
as
a
“strengthening”
of
the
theory
of
[Mzk13],
§2.
One
problem
here,
however,
is
that
unlike
the
portion
of
the
theory
of
[Mzk13],
§2,
that
concerns
[non-cuspidal]
torsion
points
of
oncepunctured
elliptic
curves
[i.e.,
[Mzk13],
Corollary
2.6],
the
“absolute
p-adic
version
of
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture”
of
[Mzk16],
Corollary
2.3,
only
holds
for
elliptic
curves
which
are
deﬁned
over
number
ﬁelds.
Moreover,
even
if,
in
the
future,
this
hypothesis
should
be
eliminated,
the
[somewhat
weaker]
theory
of
[Mzk13],
§2,
follows
“formally”
[cf.
[Mzk13],
Remark
2.8.1]
from
certain
“general
nonsense”-type
THE
ÉTALE
THETA
FUNCTION
29
arguments
that
hold
over
any
base
over
which
the
relative
isomorphism
version
of
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
[i.e.,
the
isomorphism
portion
of
[Mzk11],
Theorem
A],
together
with
the
absolute
preservation
of
cuspidal
decomposition
groups
[cf.
[Mzk13],
Theorem
1.3,
(iii)],
holds.
In
particular,
by
restricting
our
attention
to
consequences
of
this
“general
nonsense”
in
the
style
of
[Mzk13],
§2,
one
may
hope
to
generalize
the
results
discussed
in
the
present
§1
to
much
more
general
bases
[such
as,
for
instance,
Zp
[[q]][q
−1
]
⊗
Qp
,
where
q
is
an
indeterminate
intended
to
suggest
the
“q-parameter
of
a
Tate
curve”],
or,
for
instance,
to
the
case
of
“pro-Σ
versions
of
the
tempered
fundamental
group”
[i.e.,
where
Σ
is
a
set
of
primes
containing
p
which
is
not
necessarily
the
set
of
all
prime
numbers]
—
situations
in
which
it
is
by
no
means
clear
[at
least
at
the
time
of
writing]
whether
or
not
it
is
possible
to
prove
an
“absolute
version
of
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture”.
Remark
1.10.3.
(i)
Note
that
the
étale
theta
function
arises
as
a
cohomology
class
of
a
certain
subgroup
of
the
“theta
quotient”
tp
Θ
Πtp
X

(ΠX
)
[cf.
Propositions
1.3,
1.5].
On
the
other
hand,
the
very
strong
rigidity
property
of
Theorem
1.10,
(i),
clearly
—
as
one
may
see,
for
instance,
by
considering
auΘ
tomorphisms
of
the
topological
group
(Πtp
—
fails
to
hold
if,
for
instance,
one
X)
tp
Θ
replaces
“ΠC
”
by
the
corresponding
“theta
quotient”
(Πtp
C
)
.
Thus,
even
though
at
ﬁrst
glance,
the
theory
of
the
étale
theta
function
may
appear
only
to
involve
tp
Θ
the
theta
quotient
(Πtp
X
)
,
in
fact,
the
full
tempered
fundamental
group
ΠX
plays
an
essential
role
in
the
theory
of
rigidity
properties
of
the
étale
theta
function.
(ii)
Relative
to
the
eventual
goal
of
applying
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
to
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
[cf.
the
Introduction]
—
which
concerns
restricting
the
theta
function
and
its
derivatives
to
torsion
points
—
the
necessity
of
working
with
the
full
tempered
fundamental
group
may
be
motivated
geometrically
as
follows.
The
hyperbolic
orbicurves
involved
may
be
thought
of,
up
to
isogeny
[cf.
§0],
as
the
hyperbolic
curves
obtained
by
removing
the
l-torsion
points
[for
some
integer
l
≥
1]
from
an
elliptic
curve
[cf.
especially
the
theory
of
§2
below].
At
the
level
of
topological
surfaces,
the
complement
Sell\tors
of
the
l-torsion
points
in
an
elliptic
curve
E
may
be
thought
of
as
the
result
Sell\tors
=
Sell\disc
Sdisc\tors
of
gluing
the
complement
Sell\disc
of
a
single
disc
in
an
elliptic
curve
to
the
complement
Sdisc\tors
in
a
disc
of
a
ﬁnite
collection
of
points
[i.e.,
where
the
gluing
is
along
the
circle
which
forms
the
boundary
of
the
discs
involved].
The
topological
fundamental
group
of
Sell\tors
may
then
be
thought
of
as
the
amalgamated
sum
of
the
fundamental
groups
of
Sell\disc
,
Sdisc\tors
.
Now
the
fundamental
group
of
Sell\disc
is
a
free
group
on
two
generators,
which
may
be
thought
of
as
a
basis
of
the
abelian
fundamental
group
of
the
original
elliptic
curve
E.
This
portion
of
the
fundamental
30
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
group
of
Sell\tors
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
the
“Heisenberg
group”,
or
theta-group
—
i.e.,
the
theta
quotient
discussed
in
(i)
—
which
plays
a
fundamental
role
in
the
theory
of
theta
functions,
hence
in
the
scheme-theoretic
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
reviewed
in
[Mzk4]
[cf.
especially
the
discussion
of
[Mzk4],
§1.3.5].
On
the
other
hand,
Sdisc\tors
is
homotopically
equivalent
to
a
bouquet
of
circles,
where
the
circles
correspond
naturally
to
the
l-torsion
points
of
E.
Thus,
from
the
point
of
view
of
algebraic
topology,
the
Sdisc\tors
portion
of
Sell\tors
may
be
thought
of
as
the
suspension
of
the
discrete
set
of
l-torsion
points
[together
with
some
additional
“basepoint”].
On
the
other
hand,
from
the
point
of
view
of
arithmetic
geometry,
the
circle
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“Tate
motive”
and
the
“arithmetic
suspension”
constituted
by
the
Sdisc\tors
portion
of
Sell\tors
as
a
sort
of
“anabelian
Tate
twist”
of
the
l-torsion
points
of
E.
Moreover,
from
the
point
of
view
of
HodgeArakelov
theory,
the
universal
covering
of
the
bouquet
constituted
by
Sdisc\tors
may
be
thought
of
as
the
result
of
“ﬁlling
in
the
discrete
set
of
l-torsion
points”
by
joining
these
points
via
continuous
line
segments
—
cf.
the
original
point
of
view
of
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
[discussed
in
[Mzk4],
§1.3.4]
to
the
eﬀect
that
the
set
of
torsion
points
is
to
be
regarded
as
a
“high
resolution
approximation”
of
the
underlying
real
analytic
manifold
of
E.
Put
another
way,
this
sort
of
“continuous
version
of
the
l-torsion
points”
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“cyclotomic
blurring”
of
the
l-torsion
points
—
i.e.,
a
sort
of
space
of
inﬁnitesimal
deformations
of
the
l-torsion
points
that
allows
one
to
consider
derivatives
[e.g.,
of
the
theta
function]
at
the
l-torsion
points.
Thus,
in
summary,
relative
to
these
geometric
considerations,
the

Sdisc\tors
,
hence
also
its
group-theoretic
topological
surface
Sell\tors
=
Sell\disc
counterpart
[i.e.,
the
full
fundamental
group
under
consideration]
may
be
thought
of
as
being
precisely
a
geometric
realization
of
the
content
(theta
functions
and
their
derivatives)|l-torsion
points
[i.e.,
where
“theta
functions”
correspond,
via
theta-groups,
to
Sell\disc
,
and
“derivatives
at
l-torsion
points”
correspond
to
Sdisc\tors
]
of
Hodge-Arakelov
theory.
Remark
1.10.4.
(i)
As
observed
in
Proposition
1.4,
(iii),
by
restricting
the
étale
theta
function
to
various
[e.g.,
torsion!]
points,
one
obtains
a
Kummer-theoretic
approach
to
considering
the
theta
function
as
a
function
on
points.
In
the
context
of
the
theory
of
the
present
§1
[and
indeed
of
the
present
paper],
in
which
one
does
not
assume
[cf.
Remark
1.10.2]
that
the
multiplicative
groups
associated
to
the
base
ﬁelds
involved
that
appear
in
the
absolute
Galois
groups
of
these
ﬁelds
—
e.g.,
the
“(L×
)∧
”
that
appears
in
Proposition
1.4,
(iii)
—
are
equipped
with
additive
structures
[i.e.,
arising
from
the
addition
operation
on
the
ﬁeld],
the
functions
that
may
be
obtained
in
this
way
are
very
special.
Indeed,
if
one
may
avail
oneself
of
both
the
additive
and
multiplicative
structures
—
i.e.,
the
ring
structures
—
of
the
ﬁelds
involved,
then
it
is
not
diﬃcult
to
give
various
“group-theoretic
algorithms”
for
constructing
all
sorts
of
such
“functions”.
On
the
other
hand:
If
one
may
only
avail
oneself
of
the
multiplicative
structure,
then
it
is
diﬃcult
to
construct
such
functions,
except
via
considering
directly
the
THE
ÉTALE
THETA
FUNCTION
31
functions
obtained
by
restricting
Kummer
classes
of
meromorphic
functions.
[Of
course,
the
multiplicative
structure
allows
one
to
construct
N
-th
powers,
for
N
≥
1
an
integer,
of
the
values
obtained
by
restricting
Kummer
classes,
but
such
N
-th
powers
are
simply
the
values
obtained
by
restricting
the
Kummer
classes
obtained
by
multiplying
the
original
Kummer
classes
by
N
.]
Finally,
we
recall
that
the
theta
function
satisﬁes
the
unusual
property,
among
meromorphic
functions
on
tempered
coverings
of
pointed
stable
curves,
of
having
a
divisor
of
poles
that
is
contained
in
the
special
ﬁber
and
a
divisor
zeroes
that
does
not
contain
any
irreducible
components
of
the
special
ﬁber
[cf.
Proposition
1.4,
(i)].
(ii)
Even
if
one
allows
oneself
to
consider
“Kummer
classes”

κ
∈
H
1
(Π,
Z(1))
for
Π
an
arbitrary
topological
group
that
surjects
onto
the
absolute
Galois
group
GK
of
a
ﬁnite
extension
K
of
Qp
,
it
is
not
diﬃcult
to
see
that
it
is
a
highly
nontrivial
operation
to
construct
functions
on
the
set
of
[conjugacy
classes
of]
sections
of
Π

GK
.
Indeed,
if
κ
is
to
give
rise
to
a
nontrivial
function,
then
it
is
natural

to
assume
that
it
must
induce
an
isomorphism
of
some
isomorph
[cf.
§0]
of
Z(1)

inside
Π
onto
Z(1)
[cf.
the
role
of
“ΔΘ
”
in
Proposition
1.3
in
the
case
of
the
étale

theta
function].
On
the
other
hand,
if,
for
instance,
Π
=
Z(1)

GK
,
then
[cf.
the
discussion
of
the
“theta
quotient”
in
Remark
1.10.3,
(i)]
it
is
easy
to
see
that
the
resulting
κ
fails
to
satisfy
the
analogue
of
the
rigidity
property
of
Theorem
1.10,
(i).
Thus,
just
as
in
the
discussion
of
Remark
1.10.3,
one
is
ultimately
led
naturally
to
consider
the
case
where
Π
is
some
sort
of
[e.g.,
tempered
or
proﬁnite]
arithmetic
group
of
a
hyperbolic
orbicurve,
in
which
case
various
strong
anabelian
rigidity
properties
are
known.
Moreover,
it
is
diﬃcult
to
see
how
to
develop
the
theory
of
§2
below
—
which
makes
essential
use,
in
so
many
ways,
of
the
theory
and
structure
of
theta-groups
[i.e.,
the
“theta
quotients”
of
Remark
1.10.3,
(i)]
—
for
hyperbolic
orbicurves
that
are
not
isogenous
to
once-punctured
elliptic
curves.
This
state
of
aﬀairs
again
serves
to
highlight
the
fact
that
the
function
[on,
say,
torsion
points]
determined
by
the
étale
theta
function
should
be
regarded
as
a
very
special
and
unusual
object.

Section
2:
The
Theory
of
Theta
Environments
In
this
§,
we
begin
by
discussing
various
“general
nonsense”
complements
[cf.
Corollaries
2.8,
2.9]
to
the
theory
of
étale
theta
functions
of
§1
involving
coverings
[cf.
the
discussion
of
the
“Lagrangian
approach
to
Hodge-Arakelov
theory”
in
the
Introduction].
This
discussion
leads
naturally
to
the
theory
of
the
cyclotomic
envelope
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.10]
and
the
associated
mono-
and
bi-theta
environments
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.13],
whose
tempered
anabelian
rigidity
properties
[cf.
Corollaries
2.18,
2.19]
we
shall
use
in
§5,
below,
to
relate
the
theory
of
the
present
§2
to
the
theory
of
tempered
Frobenioids
to
be
discussed
in
§3,
§4,
below.
Let
X
log
be
a
smooth
log
curve
of
type
(1,
1)
over
a
ﬁeld
K
of
characteristic
zero.
For
simplicity,
we
assume
that
the
hyperbolic
curve
determined
by
X
log
is
not
K-arithmetic
[i.e.,
admits
a
K-core
—
cf.
[Mzk3],
Remark
2.1.1].
As
in
§1,
we
shall
denote
the
(proﬁnite)
étale
fundamental
group
of
X
log
by
ΠX
.
Thus,
we
have
a
natural
exact
sequence:
1
→
ΔX
→
ΠX
→
GK
→
1
def
—
where
GK
=
Gal(K/K);
ΔX
is
deﬁned
so
as
to
make
the
sequence
exact.
Since
ΔX
is
a
proﬁnite
free
group
on
2
generators,
the
quotient
def
ΔΘ
X
=
ΔX
/[ΔX
,
[ΔX
,
ΔX
]]
ﬁts
into
a
natural
exact
sequence
ell
1
→
ΔΘ
→
ΔΘ
X
→
ΔX
→
1
def
ab
ell
2
—
where
Δell
X
=
ΔX
=
ΔX
/[ΔX
,
ΔX
];
we
write
ΔΘ
for
the
image
of
∧
ΔX
in
Θ
ΔΘ
X
.
Also,
we
shall
write
ΠX

ΠX
for
the
quotient
whose
kernel
is
the
kernel
of
the
quotient
ΔX

ΔΘ
X.
Now
let
l
≥
1
be
an
integer.
One
veriﬁes
easily
by
considering
the
well-known
Θ
structure
of
ΔΘ
X
that
the
subgroup
of
ΔX
generated
by
l-th
powers
of
elements
of
Θ
Θ
ΔΘ
X
is
normal.
We
shall
write
ΔX

ΔX
for
the
quotient
of
ΔX
by
this
normal
subgroup.
Thus,
the
above
exact
sequence
for
ΔΘ
X
determines
a
quotient
exact
sequence
ell
1
→
ΔΘ
→
Δ
X
→
Δ
X
→
1
ell
—
where
ΔΘ
∼
=
(Z/lZ)(1);
ΔX
is
a
free
(Z/lZ)-module
of
rank
2.
Also,
we
shall
write
ΠX

ΠX
for
the
quotient
whose
kernel
is
the
kernel
of
the
quotient
ΔX

ell
def
ΔX
and
ΠX
=
ΠX
/ΔΘ
.
Let
us
write
x
for
the
unique
cusp
of
X
log
.
Then
there
is
a
natural
injective
[outer]
homomorphism
Dx
→
ΠΘ
X
THE
ÉTALE
THETA
FUNCTION
33
—
where
Dx
⊆
ΠX
is
the
decomposition
group
associated
to
x
—
which
maps
the
inertia
group
Ix
⊆
Dx
isomorphically
onto
ΔΘ
.
Thus,
we
have
exact
sequences
1
→
ΔX
→
ΠX
→
GK
→
1;
1
→
ΔΘ
→
D
x
→
GK
→
1
—
where
we
write
D
x
⊆
ΠX
for
the
image
of
Dx
in
ΠX
.
ell
Next,
let
ΠX

Q
be
a
quotient
onto
a
free
(Z/lZ)-module
Q
of
rank
1
such
ell
that
the
restricted
map
ΔX
→
Q
is
still
surjective,
but
the
restricted
map
Dx
→
Q
is
trivial.
Denote
the
corresponding
covering
by
X
log
→
X
log
;
write
ΠX
⊆
ΠX
,
ell
ell
ΔX
⊆
ΔX
,
ΔX
⊆
ΔX
for
the
corresponding
open
subgroups.
Observe
that
our
assumption
that
the
restricted
map
Dx
→
Q
is
trivial
implies
that
every
cusp
of
X
log
is
K-rational.
Let
us
write
ι
(respectively,
ι)
for
the
automorphism
of
X
log
(respectively,
X
log
)
determined
by
“multiplication
by
−1”
on
the
underlying
elliptic
curve
relative
to
choosing
the
unique
cusp
of
X
log
(respectively,
relative
to
some
choice
of
a
cusp
of
X
log
)
as
the
origin.
Thus,
if
we
denote
the
stack-theoretic
quotient
of
X
log
(respectively,
X
log
)
by
the
action
of
ι
(respectively,
ι)
by
C
log
(respectively,
C
log
),
then
we
have
a
cartesian
commutative
diagram:
X

X

C

We
shall
write
ΠC
,
ΠC
for
the
respective
(proﬁnite)
étale
fundamental
groups
of
C
log
,
C
log
.
Thus,
we
obtain
subgroups
ΔC
⊆
ΠC
,
ΔC
⊆
ΠC
[i.e.,
the
kernels
of
the
natural
surjections
to
GK

moreover,
by
forming
the
quotient
by
the
kernels
of
the
quotients

we

Similarly,
the
quotient
ΔX

ΔX
determines
a
ell
quotient
ΔC

ΔC
.
Let
of
Gal(X/C)
∼
=
Z/2Z.
ι
∈
ΔC
be
an
element
that
lifts
the
nontrivial
element
Deﬁnition
2.1.
We
shall
refer
to
a
smooth
log
orbicurve
over
K
that
arises,
up
to

as
the
smooth

X

conell
structed
above
for

Q
as
being
of
type
(1,
l-tors)
(respectively,
(1,
l-tors)±
).
We
shall
also
apply
this
terminology
to
the
associated
hyperbolic
orbicurves.
Remark
2.1.1.
Note
that
although
X
log
→
X
log
is
[by
construction]
Galois,
with
Gal(X/X)
∼
=
Q,
the
covering
C
log
→
C
log
fails
to
be
Galois
in
general.
More
precisely,
no
nontrivial
automorphism
∈
Gal(X/X)
of,
say,
odd
order
descends
to
an
automorphism
of
C
log
over
C
log
.
Indeed,
this
follows
from
the
fact
that
ι
acts
on
Q
by
multiplication
by
−1.
34
Proposition
2.2.
Then:
SHINICHI

(The

Suppose
that
l
is
odd.
(i)
The
conjugation
action
of
ι
on
the

two
(Z/lZ)-module
ΔX
determines
a
direct
product
decomposition
ell
ΔX

ΔX
×
Δ
Θ
into
eigenspaces,
with
eigenvalues
−1
and
1,
respectively,
that
is
compatible
with
the
conjugation
action
of
ΠX
.
Denote
by
ell
s
ι
:
ΔX
→
Δ
X
ell
the
resulting
splitting
of
the
natural
surjection
ΔX

ΔX
.
(ii)
In
the
notation
of
(i),
the
normal
subgroup
Im(sι
)
⊆
ΠX
induces
an
isomorphism
∼
Dx
→
ΠX
/Im(sι
)
over
GK
.
In
particular,
any
section
of
the
H

(GK
,
ΔΘ
)
∼
=
K
×
/(K
×
)l
-torsor
of
splittings
of
Dx

GK
determines
a
covering
X
log
→
X
log
whose
corresponding
open
subgroup
we
denote
by
ΠX
⊆
ΠX
.
Here,
the
“geometric
ell
portion”
ΔX
of
ΠX
maps
isomorphically
onto
ΔX
[hence
is
a
cyclic
group
of
order
l],
i.e.,
we
have
ΔX
=
Im(sι
),
ΔX
=
ΔX
·
ΔΘ
.
Finally,
the
image
of
ι
in
ΔC
/ΔX
may
be
characterized
as
the
unique
coset
of
ΔC
/ΔX
that
lifts
the
nontrivial
element
of
Gal(X/C)
=
ΔC
/ΔX
and
normalizes
the
subgroup
ΔX
⊆
ΔC
.
(iii)
There
exists
a
unique
coset
∈
ΔC
/ΔX
such
that
ι
has
order
2
if
and
only
if
it
belongs
to
this
coset.
If
we
choose
ι
to
have
order
2,
then
the
open
subgroup
generated
by
ΠX
and
ι
in
ΠC
[or,
alternatively,
the
open
subgroup
generated
by
GK
∼
=
ΠX
/ΔX
and
ι
in
ΠC
/ΔX
]
determines
a
double
covering
X
log
→
C
log
which
ﬁts
into
a
cartesian
commutative
diagram
X
log
⏐
⏐

−→
X
log
⏐
⏐

C
log
−→
C

—
where
X
log
is
as
in
(ii).
Proof.
Assertions
(i)
and
(ii)
are
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions.
To
verify
assertion
(iii),
we
observe
that
Dx
∼
=
ΠX
/ΔX
is
of
index
2
in
ΠC
/ΔX
.
Thus,
ι
normalizes
Dx
∼
=
ΠX
/ΔX
.
Since,
moreover,
l
is
odd
[so
H

,
ΔΘ
),
ΔΘ

0
(GK
,
ΔΘ
)
THE

have
no
elements
of
order
2],
and
conjugation
by
ι
induces
the
identity
on
ΔΘ
and
GK
,
it
follows
that
ι
centralizes
Dx
∼
=
ΠX
/ΔX
,
hence
[a
fortiori]
GK
∼
=
ΠX
/ΔX
.
Now
assertion
(iii)
follows
immediately.
Remark
2.2.1.
We
shall
not
discuss
the
case
of
even
l
in
detail
here.
Nevertheless,
we
pause
brieﬂy
to
observe
that
if
l
=
2,
then
[since
ΔΘ
lies
in
the
center
of
ΔX
]
the
ell
automorphism
±
∈
Gal(Ẍ/C)
∼
=
ΔC
of
§1
acts
naturally
on
the
exact
sequence
ell
ell
1
→
ΔΘ
→
ΔX
→
ΔX
→
1.
Since
this
action
is
clearly
trivial
on
ΔΘ
,
ΔX
,
one
ell
veriﬁes
immediately
that
this
action
determines
a
homomorphism
ΔX
→
ΔΘ
,
i.e.,
in
eﬀect,
a
2-torsion
point
[so
long
as
the
homomorphism
is
nontrivial]
of
the
elliptic
curve
underlying
X
log
.
Thus,
by
considering
the
case
where
K
is
the
ﬁeld
of
moduli
of
this
elliptic
curve
[so
that
GK
permutes
the
2-torsion
points
transitively],
we
ell
conclude
that
this
homomorphism
must
be
trivial,
i.e.,
that
every
element
of
ΔX
admits
an
±
-invariant
lifting
to
ΔX
.
Deﬁnition
2.3.
We
shall
refer
to
a
smooth

orbicurve
over

arises,
up
to

as
the
smooth

in
Proposition
2.2
above
as
being
of

)
(respectively,

).
We
shall
also
apply
this
terminology
to
the
associated
hyperbolic
orbicurves.
Remark
2.3.1.
Thus,
one
may
think
of
the
“single
underline”
in
the
notation
X
log
,
C
log
as
denoting
the
result
of
“extracting
a
single

and
the
“double

in
the
notation
X

C

as
denoting
the
result
of
“extracting

an

Also,

the

A

similar
statement
holds
when
“Πtp

is
replaced
by
“Π”.
Proof.
The
proof
is
entirely
similar
to
the
proofs
of
Propositions
1.8,
2.4.
Remark
2.6.1.
Suppose,
for
simplicity,
that
K
contains
a
primitive
l-th
root
of
unity.
Then
we
observe
in
passing
that
by
applying
the
Propositions
2.4,
2.6
to
“isomorphisms
of
fundamental
groups
arising
from
isomorphisms
of
the
orbicurves
in
question”
[cf.
also
Remark
2.1.1],
one
computes
easily
that
the
groups
of
K-linear
automorphisms
“AutK
(−)”
of
the
various
smooth
log
orbicurves
under
consideration
are
given
as
follows:
AutK
(X

)
=
μl
×
{±1};
AutK
(X

=
Z/lZ

{±1}
AutK
(C

)
=
μl
;
AutK
(C

=
{1}
—
where
μl
denotes
the
group
of
l-th
roots
of
unity
in
K,
and
the
semi-direct
product
“”
is
with
respect
to
the
natural
multiplicative
action
of
±1
on
Z/lZ;
the
“AutK
(−)’s”
of
the
various
“once-dotted
versions”
of
these
orbicurves
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.5,
(ii)]
are
given
by
taken
the
direct
product
of
the
“AutK
(−)’s”
listed
above
with
Gal(Ċ
log
/C
log
)
∼
=
{±1}.
Next,
we
consider
étale
theta
functions.
First,
let
us
observe
that
the
covering
log
Ÿ
log
→
C
log
factors
naturally
through
Ẋ
.
Thus,
the
class
[which
is
only
well×
deﬁned
up
to
a
OK

η̈
Θ
∈
H

(Πtp

Ÿ
∼
/Πtp
of
§1
—
as
well
as
the
corresponding

—
may
be
thought
of
Ẋ
Ÿ
log
log
as
objects
associated
to
the
“Πtp
”
of
Ẋ
,
Ċ
,
X
log
,
C
log
.
On
the
other
hand,
the
composites
of
the
coverings
Ÿ
log
→
C
log
,
Y
log
→
C
log
with
C
log
→
C
log
determine
new
coverings
log
Ÿ

Ÿ

;
Y

→
Y
log
of
degree
l.
Moreover,
the
choice
of
a
splitting
of
D
x

GK
[cf.
Proposition
2.2,
(ii)]
that
determined
the
covering

[i.e.,

Now
it
is

that,

(Constant

For

=

let
us
assume
that
we
have
smooth

as
in

Then:

The

that

Suppose
further
that

that
the
residue

prime
to

and
that

Then
the

of
Theorem

determines
a

[i.e.,
without
any

indeterminacy].
Proof.
First,
let
us
recall
the
characteristic
nature
of
the
various
coverings
involved
[cf.
Propositions
2.4,
2.6].
Now
assertion
(i)
follows
immediately
from
Theorem
1.10,
(i),
and
the
deﬁnitions;
assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
Theorem
1.10,
(iii),
and
the
deﬁnitions;
assertion
(iii)
follows
immediately
from
Remark
1.9.1.
Before
proceeding,
we
pause
to
take
a
closer
look
at
the
cusps
of
the
various
smooth
log
orbicurves
under
consideration.
First,
we
recall
from
the
discussion
preceding
Lemma
1.2
that
the
irreducible
components
of
the
special
ﬁber
of
Ylog
may
be
assigned
labels
∈
Z,
in
a
natural
fashion.
These
labels
thus
determine
labels
∈
Z
for
the
cusps
of
Y
log
[i.e.,
by
considering
the
irreducible
component
of
the
special
ﬁber
of
Ylog
that
contains
the
closure
in
Y
of
the
cusp
in
question].
Moreover,
by
considering
the
covering
Ÿ
the
cusps
of
Ÿ
log
Ẋ
log
log
→
Y
log
,
we
thus
obtain
labels
∈
Z
for
.
Since
the
various
smooth
log
orbicurves
;
Ẋ
log
;
Ċ
log
;
Ċ
log
;
X
log
;
X
log
;
C
log
;
C
log
log
all
appear
as
subcoverings
of
the
covering
Ÿ
→
X
log
,
we
thus
obtain
labels
∈
Z
for
the
cusps
of
these
smooth
log
orbicurves,
which
are
well-deﬁned
up
to
a
certain
indeterminacy.
If
we
write
(Z/lZ)±
for
the
quotient
of
the
set
Z/lZ
by
the
natural
multiplicative
action
of
±1,
then
it
follows
immediately
from
the
construction
of
these
smooth
log
orbicurves
that
this
indeterminacy
is
such
that
the
labels
for
the
cusps
of
these
smooth
log
orbicurves
may
be
thought
of
as
well-deﬁned
elements
of
(Z/lZ)±
.
Corollary
2.9.
(Labels
of
Cusps)
Suppose
that
K
contains
a
primitive
l-th
root
of
unity.
Then
for
each
of
the
smooth
log
orbicurves
Ẋ
log
;
Ċ
log
;
Ċ
log
;
X
log
;
C
log
;
C
log
[as
deﬁned
in
the
above
discussion],
the
labels
of
the
above
discussion
determine
a
bijection
of
the
set
(Z/lZ)±
with
the
set
of
“AutK
(−)”-orbits
[cf.
Remark
2.6.1]
of
the
cusps
of
the
smooth
log
orbicurve.
Moreover,
in
the
case
of
X
log
,
C
log
,
and
C
log
,
these
bijections
are
preserved
by
arbitrary
isomorphisms
of
topological
groups
“γ”
as
in
Corollary
2.8.
Proof.
The
asserted
bijections
follow
immediately
by
tracing
through
the
definitions
of
the
various
smooth
log
orbicurves
[cf.
Remark
2.6.1].
With
regard
40
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
to
showing
that
these
bijections
are
preserved
by
“γ”
as
in
Corollary
2.8,
we
reduce
immediately
by
Proposition
2.4
to
the
case
of
C
log
;
in
this
case,
the
desired
preservation
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
the
labels
in
question
in
the
discussion
above,
together
with
the
fact
that
such
γ
always
preserve
the
dual
graphs
of
the
special
ﬁbers
of
the
orbicurves
in
question
[cf.
[Mzk2],
Lemma
2.3].
Remark
2.9.1.
We
observe
in
passing
that
a
bijection
as
in
Corollary
2.9
fails
to
log
hold
for
Ẋ
,
X
log
—
cf.
Remark
2.6.1.
Remark
2.9.2.
In
the
situation
of
Corollary
2.8,
(ii),
we
make
the
following
observation,
relative
to
the
labels
of
Corollary
2.9:
The

(respectively,

determined
by
the

permuted
transitively
by
the

of
AutK

(respectively,


))
[cf.
Remarks
2.1.1,
2.6.1,
2.9.1]
that
stabilizes
the
cusp.
In
the
case
of
log
X

,
at
cusps
with
nonzero
labels,
the
subgroup
of
the
corresponding
“AutK
(−)”
that
stabilizes
the
cusp
permutes
the
2l
trivializations
under
consideration
via
the
action
of
μl
[hence
has
precisely
two
orbits].
Next,
let
N

be
an
integer;
set
def
ΔμN
=
(Z/N
Z(1));
def

If

then
we

we

Observe
that

one

that

in

Next,
we
consider
assertion

It
is
immediate
from
the

the
factor
of
“1/l”
in
the
exponent
of
Ü
arises
from
the
fact
that
to
work
with
η̈
Θ,l·Z×μ2
amounts
to
working
with
l-th
roots
of
theta
functions
[cf.
the
discussion
preceding
Deﬁnition
2.7];
the
factor
of
“l”
arises
from
the
factor
of
l
in
“l
·
Z”.
Since,
moreover,
the
meromorphic
function
“Ü
2
”
on
Ÿ
descends
to
Y
,
we
thus
conclude
that
δ
extends
to
a
cocycle
of
Πtp
Y
with
coeﬃcients
in
μN
,
hence
that
α̈δ
extends
to
an
automorphism
αδ
∈
Aut(Πtp
Y
[μN
])
which
induces
the
identity
on
both
tp
the
quotient
Πtp
Y
[μN
]

ΠY
and
the
kernel
of
this
quotient.
Since
the
action
by
an
element
of
Gal(Y
/X)
clearly
maps
Ü
2
to
a
K
×
-multiple
of
Ü
2
,
it
thus
follows
that
conjugation
by
αδ
preserves
DY
⊆
Out(Πtp
Y
[μN
])
[cf.
the
deﬁnition
of
DY
!],
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Finally,
assertion
(iii)
follows
immediately
from
assertion
(ii)
in
the
mono-theta
case
by
considering
[in
the
context
of
assertion
(ii)]
the
action
of
an
arbitrary
element
of
l
·
Z.
In
the
bi-theta
case,
we
observe
that
if,
in
the
situation
of
assertion
(ii),
tΘ
Ÿ
is
obtained
as
an
N
·
(l
·
Z)-conjugate
of
sΘ
,
then
the
cocycle
δ
is
a
coboundary;
in
Ÿ
particular,
[in
this
case]
the
automorphism
αδ
preserves
the
μN
-conjugacy
classes
,

salg

the

follows
immediately
by
considering,
in

of

the
third
displayed
formula
of
Proposition
1.4,

applied

which
implies
[cf.

that

Remark

Note
that,
in

although
the
automorphism

extends
to
an

αδ
of

the

fails
to
extend

[i.e.,
since

to
descend
from

thus,
it
,

Remark
2.14.2.
Note
that
if,
in
the
situation
of
Proposition
2.14,
one
tries
to
replace
Gal(Y
/X)
by
Gal(Y
/C),
then
one
must
contend
with
the
“inversion
automorphism”
[cf.
Proposition
1.5,
(iii)],
which
maps
Ü
→
Ü
−1
.
This
obliges
one
—
if
one
is
to
retain
the
property
that
“conjugation

DY
”
—
[μN

that

of

On
the
other
hand,
if
one
enlarges
DY
in
this
fashion,
then
one
veriﬁes
easily
[cf.
the
description
of
the
Kummer
class
of
Ü
in
Proposition

that
the
subset

in
Proposition
2.14,
(ii)
—
cf.
also
the
mono-theta
portion
of
Proposition

(iii)
—
may
be
interpreted
as
the
“nonexistence

[cf.
the
discussion
preceding
Corollary

relative

On

the
description
of

already
suggests
that

on
this
point].
From
this
point
of
view,
Proposition
2.15,
(i),
(ii),
when
applied
to
mono-theta
environments
[cf.
Corollary
2.19,
(ii),
(iii),
below],
asserts,
in
eﬀect,
that:
If
one
works
with
this
projective
system
of
mono-theta
environments,
then
in
light
of
the
compatibility
of
the
various
[collections
of
subgroups
determined
by
the
image
of
the]
theta
sections
of
the
mono-theta
environments
in
the
projective
system,
the
various
mod
N
étale
theta
classes
determine,
in
the
projective
limit,
a
single
“discrete”

Z-torsor
THE

51
whose
reduction
modulo

[i.e.,

appears
in
the
mod
N
mono-theta
environment.
By
contrast,
Corollary
2.16
implies
that
if
one
tries
to
carry
out
such
a
construction
in
the
case
of
bi-theta
environments,
then
since
the
projective
system
in
question
gives
rise
to
a
“basepoint
indeterminacy”
[cf.
Proposition
2.14,
(iii)],
for
the

of
the
system,
given
by
some
group
lying

over
the
“non-discrete”

Put
another
way,
the
crucial
“shifting
symmetry”
that
exists
in
the
case
of
a
monotheta
environment
[cf.
Proposition
2.14,
(ii);
Remark
2.14.3]
gives
rise
to
a
“constant
[i.e.,
independent
of
N
]
l
·
Z-indeterminacy”,
hence
implies
precisely
that,
in
the
mono-theta
case,
the
problem
of
“ﬁnding
a
common
basepoint”
for
the
various
(l

Z/N
·
l
·
Z)-torsors
that
appear
in
the
projective
system
amounts
to
the
issue
of
trivializing
a
torsor
over
the
projective
limit
∼
lim
←−
(l
·
Z/l
·
Z)
=
{0}
N
—
which
remains
“discrete”
—
whereas
in
the
case
of
a
bi-theta
environment,
the
corresponding
torsor
is
a
torsor
over
the
projective
limit
∼

lim

(l

l

Z)
=
l
·
Z

—
which
is
“essentially
proﬁnite”,
hence,
in
particular,
“non-discrete”.
(ii)
Note
that
the
“non-discreteness”
discussed
in
(i),
which
arose
from
the
lack
of
symmetry
of
a
bi-theta
environment,
by
comparison
to
a
mono-theta
environment
[cf.
Proposition
2.14,
(iii)],
cannot
be
remedied
by,
for
instance,
considering
“multibi-theta
environments”
in
which
instead
of
considering
just
one
theta
section,
one
considers
an
entire
(l
·
Z/N
·
l
·
Z)-orbit
of
theta
sections.
Indeed,
if
one
considers
such
orbits,
then
the
resulting
projective
system
requires
one
to
consider
[not
an
l
·Z-orbit
of
an
étale
theta
function,
but
rather]
an
entire
orbit
over
the
non-discrete
proﬁnite
group
∼

lim
←−
(l
·
Z/N
·
l
·
Z)
=
l

Z
N
of
étale
theta
functions
—
i.e.,
one
must
contend
with
essentially
the
same
“nondiscreteness”
phenomenon
as
was
discussed
in
(i).
(iii)
The
“non-discreteness”
phenomenon
discussed
in
(i)
may
also
be
formulated
from
a
more
“cohomological”
point
of
view,
by
considering
the
ﬁrst
derived
lim
functor
R1
lim
←−
of
the
projective
limit
←
−.
That
is
to
say,
if
one
considers
the
exact
sequence
of
projective
systems
of
modules
{0
→
N
·
l
·
Z
→
l
·
Z
→

obtained
by
allowing
the

N
≥

to
vary
multiplicatively
[and
taking
the
transition
morphisms
to
be
the
morphisms
determined
by
identifying
the
various

of

then
the
[unique

homomorphism
of

essentially
equivalent
to
the
is
to
say,
the
nonvanishing

(l

“non-discreteness”
phenomenon
discussed
in
(i).
Remark
2.16.2.
Although
the
present
paper
is
essentially
only
concerned
with
the
“local
theory”
of
the
theta
function
[i.e.,
over
ﬁnite
extensions
of
Qp
],
frequently
in
applications
[cf.
[Mzk4],
[Mzk5]]
it
is
of
interest
to
develop
the
local
theory
in
such
a
way
that
it
may
be
related
naturally
to
the
“global
theory”
[i.e.,
over
number
ﬁelds].
In
such
situations,
one
is
typically
obligated
to
contend
with
some
sort
of
homomorphism
of
topological
groups
φ
:
Πtp
X
→
ΠX
F
relating
the
tempered
fundamental
group
of
the
smooth
log
curve
X
log
[appearing
in
the
theory
of
the
present
paper]
to
the
proﬁnite
fundamental
group
of
a
smooth
log
curve
X
log
over
a
number
ﬁeld
F
such
that
X
log
is
obtained
from
X
log
by
F
F
base-changing
to
some
completion
K
=
Fv
of
F
at
a
ﬁnite
prime
v.
Moreover,
typically,
one
must
assume
that
φ
is
only
given
up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
[i.e.,
as
an
“outer
homomorphism”].
Alternatively,
one
may
think
of
φ
“category-theoretically”
via
its
associated
morphism
of
temperoids
[cf.
[Mzk14],
Proposition
3.2]
T
→
TF
—
i.e.,
a
functor
TF
→
T
[obtained
by
associating
to
a
ΠX
-set
the
Πtp
X
-set
deterF
mined
by
composing
with
φ],
which
is
typically
only
determined
up
to
isomorphism.
In
this
situation,
connected
tempered
coverings
of
X
log
[e.g.,
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
Y
log
],
which
correspond
to
open
subgroups
H
⊆
Πtp
X
,
are
subject
to
an
indeterminacy
with
respect
to
conjugation
by
elements
of
the
normalizer
NΠX
(Im(H))
F
of
the
image
of
H
in
ΠX
—
i.e.,
as
opposed
to
just
the
“weaker”
indeterminacy
F
with
respect
to
conjugation
by
elements
of
the
normalizer
NΠtp
(H),
which
arises
X
from
working
with
the
topological
group
Πtp
X
up
to
inner
automorphism.
In
this
situation,
since
the
two
normalizers
in
question
in
fact
coincide
—
i.e.,
we
have
NΠtp
(H)
=
NΠX
(Im(H))
X
F
[by
Lemma
2.17,
(ii),
below;
the
well-known
fact
that
the
absolute
Galois
group
GFv
is
equal
to
its
own
normalizer
in
the
absolute
Galois
group
GF
—
cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk2],
THE
ÉTALE
THETA
FUNCTION
53
Theorem
1.1.1,
(i)]
—
in
the
present
situation,
this
state
of
aﬀairs
does
not
in
fact
result
in
any
further
indeterminacy
[by
comparison
to
the
strictly
local
situation].
Moreover,
the
above
equality
of
normalizers
also
shows
that
replacing
Πtp
X
by
H,
for
instance,
does
not
result
[in
the
present
local/global
situation]
in
any
reduction
in
the
indeterminacy
to
which
H
is
subject.
Thus,
when
H
corresponds
to
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
Y
log
,
the
corresponding
covering
will
always
be
subject
to
an
indeterminacy
with
respect
to
the
action
of
some
ﬁnite
index
subgroup
of
Z
[an
indeterminacy
which
results
in
the
sort
of
situation
discussed
in
Remark
2.16.1].
Thus,
in
summary:
The
indeterminacy
which
results
in
the
phenomena
discussed
in
Remark
2.16.1
may
be
regarded
as
the
inevitable
result
of
attempting
to
accommodate
simultaneously
the
“two
mutually
alien
copies
of
Z”
constituted
by
the
geometric
Galois
group
Z
and
the
arithmetic
global
base
Z
⊆
Q
⊆
F
.
[Here,
we
remark
that
the
“mutual
alienness”
of
these
two
copies
of
Z
arises
from
the
fact
that
[non-ﬁnite]
tempered
coverings
only
exist
p-adically,
hence
fail
to
descend
to
coverings
deﬁned
over
a
number
ﬁeld.]
Remark
2.16.3.
Relative
to
the
analogy
between
Galois
group
actions
and
diﬀerentials
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[Mzk4]],
the
equality
of
the
normalizers
discussed
in
Remark
2.16.2
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
group-theoretic
version
of
the
condition
that
the
map
from
a
ﬁnite
prime
of
a
number
ﬁeld
to
the
global
number
ﬁeld
be
“unramiﬁed”.

(Discrete

If

G2
,
then
write
NG2

the

Then:
(i)
Let

such
that

Write

Then
NΠ

Proof.
The
proof
of

(i)
is
similar
to
[but
slightly
more
involved
than]
the
proof
of
the
case

An

This
completes
the
proof
of

Assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
the
construction
of
the
model

in
the
discussion
preceding
Deﬁnition
2.13;
the
fact
that

that

is
precisely
the

of

Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
The
algorithm
for
constructing
the
quotient
Π

Π•Y
is
precisely
the
content
of
Proposition
2.11,
(ii);
the
construction
of
Π•X
then
follows
immediately,
in
light
of
the
temp-slimness
of
Π•X
[cf.
the
proof
of
Proposition
2.11].
The
ﬁnal
portion
of
assertion
(iii)
[concerning
the
compatibility
with
the
algorithm
of

(ii)]
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
a
mono-theta
environment
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.13,
(ii)]
as
“data
isomorphic
to
a

mono-theta

[together
with
the
description
given
in
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii)
of
the
algorithm
of
assertion
(ii)].
•
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iv).
First,
we
observe
that
the
functoriality
of
the
“functorial
group-theoretic
algorithm”
of
assertion
(iii)
yields
a
natural
map
β
Isomμ
(Mα
,
Mβ
)
→
Isom(Πα
X
,
ΠX
).
The
surjectivity
of
this
map
follows
by
applying
the
“functorial
group-theoretic
algorithm”
of
assertion
(ii),
in
light
of
the
ﬁnal
portion
of
assertion
(iii)
concerning
the
relation
with
the
algorithm
of
assertion
(ii)
[cf.,
especially,
the
fact
that
the
isomorphism
of
mono-theta
environments
appearing
in
this
ﬁnal
portion
induces
the
identity
on
“Π•Y
”].
The
ﬁbers
of
this
map
are
torsors
over
[the
isomorphic
groups]
Ker(Autμ
(M
)
→
Aut(Π
X
))
[where

∈
{α,
β}].
To
def
simplify
notation,
let
us
set
M•
=
M
.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
by
Corollary
2.19,
(i),
below
[where
one
checks
immediately
that
there
are
no
“vicious
circles”
in
the
reasoning],
the
natural
isomorphism
∼
(l
·
Δ•Θ
)
⊗
Z/N
Z
→
Ker(Π•

Π•Y
)
is
preserved
by
automorphisms
of
M•
.
Thus,
Ker(Autμ
(M•
)
→
Aut(Π•X
))
—
which
consists
of
automorphisms
that
act
as
the
identity
on
Π•Y
,
hence
[by
applying
the
above
natural
isomorphism]
also
on
Ker(Π•

Π•Y
)
—
is
naturally
isomorphic
to
the
group
Hom(Π•Y
/Π•Ÿ
,
Ker(Π•

Π•Y
))
—
which
is
of
cardinality
1
(respectively,
2)
if
N
is
odd
(respectively,
even).
Moreover,
it
follows
immediately
from
this
description
of
Ker(Autμ
(M•
)
→
Aut(Π•X
))
that
the
natural
homomorphism
Autμ
(M•
)

Autμ
(M•M
)
is
as
described
in
the
statement
of
assertion
(iv).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iv).
Remark
2.18.1.
It
follows
immediately
from
Proposition
2.14,
(iii),
that,
for
instance,
the
bijectivity
[i.e.,
“if
N/M
is
odd”]
of
the
latter
portion
of
Corollary
2.18,
(iv),
is
false
for
bi-theta
environments.
Remark
2.18.2.
Thus,
in
a
word,
Corollary
2.18
may
be
interpreted
as
asserting
that
a
mono-theta
environment
may
be
regarded
as
an
object
naturally
constructed
from/associated
to
the
tempered
fundamental
group.
On
the
other
hand,
as
we
shall
58
SHINICHI

see
in
§5,
a
mono-theta
environment
also
appears
as
an
object
this
may
be
naturally
constructed
from/associated
to
a
certain
Frobenioid.
In
fact:
One
of
the
main
motivating
reasons,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
author,
for
the
introduction
of
the
notion
of
a
mono-theta
environment
was
precisely
the
fact
that
it
provides
a
convenient
common
ground
for
relating
the
[tempered-]étale-theoretic
and
Frobenioid-theoretic
approaches
to
the
theta
function.
This
point
of
view
will
be
discussed
in
more
detail
in
Remark
5.10.1
in
§5
below.

we
obtain
a
topological
group

from
M•
to

Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
Observe
that
since
the
theta
and
algebraic
[i.e.,
“tautological”]
sections
coincide
over
Ker(Π•Y

(Π•Y
)Θ
)
[cf.
Proposition
1.3],
it
follows
that
Ker(Π•

Π•
|(Π•Y

)
may
be
constructed
as
the
image
via
the
theta
section
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.13,
(ii),
(c)]
of
Ker(Π•Y

(Π•Y
)Θ
).
The
subquotients
Π•
|(l·Δ•Θ
)
⊆
Π•
|(Δ•Y
)Θ
⊆
Π•
|(Π•Y
)Θ
may
then
be
constructed
as
the
inverse
images
via
the
resulting
quotient
Π•
|(Π•Y


(Π•Y

of
the
subquotients
(l

Δ•Θ
)
⊆
(Δ•Y
)Θ
⊆
(Π•Y

of
Corollary
2.18,
(i).
The
splitting
of
the
natural
surjection
Π•
|(l·Δ•Θ
)

(l
·
Δ•Θ
)
corresponding
to
the
theta
section
may
then
be
obtained
directly
from
the
“theta
section
portion”
of
the
data
that
constitutes
a
mono-theta
environment
[cf.
Definition
2.13,
(ii),
(c)];
the
splitting
corresponding
to
the
algebraic
section
[i.e.,
the
“tautological
section”]
may
then
be
constructed
via
the
algorithm
described
in
Proposition
2.14,
(i).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
Corollary
2.18,
(iv).
Here,
relative
to
the
point
of
view
of
Remark
2.16.1,
(iii),
we
note
that
assertion
(ii)
may
be
thought
of
as
a
consequence
of
the
fact
that
[as
is
easily
veriﬁed]
the
“R1
lim
←−’s”
of
the
projective
system
“{Hom(Z/2Z,
Z/N
Z)}N∈E
”
of
Corollary
2.18,
(iv),
as
well
as
the
projective
system
“{μN
}N∈E
”
[cf.
the
superscripted
“μ’s”
of
Corollary
2.18,
(iv)],
vanish.
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
An
algorithm
for
constructing
the
étale
theta
function
of
standard
type
is
described
in
the
proofs
of
Theorems
1.6,
1.10;
Corollary
2.8,
(i)
[cf.
also
the
proof
of
[Mzk14],
Theorem
6.8,
(iii)].
[Here,
we
recall
in
passing
that
this
“algorithm”
consists
essentially
of
restricting
[candidates
for]
the
étale
theta
function
to
the
decomposition
groups
of
certain
torsion
points.]
The
remainder
of
assertion
(iii)
follows,
in
light
of
the
cyclotomic
rigidity
of
assertion
(i)
and
the
discrete
rigidity
of
assertion
(ii),
from
the
construction
of
the
model
bi-theta
environment
in
the
discussion
preceding
Deﬁnition
2.13.
Remark
2.19.1.
One
way
to
try
to
eliminate
the
indeterminacy
discussed
in
Remarks
2.16.1,
2.16.2
is
to
attempt
to
work
with
proﬁnite
coverings
of
X
log
that
correspond
to
the
covering
X
log
→
X
log
for
“l
inﬁnite”.
On
the
other
hand,
such
coverings
amount
to
taking
N
-th
roots
[for
all
integers
N
≥
1]
of
the
theta
function.
In
particular,
when
N
is
a
power
of
p,
this
has
the
eﬀect
of
annihilating
the
diﬀerentials
of
the
curve
under
consideration.
Since
the
diﬀerentials
of
the
curve
play
an
essential
role
in
the
proof
of
the
main
result
of
[Mzk11],
it
thus
seems
unrealistic
[at
least
at
the
time
of
writing]
to
expect
to
generalize
the
main
result
of
[Mzk11]
[hence
also
the
theory
of
§1,
which
depends
on
this
result
of
[Mzk11]
in
an
essential
way]
so
as
to
apply
to
such
proﬁnite
coverings.
THE
ÉTALE
THETA
FUNCTION
61
Remark
2.19.2.
The
“cyclotomic
rigidity”
of
Corollary
2.19,
(i),
is
a
consequence
of
the
theta
section
portion
of
the
data
that
constitutes
a
mono-theta
environment
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.13,
(ii),
(c)],
together
with
the
subtle
property
of
the
commutator
[−,
−]
discussed
in
Proposition
2.12
[which
takes
the
place
of
the
algebraic
section,
an
object
which
does
not
appear
in
a
mono-theta
environment].
Note
that
this
subtle
property
depends
in
an
essential
way
on
the
fact
that
the
étale
theta
class
in
question
determines
an
isomorphism
between
the
subquotient
ΔΘ
of
the
tempered
fundamental
group
and
the
cyclotomic
coeﬃcients
under
consideration
[cf.
Proposition
1.3].
In
particular:
This
subtle
property
fails
to
hold
if
instead
of
considering
η̈
Θ,l·Z×μ2
over
log
Ÿ
—
i.e.,
the
ﬁrst
power
of
an
l-th
root
of
the
theta
function
[cf.
the
discussion
preceding
Deﬁnition
2.7]
—
one
attempts
to
use
some
M
-th
power
of
the
l-th
root
of
the
theta
function
for
M
>
1.
Put
another
way,
if
one
tries
to
work
with
such
an
M
-th
power,
where
M
>
1,
then
one
ends
up
only
being
able
to
assert
the
desired
“cyclotomic
rigidity”
for
the
submodule
M
·μN
⊆
μN
[for,
say,
N
divisible
by
M
];
that
is
to
say,
the
“remainder”
of
μN
is
not
rigid,
but
rather
subject
to
an
indeterminacy
with
respect
to
the
action
of
Ker((Z/N
Z)×

(Z/(N/M
)Z)×
).
Alternatively,
if,
instead
of
working
with

torsion
coeﬃcients
[i.e.,
μN
]
one
works
with
Z-ﬂat
coeﬃcients
[e.g.,
the
inverse
limit
of
the
μN
,
as
N
ranges
over
the
integers
≥
1],
then
one
may
still
obtain
the

[Z-ﬂat
analogue
of
the]
desired
“cyclotomic
rigidity”
property
of
Corollary
2.19,
(i),
for
M
>
1,
but
only
at
the
cost
of
working
with
“proﬁnite
coverings”
whose
ﬁnite
subcoverings
are
“immune”
to
automorphism
indeterminacy,
which
[cf.
Corollary
5.12
and
the
following
remarks
in
§5
below]
appears
to
be
somewhat
unnatural.
Remark
2.19.3.
In
the
context
of
the
projective
systems
discussed
in
Corollary
2.19,
(ii),
(iii),
if
one
writes
Δ[μ∞
]
for
the
inverse
limit
of
the
Δ[μN
]
[as
N
ranges
over
the
integers
≥
1],
then
one
may
think
of
the
isomorphism
∼
(l
·
ΔΘ
)
→
Δ[μ∞
]
arising
from
the
“cyclotomic
rigidity”
[i.e.,
the
compatible
isomorphisms
of
cyclotomes]
of
Corollary
2.19,
(i),
as
determining
a
sort
of
“integral
structure”,
i.e.,
a
sort
of
“basepoint”
corresponding
to
the
ﬁrst
power
of
the
l-th
root
of
the
theta
function,
relative
to
the
various
M
-th
powers
of
the
l-th
root
of
the
theta
function
[cf.
Remark
2.19.2]
obtained
by
composing
this
isomorphism
with
the
map
Δ[μ∞
]
→
Δ[μ∞
]
on
Δ[μ∞
]
given
by
multiplication
by
M
.
Put
another
way:
To
work
in
the
absence
of
such
a
“basepoint”
amounts
to
sacriﬁcing
the
datum
of
an
intrisically
deﬁned
“origin”,
or
“ﬁxed
reference
point”,
in
the
system

obtained

Put
another
way,
there
is
no
intrinsic
way
to
distinguish
“Δ[μ∞
]
”
from
“M
·
Δ[μ∞
]
”
—
i.e.,
the
distinction
between
these
two
objects
is
entirely
a
matter
of
“arbitrary
labels”
[which
are
typically
implicit
in
classical
discussions
of
arithmetic
geometry
—
cf.
the
discussion
of
the
Introduction
to
the
present
paper].
Remark
2.19.4.
Before
proceeding,
it
is
natural
to
pause
and
reﬂect
on
the
topic
of
precisely
what
one
gains
from
the
discrete
and
cyclotomic
rigidity
of
Corollary
2.19,
(i),
(ii).
On
the
one
hand,
discrete
rigidity
assures
one
that,
when
one
works
with
the
projective
systems
discussed
in
Corollary
2.19,
(ii),
(iii),
one
may
restrict
to
the
Z-translates
of
[an
l-th
root
of]
the
theta
function
without
having
to
worry

which
are
“unnatural”.
At
the
level
of
about
confusion
with
arbitrary
Z-translates,
theta
values
[cf.,
e.g.,
Proposition
1.4,
(iii);
the
labels
of
Corollary
2.9],
this
means
that
one
obtains
values
in
K
×
,
as
opposed
to
(K
×
)∧
;
in
particular,
it
makes
sense
to
perform
[not
just
multiplication
operations,
but
also]
addition
operations
involving
these
values
in
K
×
⊆
K,
which
is
not
possible
with
arbitrary
elements
of
(K
×
)∧
.
On
the
other
hand,
cyclotomic
rigidity
assures
one
that
one
may
work
with
the
ﬁrst
power
of
[an
l-th
root
of]
the
theta
function
without
having
to
worry
that
this

×
.
At
ﬁrst
power
might
be
“confused
with
some
arbitrary
λ-th
power”,
for
λ
∈
Z
the
level
of
theta
values
[cf.,
e.g.,
Proposition
1.4,
(iii);
the
labels
of
Corollary
2.9],
this
means
that
one
need
not
worry
about
confusion
between
the
“original
desired
values”
in
K
×
⊆
(K
×
)∧
and
arbitrary
λ-th
powers
of
such
values
in
(K
×
)∧
,
for

×
—
where
again
it
is
useful
to
recall
that
raising
to
the
λ-th
power
on
(K
×
)∧
λ∈Z

×
]
is
not
a
ring
homomorphism
[i.e.,
not
compatible
with
addition]
unless
[for
λ
∈
Z
λ
=
1.
Remark
2.19.5.
Recall
that
in
the
proof
of
[Mzk13],
Theorem
4.3
[cf.
especially
the
proof
of
[Mzk2],
Lemma
2.5,
(ii)],
one
ﬁnds
a
“group-theoretic
algorithm”
for
constructing
a
certain
natural
isomorphism
of
cyclotomes,
between
one
cyclotome
of
geometric
origin
—
which,
in
the
situation
of
Corollaries
2.18,
2.19,
essentially
amounts
to
(l
·
ΔΘ
)
—
and
one
cyclotome
of
arithmetic
origin
—
which,
in
the
situation
of
Corollaries
2.18,
2.19,
arises
from
GK
.
If
one
combines
this
isomorphism
of
cyclotomes
with
the
isomorphism
of
cyclotomes
given
in
Corollary
2.19,
(i),
the
resulting
“two-layer
isomorphism
of
cyclotomes
structure”
is
reminiscent
of
the
“Griﬃths
semi-transversality”
of
the
“crystalline
theta
object”
in
the
HodgeArakelov
theory
of
elliptic
curves
[cf.
[Mzk5],
Theorem
2.8],
which
arises
from
the
“two-layer
deformation”
that
occurs
in
the
consideration
of
the
“crystalline
theta
object”
[i.e.,
a
deformation
of
the
elliptic
curve,
together
with
a
deformation
of
an
ample
line
bundle
on
the
deformed
elliptic
curve].
THE
ÉTALE
THETA
FUNCTION
63
Section
3:
Tempered
Frobenioids
In
the
present
§3,
we
construct
certain
Frobenioids
[cf.
the
theory
of
[Mzk17],
[Mzk18]]
arising
from
the
geometry
of
line
bundles
on
tempered
coverings
of
a
p-adic
curve.
After
discussing
various
basic
properties
of
these
“tempered
Frobenioids”
[cf.
Theorem
3.7;
Corollary
3.8],
we
explain
how
certain
aspects
of
the
theory
of
the
étale
theta
function
discussed
in
§1,
§2
may
be
interpreted
from
the
point
of
view
of
tempered
Frobenioids
[cf.
Example
3.9].
Let
L
be
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
[where
p
is
a
prime
number],
with
ring
of
integers
OL
and
residue
ﬁeld
kL
;
T
the
formal
scheme
given
by
the
p-adic
completion
of
Spec(OL
);
Tlog
the
formal
log
scheme
obtained
by
equipping
T
with
the
log
structure
determined
by
the
unique
closed
point
of
Spec(OL
);
Zlog
a
stable
log
curve
over
Tlog
.
Also,
we
assume
that
the
special
ﬁber
ZkL
of
Z
is
split,
and
that
the
generic
def
ﬁber
of
the
algebrization
of
Zlog
is
a
smooth
log
curve.
Write
Z
log
=
Zlog
×OL
L
for
the
ringed
space
with
log
structure
obtained
by
tensoring
the
structure
sheaf
of
Z
over
OL
with
L.
In
the
following
discussion,
we
shall
often
[by
abuse
of
notation]
use
the
notation
Z
log
also
to
denote
the
generic
ﬁber
of
the
algebrization
of
Zlog
[cf.
§1].
log
deterThe
universal
covering
of
the

of
the

étale
covering

of

such

appear
in
the
theory
of
the
tempered
fundamental
group
[cf.
[André],
§4;
[Mzk14],
Example
3.10].
Thus,
Zlog
∞
is
a
def
log
formal
log
scheme;
write
Z∞
=
Zlog
∞
×OL
L.
Also,
we
shall
refer
to
the
inverse
log
image
of
the
divisor
of
cusps
of
Zlog
in
Zlog

as
the
divisor
of
cusps
of
Z∞
and
to

Zlog

as
the

of

.

(iii)
Let
f
be
a
nonzero
meromorphic
function
on
Z∞
such
that
for
every
N
N
∈
N≥1
[cf.
§0],
there
exists
a
meromorphic
function
gN
on
Z∞
such
that
gN
=
f.
Then
f
=
1.
Proof.
To
verify
assertion
(i),
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
the
completion
of
Z∞
along
a
node
of
Z∞
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
formal
spectrum
of
a
complete
local
ring
of
e
the
form
OL
[[x,
y]]/(xy
−
πL
),
where
πL
is
a
uniformizer
of
OL
,
and
e
is
a
positive
integer;
moreover,
despite
the
“inﬁnite”
nature
of
Z∞
,
the
number
of
“e’s”
that
occur
at
completions
of
Z∞
along
its
nodes
is
ﬁnite
[cf.
the
deﬁnition
of
Zlog
∞
in
log
terms
of
Z
!].
Now
assertion
(i)
follows
from
the
fact
that
the
two
irreducible
components
of
the
special
ﬁber
of
this
formal
spectrum
determine
divisors
D,
E
such
that
e
·
D,
e
·
E
are
Cartier
[i.e.,
since
they
occur
as
the
schematic
zero
loci
of
“x”,
“y”].
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
Let
0
=
f
∈
Γ(Z∞
,
OZ∞
);
write
V
(f
)
for
the
schematic
zero
locus
of
f
on
Z∞
.
Now
observe
that
for
each
irreducible
component
C
of
(Z∞
)kL
,
there
exists
an
eC
∈
Z≥0
such
that
the
meromorphic
function
−eC
f
·
πL
—
where
πL
is
a
uniformizer
of
OL
—
has
no
zeroes
or
poles
at
the
generic
point
of
C.
By
the
discrete
structure
of
Z≥0
,
it
follows
that
there
exists
an
irreducible
component
C1
such
that
eC1
≤
eC
,
for
all
irreducible
components
C
of
(Z∞
)kL
.
def
−e
Thus,
the
meromorphic
function
f1
=
f
·
πL
C1
is
regular,
i.e.,
f1
∈
Γ(Z∞
,
OZ∞
),
and,
moreover,
has
nonzero
restriction
to
(Z∞
)kL
.
On
the
other
hand,
since
(Z∞
)kL
is
connected
and
reduced,
and
each
irreducible
component
C
of
(Z∞
)kL
is
proper
and
geometrically
integral
over
kL
[since
we
assumed
that
ZkL
of
Z
is
split],
it

applying
the
p-adic
completeness
of
Z∞
,
we
conclude
that
f

as
desired.
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
Since
Z∞
is
locally
noetherian,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
existence
of
the
gN
that
the
divisor
of
zeroes
and
poles
of
f
×
.
Since
L
is
a
ﬁnite
extension
is
0,
hence,
by
assertion
(ii),
that
f
is
a
constant
∈
OL
×
of
Qp
,
it
thus
follows
from
the
well-known
structure
of
OL
that

i.e.,
that

as

Next,
let

be
a
ﬁnite

of
Qp

with

OK
and

of

is
a

Write

Thus,
if

the

Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
Let
M
be
one
of
the
monoids
under
consideration.
The
fact
that
M
is
divisorial
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions.
The
fact
that
M
is
perf-factorial
then
follows
immediately
from
Proposition
3.2,
(i)
[cf.
also
the
description
of
the
primes
of
M
in
terms
of
“orbits
of
prime
log-divisors”
given
in
Remark
3.3.1].
Now
let
α
be
an
endomorphism
of
M
that
is
induced
by
an
endomorphism
of
Y
log
over
X
log
such
that
α
induces
the
identity
endomorphism
on
the
set
of
primes
of
M
.
Then
by
considering
local
functions
on
Z∞
that
arise
from
local
functions
on
X
and
vanish
at
various
primes
of
M
,
it
follows
that
α
is
the
identity,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
Proposition
3.2,
(ii)
[and
the
deﬁnitions].
Lemma
3.5.
(Perfections
and
Realiﬁcations
of
Perf-factorial
Submonoids)
Let
P
,
Q
be
perf-factorial
monoids
such
that:
(a)
P
is
a
submonoid
of
Q;
(b)
P
is
group-saturated
[cf.
§0]
in
Q;
(c)
R
supports
Q
[cf.
[Mzk17],
Deﬁnition
2.4,
(ii)].
Then:
(i)
The
inclusion
P
→
Q
extends
uniquely
to
inclusions
P
pf
→
Q,
P
rlf
→
Q.
(ii)
Relative
to
the
inclusions
of
(i),
P
pf
,
P
rlf
are
group-saturated
in
Q.
Proof.
Indeed,
the
portion
of
assertions
(i),
(ii)
involving
“P
pf
”
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions.
Next,
let
p
∈
Prime(P
)
[where
“Prime(−)”
is
as
in
[Mzk17],
§0].
Since
P
is
perf-factorial,
it
follows
that
the
“primary
component”
Pp
associated
to
p
is
isomorphic
to
Z≥0
,
Q≥0
,
or
R≥0
[cf.
[Mzk17],
Deﬁnition
2.4,
(i),
(b)].
Since
R≥0
acts
on
Q
[cf.
condition
(c)],
it
thus
follows
that
the
natural
homomorphism
of
monoids
Pp
→
P
→
Q
extends
[uniquely]
to
a
homomorphism
of
monoids
Pprlf
→
Q.
Next,
observe
that
it
follows
from
the
deﬁnition
of
the
realiﬁcation
[cf.
[Mzk17],
Deﬁnition
2.4,
(i)]
that
for
every
a
∈
P
rlf
,
there
exists
an
a
∈
P
pf
such
that
a
≥
a.
In
particular,
it
follows
that
for
each
q
∈
Prime(Q),
the
sum
of
the
images
of
the
various
“primary
components
ap
∈
Pp
of
a”
[as
p
ranges
over
the
elements
of
Prime(P
)]
in
Qq
∼
=
R≥0
is
bounded
above
[i.e.,
by
the
image
in

R
Qq
∼
of
a
,
which
is
well-deﬁned
since
a
∈
P
pf
].
Thus,
this
sum
converges
to
=
≥0
an
element
of
Qq
∼
=
R≥0
.
Now,
letting
q
range
over
the
elements
of
Prime(Q),
we
conclude
that
we
obtain
a
homomorphism
of
monoids
rlf
P
rlf
→
Qpf
factor
=
Qfactor
[relative
to
the
notation
of
[Mzk17],
Deﬁnition
2.4,
(i),
(c)].
Since,
moreover,
Q
is
perf-factorial,
it
follows
from
[Mzk17],
Deﬁnition
2.4,
(i),
(d)
[together

existence
of
an
a
∈
P
pf
such
that

a],
that
this
homomorphism
factors
through
Q,
hence
determines
a
homomorphism
of
monoids
φ
:
P
rlf
→
Q
that
is
[easily
veriﬁed
to
be]
uniquely
characterized
by
the
property
that
it
extends
the
natural
homomorphism
of
monoids
P
pf
→
Q.
Write
φgp
:
(P
rlf
)gp
→
Qgp
for
the
induced
homomorphism
on
groupiﬁcations.
Next,
let
a,
b
∈
P
rlf
be
such
that
φgp
(a
−
b)
≥
0
[i.e.,
φgp
(a
−
b)
∈
Q].
Then
for
any
a
,
b
∈
P
pf
such
that
a
≥
a,
b
≤
b,
we
obtain
that
φgp
(a
−
b
)
≥
φgp
(a
−
b)
≥
0,
hence
[by
the
portion
of
assertion
(ii)
concerning
“P
pf
”]
that
a
≥
b
.
On
the
other
hand,
since
P
is
perffactorial
[cf.
[Mzk17],
Deﬁnition
2.4,
(i),
(d)],
it
follows
immediately
that
if
a
≥
b,
then
there
exist
a
,
b
∈
P
pf
(A)
such
that
a
≥
a,
b
≤
b,
a
≥
b
.
Thus,
we
conclude
that
a
≥
b.
In
particular,
if
φgp
(a
−
b)
=
0,
then
it
follows
that
there
exists
a
def
c
∈
P
rlf
[i.e.,
c
=
a
−
b]
such
that
φ(c)
=
0.
On
the
other
hand,
if
c
=
0,
then
[cf.
[Mzk17],
Deﬁnition
2.4,
(i),
(d)]
there
exists
a
c
∈
P
pf
such
that
0
<
c
≤
c,
hence
that
0
≤
φ(c
)
≤
0,
so
φ(c
)
=
0,
in
contradiction
to
the
injectivity
of
the
natural
homomorphism
of
monoids
P
pf
→
Q.
Thus,
we
conclude
that
φ
is
injective.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
portion
of
assertions
(i),
(ii)
involving
“P
rlf
”.

that
it

Moreover,
the

determines
a

which
may
be
applied
to
think
of
C

as
a

Note
that
it

immediately
from
the
existence
of

that
C
bs-ﬂd
is
a
p-adic

have

for

Remark
3.6.1.
Note
that
the
group-saturated-ness
hypothesis
of
Deﬁnition
3.6,
(ii),
may
be
regarded
as
the
condition
that
“divisors
relative
to
Φ
are
eﬀective
if
and
only
if
they
are
eﬀective
relative
to
ΦR-log
,
i.e.,
if
and
only
if
they
are
eﬀective
in
the
usual
sense”.
Alternatively,
this
hypothesis
[together
with
the
perf-factoriality
hypothesis
of
Deﬁnition
3.6,
(ii)]
may
be
regarded
as
the
analogue
in
the
present
“tempered
context”
of
the
monoprime-ness
hypothesis
in
[Mzk18],
Example
1.1,
(ii)
—
cf.
Remark
3.5.1.
Remark
3.6.2.
Observe
that
the
base-ﬁeld-theoretic
hull
of
Deﬁnition
3.6,
(iv),
is
itself
a
tempered
Frobenioid,
and,
moreover,
that
every
p-adic
Frobenioid
may
be
obtained
in
this
way
[cf.
Remarks
3.5.1,
3.6.1].
In
particular,
it
follows
that
“the
notion
of
a
p-adic
Frobenioid
is
a
special
case
of
the
notion
of
a
tempered
Frobenioid”.
Also,
we
observe
in
passing
that
Φbs-ﬂd
is
always
non-dilating
and
strictly
rational.
Remark
3.6.3.
It
follows
immediately
from
Proposition
3.4,
(ii),
and
the
explicit
divisorial
description
of
objects
and
morphisms
of
a
model
Frobenioid
given
in
[Mzk17],
Theorem
5.2,
(i)
[cf.
also
the
equivalences
of
categories
of
[Mzk17],
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d),
determined
by
the
operation
of
taking
the
zero
divisor
of
a
co-angular
pre-step]
that
the
objects
of
the
essential
image
[cf.
§0]
of
the
natural
functor
C
bs-ﬂd
→
C
may
be
described
as
the
objects
of
C
that
may
be
“linked”
to
a
Frobenius-trivial
object
via
base-ﬁeld
theoretic
pre-steps,
while
the
morphisms
of
the
essential
image
of
the
natural
functor
C
bs-ﬂd
→
C
may
be
described
as
the
base-ﬁeld
theoretic
morphisms
of
C
between
objects
of
the
essential
image
of
C
bs-ﬂd
→
C.
In
particular,
the
natural
functor
C
bs-ﬂd
→
C
is
isomorphism-full
[cf.
§0].
Thus,
no
confusion
arises
from
“identifying”
C
bs-ﬂd
with
its
essential
image
via
the
natural
functor
C
bs-ﬂd
→
C
in
C
[cf.
§0].
Remark
3.6.4.
If
Φ,
C
are
as
in
Deﬁnition
3.6,
(ii),
then
it
follows
from
Lemma
3.5
[applied
to
the
submonoid
Φ
⊆
ΦR-log
]
that
the
respective
divisor
monoids
72
SHINICHI

Φpf
,
Φrlf
of
C
pf
,
C
rlf
also
satisfy
the
conditions
of
Deﬁnition
3.6,
(ii).
That
is
to
say,
the
perfection
and
realiﬁcation
of
a
tempered
Frobenioids
are
again
tempered
Frobenioids.
Remark
3.6.5.
One
veriﬁes
immediately
that,
when
applied
to
a
tempered
Frobenioid,
the
operations
of
perfection
and
realiﬁcation
[cf.
Remark
3.6.4]
are
compatible
with
the
operation
of
passing
to
the
associated
base-ﬁeld-theoretic
hull
of
the
tempered
Frobenioid.
Remark
3.6.6.
In
the
situation
of
Deﬁnition
3.6,
(ii),
if
one
supposes
further
that
Φ
is
perfect,
then
condition
(a)
follows
from
condition
(b)
[or,
alternatively,
from
the
condition
that
Φbs-ﬂd
(A)
be
nonzero
for
each
A
∈
Ob(D)].
Indeed,
this
follows
immediately
by
applying
the
factorization
homomorphism
of
[Mzk17],
Deﬁnition
2.4,
(i),
(c)
[cf.
also
[Mzk17],
Deﬁnition
2.4,
(i),
(d)],
associated
to
the
perf-factorial
monoid
Φ(A).
Now
we
have
the
following
“tempered
analogue”
of
[Mzk18],
Theorem
1.2:
Theorem
3.7.
(Basic
Properties
of
Tempered
Frobenioids)
In
the
notation
of
Deﬁnition
3.6:
(i)
If
Λ
=
Z
(respectively,
Λ
=
R),
then
C
is
of
unit-proﬁnite
(respectively,
unit-trivial)
type.
For
arbitrary
Λ,
the
Frobenioid
C
is
of
isotropic,
model
[hence,
in
particular,
birationally
Frobenius-normalized],
and
subquasi-Frobenius-trivial
type,
but
not
of
group-like
type.
(ii)
Suppose
D
is
of
FSMFF-type,
and
that
Φ
is
non-dilating.
Then
C
is
of
standard
type.
If,
moreover,
Φ
is
rational
[cf.
Deﬁnition
3.6,
(ii)],
then
C
is
of
rationally
standard
type.
def
(iii)
Let
A
∈
Ob(C);
AD
=
Base(A)
∈
Ob(D).
Write
Acnst
∈
Ob(Dcnst
)
for
the
image
of
AD
in
Dcnst
[cf.
the
discussion
preceding
Deﬁnition
3.3].
Then
the
natural
action
of
AutC
(A)
on
O
(A),
O×
(A)
factors
through
AutDcnst
(Acnst
).
If,
moreover,
Λ
∈
{Z,
Q},
then
this
factorization
determines
a
faithful
action
of
the
image
of
AutC
(A)
in
AutDcnst
(Acnst
)
on
O
(A),
O×
(A).
(iv)
If
D
is
slim
[cf.
[Mzk17],
§0],
and
Λ
∈
{Z,
R},
then
C
is
also
slim.
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
In
light
of
the
deﬁnition
of
C
as
a
model
Frobenioid,
it
follows
from
[Mzk17],
Theorem
5.2,
(ii),
that
C
is
of
isotropic
and
model
type;
the
fact
that
C
is
of
sub-quasi-Frobenius-trivial
type
follows
from
[Mzk17],
Proposition
1.10,
(vi).
By
Proposition
3.4,
(ii)
(respectively,
by
the
deﬁnition
of
the
realiﬁcation
of
a
Frobenioid
—
cf.
[Mzk17],
Proposition
5.3),
it
follows
that
if,
moreover,
Λ
=
Z
(respectively,
Λ
=
R),
then
C
is
of
unit-proﬁnite
(respectively,
unit-trivial)
type;
the
condition
imposed
on
F
in
Deﬁnition
3.6,
(ii),
(b),
implies
immediately
that
C
is
not
of
group-like
type.
This
completes
the
proof
of
THE
ÉTALE
THETA
FUNCTION
73
assertion
(i).
As
for
assertion
(ii),
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
since
Πtp
X
acts
trivially
on
×
,
it
follows
[cf.
also
the
condition
imposed
on
F
in
Deﬁnition
3.6,
(ii),
(b)]
K
×
/OK
that
every
object
of
(C
un-tr
)birat
is
Frobenius-compact.
Thus,
assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions.
Assertion
(iii)
follows
immediately
from
Proposition
3.4,
(ii).
Assertion
(iv)
follows
formally
from
[Mzk17],
Proposition
1.13,
(iii)
[since,
by
assertion
(i)
of
the
present
Theorem
3.7,
“condition
(b)”
of
loc.
cit.
is
always
satisﬁed
by
objects
of
C].
This
completes
the
proof
of
Theorem
3.7.
Remark
3.7.1.
We
recall
[cf.
[Mzk18],
§0]
in
passing
that
if
D
is
of
weakly
indissectible
(respectively,
strongly
dissectible;
weakly
dissectible)
type,
then
so
is
C.
Remark
3.7.2.
We
recall
in
passing
that
D0
is
slim
[cf.
[Mzk14],
Example
3.10;
[Mzk14],
Remark

(Preservation
of
Base-ﬁeld-theoretic
Morphisms
and
Hulls)
Suppose
that
for
i
=
1,
2,
Ci
is
a
tempered
Frobenioid
whose
base
category
Di
is
of
FSMFF-type,
and
whose
divisor
monoid
Φi
is
non-dilating.
Let
∼
Ψ
:
C1
→
C2
be
an
equivalence
of
categories.
Then:
(i)
Suppose,
for
i
=
1,
2,
that
the
base
category
Di
of
Ci
is
Frobenius-slim.
Then
Ψ
preserves
the
base-ﬁeld-theoretic
morphisms.
(ii)
Suppose,
for
i
=
1,
2,
that
the
base
category
Di
of
Ci
is
Div-slim
[relative
to
Φi
].
Then
Ψ
preserves
the
base-ﬁeld-theoretic
morphisms
and
induces
a
compatible
equivalence
∼
C1bs-ﬂd
→
C2bs-ﬂd
of
the
subcategories
C1bs-ﬂd
⊆
C1
,
C2bs-ﬂd
⊆
C2
given
by
the
respective
base-ﬁeldtheoretic
hulls.
(iii)
Suppose
that
Ψ
preserves
the
base-ﬁeld-theoretic
morphisms,
and
that
Φ1
,
Φ2
are
cuspidally
pure.
Then
Ψ
preserves
the
non-cuspidal
and
cuspidal
pre-steps.
If,
moreover,
Φ1
,
Φ2
are
rational,
then
the
induced
isomorphism
of
divisor
monoids
∼
ΨΦ
:
Φ1
|C1
→
Φ2
|C2
[lying
over
Ψ]
of
[Mzk17],
Theorem
4.9,
preserves
non-cuspidal
elements
and
primes,
as
well
as
cuspidal
elements
and
primes.
Proof.
Indeed,
by
Theorem
3.7,
(i),
(ii),
C1
,
C2
are
of
standard
and
isotropic
type,
but
not
of
group-like
type.
In
particular,
by
[Mzk17],
Theorem
3.4,
(ii);
[Mzk17],
Theorem
4.2,
(i),
it
follows
that
Ψ
preserves
pre-steps
and
primary
steps.
Moreover,
Ψ
is
compatible
with
the
operation
of
passing
to
the
perfection
[cf.
[Mzk17],
Theorem
3.4,
(iii)].

Next,
we
consider
assertions
(i),
(ii).
By
applying
[Mzk17],
Theorem
3.4,
(iv),
in
the
case
of
assertion
(i),
and
[Mzk17],
Theorem
3.4,
(ii);
[Mzk17],
Corollary
4.11,
(ii),
in
the
case
of
assertion
(ii),
it
follows
that
Ψ
preserves
the
submonoids
“O

Now
observe
[cf.
Proposition
3.4,
(ii);
the
equivalences
of
categories
of
[Mzk17],
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d),
determined
by
the
operation
of
taking
the
zero
divisor
of
a
co-angular
pre-step]
that
a
pre-step
of
Ci
is
base-ﬁeld-theoretic
if
and
only
if
its
image
A
→
B
in
Cipf
may
be
written
as
a
[ﬁltered]
projective
limit
in
the
category
(Cipf
)coa-pre
[where
“coa-pre”
denotes
the

determined
B
by
the
(necessarily
co-angular)

of
pre-steps
A

B
that
are
abstractly
equivalent
[cf.
§0]
to
an
endomorphism
that
belongs
to
“O

Thus,
Ψ
preserves
the
base-ﬁeld-theoretic
pre-steps.
Note,
moreover,
that
Ψ
preserves
[cf.
[Mzk17],
Theorem
3.4,

the
factorization
[cf.
[Mzk17],
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iv),
(a)]
of
a
morphism
of
Ci
into
a
composite
of
a
morphism
of
Frobenius
type,
a
pre-step,
and
a
pull-back
morphism.
Thus,
we
conclude
that
Ψ
preserves
the
base-ﬁeld-theoretic
morphisms.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Next,
to
complete
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii),
let
us
observe
that,
under
the
assumptions
of
assertion
(ii),
Ψ
preserves
[cf.
[Mzk17],
Theorem
3.4,
(iii);
[Mzk17],
Corollary
4.11,
(ii)]
the
Frobenius-trivial
objects.
Since
Ψ
preserves
base-ﬁeld-theoretic
presteps
and
base-ﬁeld-theoretic
morphisms,
it
follows
from
the
explicit
description
of
the
base-ﬁeld-theoretic
hull
given
in
Remark
3.6.3
that
Ψ
preserves
the
[objects
and
morphisms
of
the]
subcategories
C1bs-ﬂd
⊆
C1
,
C2bs-ﬂd
⊆
C2
,
hence
induces
an
∼
equivalence
of
categories
C1bs-ﬂd
→
C2bs-ﬂd
,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
Since,
by
assumption,
Ψ
preserves
the
base-ﬁeld-theoretic
pre-steps,
we
conclude
from
Deﬁnition
3.6,
(v),
(a)
[cf.
also
the
ﬁrst
equivalence
of
categories
involving
pre-steps
of
[Mzk17],
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d)],
that
Ψ
preserves
the
primary
non-cuspidal
steps,
hence,
[by
Deﬁnition
3.6,
(v),
(b)]
that
Ψ
preserves
the
primary
cuspidal
steps.
Thus,
by
considering
the
“factorization
homomorphisms”
arising
from
the
fact
that
Φ1
,
Φ2
are
perf-factorial
[cf.
[Mzk17],
Deﬁnition
2.4,
(i),
(c)]
in
the
context
of
the
perfections
of
C1
,
C2
,
it
follows
that
Ψ
preserves
the
non-cuspidal
and
cuspidal
pre-steps.
The
remainder
of
∼
assertion
(iii)
now
follows
immediately
from
the
isomorphism
ΨΦ
:
Φ1
|C1
→
Φ2
|C2
of
[Mzk17],
Theorem
4.9
[which
is
applicable
in
light
of
Theorem
3.7,
(ii)].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii).
Remark
3.8.1.
Note
that
in
the
situation
of
Corollary
3.8,
(ii),
for
suitable
base
categories
[i.e.,
of
the
sort
that
appear
in
[Mzk18],
Theorem
2.4]
one
may
apply
∼
to
the
equivalence
of
categories
C1bs-ﬂd

C2bs-ﬂd
induced
by
Ψ
the
theory
of
the
category-theoreticity
of
the
Kummer

as
discussed
in

Theorem
2.4.
Remark
3.8.2.
In
the
situation

3.8,
suppose
further
that
Ψ

morphisms,
and
that
Φ1
,
Φ2
are
cuspidally
pure
and
rational
[cf.
Corollary
3.8,
(iii)].
Then
observe
that
by
considering
zero
divisors
of
baseﬁeld-theoretic
pre-steps
as
in
the
proof
of
Corollary
3.8,
(i),
(ii),
it
follows

Next,
let
us
denote
by

the

forming
the

of

“Φ0

of
Deﬁnition

for
some

Now
deﬁne
ell
Φell

ΦW

as
follows:
For
A
∈
Ob(DW

we
take
Φell

to
be
the
perf-saturation
[cf.

in
W

ΦW

of
the

in

such
log
log
that
the
composite
covering
Z∞

arises
as
the
generic
ﬁber
of
the

with

over
the

of

of
a

L
of
K;
the
superscript
Galois
group
denotes
the
submonoid
of
elements
ﬁxed
by
the
Galois

in

Here,
we
pause
to
observe
that
the
various
monoids
that
occur
in
the

limit
are
all
contained
in
ΦW
(A),
and
that
the

on

are
bijective
[cf.
Remark

Indeed,
this
bijectivity
follows
immediately
from
the
well-known

of
the
special
ﬁbers
of
the
“universal

that
appear
in
the

inductive
limit
[i.e.,

where
“|DW

is
with

to

deﬁned
in

Now
ell
ell
observe
that
ΦW
is
a
perfect
[cf.
the
deﬁnition
of
ΦW
ell
as
a
perf-saturation
inside
the

on

[manifestly

group-saturated
submonoid
of
the

ΦW
on

,
which
is,
moreover,
perf-factorial,
nondilating
[cf.

the

the
well-known

of
the
special

of

Also,
Φell
W
is
[manifestly]
independent,
up
to
natural
isomorphism,
of
the
choice
of

If
α

is
any
morphism
of

then
set
def
Dα

[α]
(⊆

—
where
we
regard
α
as
an
object
of
(DW
)B
–
cf.
the
notational
conventions
of
§0;
[Mzk17],
§0.
Thus,
Dα
is
a
quasi-temperoid
[cf.
[Mzk14],
Deﬁnition
A.1,
(ii)].
Also,
we
observe
that
DW
,
DX
,
DY
,
DU
are
special
cases
of
“Dα

[obtained
by
taking

X

Y

U

].
Note
that
we
have
a
natural

Dα

.
Now
let
us
write
def
ell
Φell
α
=
ΦW
|Dα
(⊆
ΦW

and
note
that
it
follows
immediately
from
the
above
discussion
that
this
[sub]monoid
ell
Φell
α
—
which
is
obtained
simply
by
restricting
the
functor
ΦW
via
some
functor
—
is
perfect,
group-saturated,
perf-factorial,
non-dilating,
and
cuspidally
pure.
Note,
moreover,
that
the
existence
of
the
theta
functions
discussed
in
§1
[cf.
especially
the
description
of
the
zeroes
and
poles
of
these
theta

given
in
Proposition

implies
that

Φell
α
is
also
rational
[cf.
Deﬁnition
3.6,

[Mzk17],
Deﬁnition
4.5,

In
particular,
it
follows
that:
This
monoid
Φell
α
[along
with
its

Section
4:
General
Bi-Kummer
Theory
In
the
present
§4,
we
apply
the
theory
of
tempered
Frobenioids
developed
in
§3
to
discuss
the
analogue,
for
log-meromorphic
functions
on
tempered
coverings
of
smooth
log
orbicurves
over
nonarchimedean
[mixed-characteristic]
local
ﬁelds,
of
the
Kummer
theory
for
p-adic
Frobenioids
developed
in
[Mzk18],
§2.
One
important
aspect
[i.e.,
in
a
word,
the
“bi”
portion
of
the
term
“bi-Kummer”]
of
the
“bi-Kummer
theory”
theory
developed
here
—
by
comparison,
for
instance,
to
the
Kummer
theory
for
arbitrary
Frobenioids
discussed
in
[Mzk18],
Deﬁnition
2.1
—
is
that
instead
of
just
taking
roots
of
the
given
log-meromorphic
function,
one
considers
roots
of
the
pair
of
sections
of
a
line
bundle
that
correspond,
respectively,
to
the
“numerator”
and
“denominator”
of
the
log-meromorphic
function
[cf.
Remark
4.3.1
below].
Another
important
feature
of
the
theory
developed
here
—
by
comparison
to
the
theory
of
[Mzk18],
§2,
for
p-adic
Frobenioids
—
is
the
absence
of
an
analogue
of
the
reciprocity
map
[cf.
Remark
4.4.1
below].
As
we
shall
see
in
§5
below
[cf.
Theorem
5.6
and
its
proof],
the
additional
“layer
of
complexity”
that
arises
from
the
former
feature
has
the
eﬀect
of
compensating
[to
a
certain
extent,
at
least
in
the
case
of
the
situation
discussed
in
§2]
for
the
“handicap”
constituted
by
the
latter
feature.
Finally,
we
remark
that
the
theory
developed
here
may
be
regarded
as
and,
indeed,
was
motivated
by
the
goal
of
developing
a
Frobenioidtheoretic
translation/generalization
—
via
the
theory
of
base-Frobenius
pairs
[cf.
[Mzk17],
Deﬁnition
2.7,
(iii);
[Mzk17],
Proposition
5.6]
—
of
the
scheme-theoretic
constructions
of
§1.
Let
X
log
,
K,
D0
=
Btemp
(X
log
)0
be
as
in
§3.
In
the
following
discussion,
we
ﬁx
a
tempered
Frobenioid
C
whose
monoid
type
is
Z,
whose
divisor
monoid
Φ
is
perfect,
whose
base
category
D
is
of
the
form
def
D
=
D0
[D]
(⊆
D0
)
[cf.
§0],
where
D
∈
Ob(D0
),
and
whose
base-ﬁeld-theoretic
hull
we
denote
by
def
C
bs-ﬂd
⊆
C.
Also,
we
ﬁx
a
Frobenius-trivial
object
A
∈
Ob(C)
such
that
Abs

=
Base(A
)
∈
Ob(D)
is
a
Galois
[cf.
[Mzk14],
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(iv)]
object.
Thus,
Abs

determines
normal
open
subgroups
H
⊆
Πtp
X;
bs-ﬂd
H
⊆
GK
bs-ﬂd
[i.e.,
H
is
the
image
of
H
in

]
of
the
tempered
fundamental
group
Πtp
X
of
tp
log
and
the
quotient
ΠX

GK
determined
by
the

group
of
K.
X
In
the
following
discussion,
we
shall
use
the
superscript
“birat”
(respectively,
“bs”)
to
denote
the
object

determined
by
a

Recall
that
pre-steps
of
C
map
to
isomorphisms
in
C
birat
[cf.

then
we

between

Proof.
The
suﬃciency
portion
of
assertion
(i)
is
immediate.
To
verify
the
necessity
portion
of
assertion
(i),
observe
that
by
the
equivalences
of
categories
of
[Mzk17],
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d),
the
“disjoint
supports”
condition
[cf.
Deﬁnition
4.1,
(i)]
on
the
Div(−)’s
of
the
components
of
a
fraction-pair

t
:
A

C
implies
the
∼
existence
of

v,


:
B
→
C
such
that
t
=
v
◦
s
,
t
=
v

◦
s
;
since,
moreover,
t
,
t
are
base-equivalent,
it
follows
that
v
=
v

◦
v

,
for
some
v

∈
O×
(C
).
On
the
other
hand,
since
the
fraction-pair
t
,
t
:
A
→
C
determines
the
same
element
of
O×
(Abirat
)
as
the
fraction-pair
s
,
s
:
A
→
C
,


we
thus
conclude
that
v
=
1.
Note
that
the
uniqueness
of
v
follows
from
the
total
epimorphicity
of
C.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
The
proof
of
assertion
(ii)
is
entirely
similar
[except
that
one
concludes
uniqueness
from
the
fact
that
pre-steps
are
always
monomorphisms
—
cf.
[Mzk17],
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(v),
(a)].
Next,
we
consider
assertions
(iii),
(iv).
First,
let
us
observe
that,
by
the
definition
of
“log-meromorphic”
[cf.
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(ii)],
it
follows
immediately
that
over
some
tempered
covering
of
X
log
that
occurs
as
the
“universal
combinatorial
covering”
of
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
X
log
with
stable,
split
reduction,
f
admits
an
N
-th
root.
Since,
moreover,
the
divisor
monoid
Φ
is
assumed
to
be
perfect,
it
follows
that
the
divisors
of
zeroes
and
poles
of
such
an
N
-th
root
belong
to
Φ(−)
of
the
tempered
covering
in
question.
Now
since
the
Frobenioid
C
is
of
model
[hence,
in
particular,
pre-model
—
cf.
[Mzk17],
Deﬁnition
4.5,
(i)]
type
[cf.
Theorem
3.7,
(i)],
it
follows
that
C
admits
a
base-Frobenius
pair
[cf.
[Mzk17],
Deﬁnition
2.7,
(iii)].
Thus,
the
existence
of
a
pair
of
commutative
diagrams
as
in
the
statement
of
assertion
(iii)
follows
by
translating
the
above
“scheme-theoretic
observations”
into
the
language
of
Frobenioids
—
cf.
[Mzk17],

of

Finally,
to
verify
the
uniqueness
up
to
isomorphism
of
such
a
pair
of
commutative
diagrams
as
stated
in
assertion
(iv),
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
by
replacing
82
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
α,
s
,
s
by
δ
−1
◦
α,
s
◦
δ,
s
◦
δ,
respectively,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
δ
is
the
identity.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
it
follows
from
the
“(N,
H
,
f
|AN
)-saturated-ness”
condition
in
the
statement
of
assertion
(iii)
[cf.
also
Proposition
3.4,
(ii)]
that
the
pull-back
∈
O×
(AN
)
or
∈
O×
(AN

of
any
element
∈

(A
)
[i.e.,

the
“pull-back
portion”
of
α,
α
—
cf.
Deﬁnition
4.1,
(iv),
(d)]
admits
an
N
-th
root.
Now
[in
light
of
this
observation]
the
existence
of
a
ζA
as
desired
follows
immediately
from
the
uniqueness
up
to
conjugation
by
a
unit
of
base-Frobenius
pairs
of
AN
,
AN
[cf.
[Mzk17],
Proposition
5.6],
by
thinking
of
α,
α
as
categorical
quotients
[cf.
Remark
4.1.1]
and
applying
the
base-triviality
and
Autampleness
of
the
full
subcategory
of
C
determined
by
the
Frobenius-trivial
objects
[cf.
[Mzk17],
Theorem
5.1,
(iii)].
The
existence
of
a
ζB
as
desired
follows
from
the
equivalences
of
categories
determined
by
pre-steps
of
[Mzk17],
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d).
The
essential
uniqueness
of
ζA
,
ζB
as
asserted
follows
immediately
from
the
various
conditions
imposed
on
ζA
,
ζB
.
This
completes
the
proof
of

)
∈
Φ(AN
)
are
ﬁxed
by
HAN
.
But
since
N
·
Div(sN
),
N
·
Div(sN
)
∈
Φ(AN
)
arise
as
pull-backs
to
AN
of
elements
of
Φ(A
)
[i.e.
Div(s
),
Div(s
)],
this
follows
from
the
fact
that
[by
deﬁnition]
H
acts
trivially
on
Abs

[together
with
the
fact
the
monoid
Φ(AN
)
is
torsion-free!].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Assertion
(iii)
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions
[cf.,
especially,
[Mzk18],
Deﬁnition
2.1,
(ii)].
Finally,
we
observe
that
assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
by
applying
Proposition
4.2,
(ii),
to
the
fraction-pairs
(sN
,
sN
)
and
(sN
,
sN
)
of
Proposition
4.2,
(iv)
[after
possibly
replacing
sN
by
u
◦
sN
].
Indeed,
since
strv
N
is
completely
determined
up
to
conjugation
by
an
element
of
O×
(AN
)
[cf.
Theorem
3.7,
(i);
[Mzk17],
Proposition
5.6.],
we
thus
conclude
that
the
collection
of
bi-Kummer
N
-th
roots
under
consideration
is
as
stated
in
assertion
(ii).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Remark
4.3.1.
Of
course,
even
without
applying
the
somewhat
nontrivial
theory
of
base-Frobenius
pairs
[i.e.,
[Mzk17],
Proposition
5.6],
liftings
to
AutC
(AN
)
of
individual
elements
of
HAN
[cf.
the
notation
of
Proposition
4.3,
(i)]
are
completely
determined
up
to
possible
translation
by
elements
of
O×
(AN
).
The
crucial
diﬀerence,
however,
between
an
indeterminacy
up
to
translation
by
elements
of
O×
(AN
)
and
an
indeterminacy
up
to
conjugation
by
elements
of
O×
(AN
)
is
that,
unlike
the
-gp
,
sN-gp
]
which
former,
the
latter
allows
one
to
work
with
sections
[i.e.,
strv
N
,
sN
are
group
homomorphisms.
Of
course,
the
Kummer
class
[which,
by
Proposition
4.3,
(iii),
is
determined
by
the
pair
(sN-gp
,
sN-gp
)]
is
always
a
[twisted]
homomorphism.
On
the
other
hand,
the
theory
of
base-Frobenius
pairs
allows
one
to
work
with
group
homomorphisms
[i.e.,
sN-gp
or
sN-gp
]
even
when
one
is
forced
to
restrict
one’s
attention
to
only
one
of
the
two
arrows
sN
or
sN
,
i.e.,
in
situations
where
one
is
not
allowed
to
work
with
the
fraction-pair
as
a
“single
entity”
—
cf.
the
84

theory
of

of
the

given

of
the

We

,
i.e.,
Ψ
is

with
bi-Kummer
N
-th
roots.
Proof.
First,
we
observe
that,
for
i
=
1,
2,
Ci
is
of
standard
and
isotropic
type,
but
not
of
group-like
type
[cf.
Theorem
3.7,
(i),
(ii)];
the
base
category
Di
of
Ci
is
slim
[cf.
Remark
3.7.2].
Thus,
Ψ
preserves
pre-steps,
morphisms
of
Frobenius
type,
Frobenius
degrees,
isometries,
and
base-Frobenius
pairs
[cf.
[Mzk17],
Theorem
3.4,
(ii),
(iii);
[Mzk17],
Corollary
5.7,
(i),
(iv)].
In
particular,
[cf.
also
the
existence
of
Ψbs
]
Ψ
preserves
Frobenius-trivial
objects.
Since
the
Frobenioid
determined
by
the
Frobenius-trivial
objects
of
Ci
is
of
base-trivial
type
[cf.
[Mzk17],
Theorem
5.1,
(iii)],
these
observations
[together
with
the
existence
of
Ψbs
]
imply
the
portion
of
assertion
(i)
concerning
Ψ.
The
portion
of
assertion
(i)
concerning
Ψbs
follows
immediately
from
the
theory
of
[quasi-]temperoids
[cf.
[Mzk14],
Proposition
3.2;
[Mzk14],
Theorem
A.4].
Next,
we
consider
assertions
(ii),
(iii).
The
existence
of
Ψbirat
follows
from
[Mzk17],
Corollary
4.10.
Next,
let
us
recall
that
Ψ
is
compatible
with
the
operation
of
passing
to
the
perfection
[cf.
Theorem
3.7,
(i),
(ii);
[Mzk17],
Theorem
3.4,
(iii)].
In
particular,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
category-theoreticity
of
sets
of
primes
given
in
[Mzk17],
Theorem
4.2,
(ii),
that
Ψ
preserves
base-equivalent
[cf.
the
existence
of
Ψbs
!]
pairs
of
pre-steps
whose
Div(−)’s
have
disjoint
supports.
The
remainder
of
assertions
(ii),
(iii)
then
follows
immediately
from
the
observations
thus
far,
the
existence
of
Ψbs
,
and
the
“manifestly
category-theoretic
nature”
of
bs-ﬂd
)-saturation”
[cf.
[Mzk18],
Deﬁnition
2.2,
(ii);
[Mzk2],
Lemma
1.3.8]
“(N,
H,i
and
Kummer
classes
[cf.
[Mzk18],
Deﬁnition
2.1,
(ii)].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertions
(ii),
(iii).
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iv).
Observe
that
Ψ
preserves
base-Frobenius
pairs
of
Frobenius-trivial
objects
and
[by
assertion
(ii)]
maps
N
-th
roots
of
fractionpairs
with
domain
isomorphic
to
A,1
to
N
-th
roots
of
fraction-pairs
with
domain
isomorphic
to
A,2
;
Ψbirat
maps
f1
→
f2
.
Thus,
assertion
(iv)
follows
formally
from
Proposition
4.3,
(i),
(ii).
Remark
4.4.1.
Observe
that
one
crucial
diﬀerence
between
the
bi-Kummer
theory
for
tempered
Frobenioids
considered
here
and
the
theory
of
[Mzk18],
§2,
in
the
case
of
p-adic
Frobenioids
is
that
in
the
present
case,
there
is
no
reciprocity
map.
This
fact
may
be
regarded
as
a
reﬂection
of
the
fact
that
the
tempered
group
Πtp
X
is
not
a
proﬁnite
group
of
cohomological
dimension
2
whose
cohomology
admits
a
duality
theory
of
the
sort
that
GK
does.
Put
another
way,
although
at
ﬁrst
glance,
the
Kummer
classes
of
Proposition
4.3,
(iii);
Theorem
4.4,
(iii),
may
appear
to
constitute
a
“purely
[tempered]
fundamental
group-theoretic
presentation”
of
the
Frobenioid-theoretic
rational
functions
under
consideration,
in
fact:
These
Kummer
classes
still
depend
on
a
crucial
piece
of
Frobenioid-theoretic
data
—
namely,
the
cyclotome
“μN
(−)”.
Of
course,
if
one
is
only
interested
in
this
cyclotome
up
to
isomorphism
[i.e.,
up
to
multiplication
by
an
element
of
(Z/N
Z)×
],
then
the
cyclotome
may
be
thought
THE
ÉTALE
THETA
FUNCTION
87
of
as
being
reconstuctible
from
the
cyclotomic
character
of
Πtp
X
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk2],
Proposition
1.2.1,
(vi)].
On
the
other
hand,
working
with
the
coeﬃcient
cyclotome
up
to
isomorphism
amounts,
in
eﬀect,
[at
the
level
of
rational
functions]
to

×
-powers
—
which
is
typically
unacceptable
working
with
rational
functions
up
to
Z
in
applications
[e.g.,
where
one
wants,
for
instance,
to
specify
the
theta
function,

×
-powers!].
This
technical
issue
of
“rigidity
of
the
not
the
theta
function
up
to
Z
Frobenioid-theoretic
cyclotome”
is,
in
fact,
a
central
theme
of
bi-Kummer
theory
and
will
be
discussed
further
in
§5
below.

SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
Section
5:
The
Étale
Theta
Function
via
Tempered
Frobenioids
In
the
present
§5,
we
carry
out
the
goal
of
translating
the
scheme-theoretic
constructions
of
§1
into
the
language
of
Frobenioids,
by
applying
the
general
biKummer
theory
of
§4.
This
translation
yields,
in
particular,
a
Frobenioid-theoretic
construction
of
the
mono-theta
environments
of
§2
[cf.
Theorem
5.10,
(iii)].
In
the
following
discussion,
we
return
to
the
situation
of
Example
3.9.
Suppose
further
that
the
morphism
α
:
A
→
B
of
Example
3.9,
(iv),
is
the
identity
morphism,
and
that
“A”
is
one
of
the
smooth
log
orbicurves
X
log
;
C
log
;
X
log
;
C
log
;
Ẋ
log
;
Ċ
log
;
Ẋ
log
;
Ċ
log
[each
of
which
is
geometrically
connected
over
the
ﬁeld
K
=
K̈]
of
Deﬁnition
2.5,
(i),
(ii),
for
some
odd
integer
l
≥
1.
We
shall
refer
to
the
case
where
“A”
is
X
log
,
C
log
,
Ẋ
log
,
or
Ċ
log
as
the
single
underline
case
and
to
the
case
where
“A”
is
X
log
,
C
log
,
Ẋ
log
,
or
Ċ
log
as
the
double
underline
case.
Now
the
divisor
monoid
Φ
=
Φell
α
def
def
on
D
=
Dα
[cf.
Example
3.9]
determines
a
tempered
Frobenioid
C
of
monoid
type
Z
over
the
base
category
D.
We
would
like
to
apply
the
theory
of
§4
in
the
present
situation.
Thus,
in
the
single
underline
(respectively,
double
underline)
case,
we
take
the
object
A
of
the
theory
of
§4
to
be
the
[Frobenius-trivial]
object
deﬁned
by
the
trivial
line
log
bundle
over
the
object
Ÿ
log
(respectively,
Ÿ
)
of
the
discussion
preceding
Deﬁnition
2.7.
Observe
that
this
Abs

is
“characteristic”
—
that
is
to
say,
it
is
preserved
by
arbitrary
self-equivalences
of
D
[cf.
Propositions
2.4,
2.6]
—
hence,
in
particular,
Galois.
Let
∼
Ψ:C
→C
be
a
self-equivalence
of
C;
N
≥
1
an
integer.
Then
it
follows
from
Example

(iv),
that
we
have
the
following:
Proposition
5.1.
(Applicability
of
the
General
Theory)
The
Frobenioid
C
is
a
tempered
Frobenioid
of
rationally
standard
type
over
a
slim
base
category
D,
whose
monoid
type
is
Z,
and
whose
divisor
monoid
Φ(−)
is
perfect,
perf-factorial,
non-dilating,
and
cuspidally
pure.
In
particular,
C
and
the
∼
self-equivalence
Ψ
:
C
→
C
satisfy
all
of
the
hypotheses
of
Corollary
3.8,

∼

Theorem
4.4
[for
“C1
”,
“C2
”,
“Ψ
:

”].
Remark
5.1.1.
In
Proposition
5.1,
as
well
as
in
the
discussion
of
the
remainder
of
the
present
§5,
we
restrict
our
attention
to
self-equivalences,
instead
of
considering
THE
ÉTALE
THETA
FUNCTION

arbitrary
equivalences
between
possibly
distinct
categories,
as
in
Theorem
4.4,
or
“functorial
group-theoretic
algorithms”,
as
in
Corollaries
2.18,
2.19.
We
do
this,
however,
mainly
to
simplify
the
discussion
[in
particular,
the
notation].
That
is
to
say,
the
extension
to
the
case
of
arbitrary
equivalences
between
possibly
distinct
categories
satisfying
similar
hypotheses
is,
for
the
most
part,
immediate.
Moreover,
by
sorting
through
the
various
arguments
used
in
the
proofs
of
the
present
paper,
as
well
as
in
the
proofs
of
the
results
of
[Mzk17],
[Mzk18],
that
are
quoted,
one
concludes
immediately
the
existence
of
“functorial
category-theoretic
algorithms”,
in
the
style
of
Corollaries
2.18,
2.19.
We
leave
the
routine
clerical
details
to
the
interested
reader.
Next,
we
reconsider
the
discussion
of
§1
[where
we
take
the
“N
”
of
§1
to
be
l
·
N
]
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
theory
of
§4.
To
this
end,
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
log
log
[together
with
the
fact
that
l
·
N
is
divisible
that
by
the
deﬁnition
of
Ÿ
,
Z̈l·N
log
by
l],
it
follows
immediately
that
the
covering
Z̈l·N
→
X
log
factors
through
the
log
→
X
log
.
Thus,
if
we
pull-back
the
line
bundle
L̈l·N
on
Ÿl·N
[cf.
the
covering
Ÿ
discussion
preceding
Lemma
1.2]
to
Z̈l·N
[or,
equivalently,
the
line
bundle
Ll·N
on
Yl·N
,
ﬁrst
to
Zl·N
,
and
then
to
Z̈l·N
]
so
as
to
obtain
a
line
bundle
L̈l·N
|Z̈l·N
on
Z̈l·N
,
then
the
pull-backs
to
Z̈l·N
of
(1)
the
section
sl·N
∈
Γ(Zl·N
,
Ll·N
|Zl·N
)
of
Proposition
1.1,
(i);
(2)
the
theta
trivialization
τl·N
∈
Γ(Ÿl·N
,
L̈l·N
)
of
Lemma
1.2
may
be
interpreted
as
morphisms
V(OZ̈l·N
)
→
V(L̈l·N
|Z̈l·N
)
—
i.e.,
as
morphisms
between
objects
of
C.
Now
we
have
the
following:
Proposition
5.2.
sion:
(Bi-Kummer
Theory)
In
the
notation
of
the
above
discus-
(i)
The
pair
of
morphisms
of
C
determined
by
“sl·N

“τl·N
”
constitutes
an
l
·
N
-th
root
of
a
right
fraction-pair
[cf.
Proposition
4.2,
(iii)]
of
[the
Frobenioidtheoretic
version
of
the
log-meromorphic
function
constituted
by]
the
theta
function
Θ̈
of
Proposition
1.4,
or,
alternatively,
an
N
-th
root
of
a
right
fractionpair
[cf.
Proposition
4.2,
(iii)]
of
[the
Frobenioid-theoretic
version
of
the
logmeromorphic
function
constituted
by]
an
l-th
root
of
the
theta
function
Θ̈
[cf.
Remark
4.3.2].
(ii)
The
group
actions
of
Proposition
1.1,
(ii);
Lemma
1.2,
arising
from
“sl·N
”,
“τl·N
”,
respectively,
are
precisely
the
actions
determined
by
the
bi-Kummer
l
·
N
-th
root
[cf.
Proposition
4.3,
(i)]
arising
from
the
l
·
N
-th
root
of
(i).
(iii)
The
Kummer
class
determined
by
the
bi-Kummer
l
·
N
-th
root
of
(ii)
[cf.
Proposition
4.3,
(iii)]
corresponds
precisely
to
the
reduction
modulo
l
·
N
of
the
90
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
class
“η̈
Θ
”
of
Proposition
1.3
—
i.e.,
to
the
“étale
theta
function”
—
relative
to
the
natural
isomorphism
[cf.
Remark
5.2.1
below]
between
“μl·N
(−)”
[cf.
Proposition
4.3,
(iii)]
and
ΔΘ
⊗
(Z/l
·
N
Z)
[cf.
Proposition
1.3].
Similarly,
the
Kummer
class
determined
by
the
bi-Kummer
N
-th
root
of
the
N
-th
root
of
(i)
[cf.
Proposition
4.3,
(iii)]
corresponds
precisely
to
the
reduction
modulo
N
of
the
class
“η̈
Θ
”
of
the
discussion
preceding
Deﬁnition
2.7
—
i.e.,
to
an
l-th
root
of
the
“étale
theta
function”
—
relative
to
the
natural
isomorphism
between
“μN
(−)
=
l
·
μl·N
(−)”
and
(l
·
ΔΘ
)
⊗
(Z/N
Z).
Proof.
These
assertions
follow
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions.
In
the
case
of
assertion
(i),
we
observe
that
the
“(l
·
N
,
H
,
f
|Al·N
)-saturated-ness”
condition
of
Proposition
4.2,
(iii),
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
the
ﬁeld
J¨l·N
in
§1.
Remark
5.2.1.
The
natural
isomorphisms
of
Proposition
5.2,
(iii),
constitute
a
scheme-theoretic
ingredient
in
the
otherwise
Frobenioid-theoretic
formulation
of
Proposition
5.2
[cf.
Remark
4.4.1].
The
translation
of
this
ﬁnal
scheme-theoretic
ingredient
into
category
theory
is
the
topic
of
Proposition
5.5;
Theorems
5.6,
5.7
below.
Next,
we
consider
divisors.
Recall
that
the
special
ﬁber
of
“Ÿ”
may
be
described
as
an
inﬁnite
chain
of
copies
of
the
projective
line,
joined
to
one
another
at
the
points
“0”
an
“∞”
[cf.,
e.g.,
the
discussion
preceding
Proposition
1.1].
In
particular,
there
is
a
natural
bijection
[cf.
the
discussion
at
the
beginning
of
§1]
∼
Prime(Φ(A
))ncsp
→
Z
which
is
well-deﬁned,
up
to
the
operations
of
translation
by
an
element
of
Z
and
multiplication
by
±1
on
Z.
Moreover,
there
is
a
natural
surjection
Prime(Φ(A
))csp

Prime(Φ(A
))ncsp
[i.e.,
given
by
considering
the
“irreducible
component
of
the
special
ﬁber
that
contains
the
cusp(s)
determined
by
the
cuspidal
prime”].
Also,
let
us
observe
that
since
all
the
cusps
of
Ÿ
log
arise
from
K̈-rational
points,
it
follows
immediately
that
one
has
the
following
cuspidal
version
of
Remark
3.8.2:
If
p,
q
are
cuspidal
primes
of
Φ(A
),
then
there
is
a
natural
isomorphism
between
“primary
components”
∼
Φ(A
)p
→
Φ(A
)q
—
determined
by
identifying
the
elements
on
each
side
that
arise
from
[schemetheoretic]
prime
log-divisors.
∼
Next,
let
us
choose
an
isomorphism
Ψ(A
)
→
A
of
C
[cf.
Proposition
5.1;
Theorem
4.4,
(i)].
Let
us
write
∼

Φ(A

→
Φ(A
)
THE
ÉTALE

with

Ψ(A

Proposition
5.3.
(Category-theoreticity
of
the
Geometry
of
Divisors)
In
the
notation
of
the
above
discussion,
ΨΦ
A
preserves
the
following
objects:
(i)
non-cuspidal
and
cuspidal
elements;
(ii)
the
natural
isomorphisms
between
distinct
non-cuspidal
primary
components
of
Φ(A
)
[cf.
Remark
3.8.2];
(iii)
the
natural
isomorphisms
[described
in
the
discussion
above]
between
distinct
cuspidal
primary
components
of
Φ(A
);
(iv)
the
natural
surjection
Prime(Φ(A
))csp

Prime(Φ(A
))ncsp
;
∼
(v)
the
natural
bijection
Prime(Φ(A
))ncsp
→
Z
[up
to
translation
by
an
element
of
Z
and
multiplication
by
±1];
(vi)
the
AutC
(A
)-orbit
of
the
divisor
of
zeroes
and
poles
∈
Φ(A
)gp
of
[the
Frobenioid-theoretic
version
of
the
log-meromorphic
function
constituted
by]
the
theta
function
Θ̈
of
Proposition
1.4.
Proof.
The
preservation
of
(i)
(respectively,
(ii))
follows
immediately
from
Corollary
3.8,
(iii)
(respectively,
Remark
3.8.2).
To
verify
the
preservation
of
the
remaining
objects,
it
suﬃces
to
consider
the
well-known
“intersection
theory
of
divisors
supported
on
the
chain
of
copies
of
the
projective
line”
that
constitutes
the
special
divisor
of
“Ÿ”
as
follows:
Let
us
refer
to
pairs
of
elements
of
Φ(A
)gp
whose
diﬀerence
lies
in
the
image
of
the
birational
function
monoid
of
the
Frobenioid
C
as
linearly
equivalent.
Let
us
refer
to
an
element
∈
Φ(A
)gp
which
is
linearly
equivalent
to
0
as
principal.
Let
us
refer
to
as
cuspidally
minimal
any
cuspidal
element
of
Φ(A
)gp
whose
support
[cf.
[Mzk17],
Deﬁnition
2.4,
(i),
(d)]
is
a
ﬁnite
set
of
minimal
cardinality
among
the
cardinalities
of
supports
of
cuspidal
elements
of
Φ(A
)gp
which
are
linearly
equivalent
to
the
given
element.
Now
the
preservation
of
(iv)
follows
by
considering
the
support
of
primary
cuspidal
elements
a
∈
Φ(A
)
such
that,
for
some
b
∈
Φ(A
)csp
which
is
co-prime
to
a
[i.e.,
a,
b
have
disjoint
supports],
b
−
a
is
cuspidally
minimal
and
linearly
equivalent
to
a
primary
non-cuspidal
element
n
∈
Φ(A
).
That
is
to
say,
[by
the
well-known
intersection
theory
of
divisors
supported
on
the
chain
of
copies
of
the
projective
line]
in
this
situation,
n
is
linearly
equivalent
to
some
element
∈
Φ(A
)gp
of
the
form
n1
+
n2
−
a,
where
n1
,
n2
∈
Φ(A
)csp
are
primary
cuspidal
elements
that
map,
respectively,
via
the
natural
surjection
of
(iv)
to
the
two
non-cuspidal
primes
that
are
adjacent
[in
the
“chain
of
copies
of
the
projective
line”]
to
the
noncuspidal
prime
determined
by
n.
Moreover,
relative
to
the
isomorphisms
of
(iii),
the
92
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
multiplicities
of
n1
,
n2
are
equal
to
each
other
as
well
as
to
half
the
multiplicity
of
a.
Thus,
the
natural
isomorphisms
of
(iii)
may
be
obtained
by
applying
the
natural
isomorphisms
of
(ii)
to
the
“n”
that
occur
for
various
“a”;
the
natural
surjection
of
(iv)
is
obtained
by
mapping
the
prime
determined
by
a
to
the
prime
determined
by
n.
To
verify
the
preservation
of
(v),
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
the
relation
of
adjacency
[in
the
“chain
of
copies
of
the
projective
line”]
between
elements
p,
q
∈
Φ(A
)ncsp
is
preserved.
But
this
follows
[again
from
the
well-known
intersection
theory
of
divisors
supported
on
the
chain
of
copies
of
the
projective
line]
by
observing
that
if
a
∈
p,
b
∈
q
correspond
via
the
natural
isomorphisms
of
(ii),
then
p,
q
are
adjacent
(respectively,
not
adjacent)
if
and
only
if
every
cuspidally
minimal
c
∈
Φ(A
)gp
which
is
linearly
equivalent
to
a
+
b
has
support
of
cardinality
4
(respectively,
5
or
6).
[Here,
the
numbers
“4”,
“5”,
“6”
correspond
to
the
number
of
non-cuspidal
primes
that
are
either
contained
in
or
adjacent
to
a
prime
contained
in
the
support
of
a
+
b.]
Finally,
the
preservation
of
(vi),
at
least
up
to
Q>0
-multiples,
follows
immediately
by
considering
the
principal
divisors
∈
Φ(A
)gp
in
light
of
the
preservation
of
(i),
(ii),
(iii),
and
(v)
[cf.
the
description
of
the
divisor
of
zeroes
and
poles
of
Θ̈
in
Proposition
1.4,
(i)];
to
eliminate
the
indeterminacy
with
respect
to
Q>0
multiples,
it
suﬃces
to
consider
the
zero
divisor
[cf.
Remark
3.8.2]
of
a
generator
of
O
(A
)/O
×
(A
)
∼
=
Z≥0
[cf.
Proposition
3.4,

Next,
let
us
recall

If

then
we

Deﬁnition

We
shall
say
that
S

is
(l,

)-theta-saturated
if
the
following
conditions
are
satisﬁed:
(a)
S
is

[cf.
[Mzk18],
Deﬁnition
2.1,
(i)];
(b)
(l

⊗
Z/N
Z
is
of
cardinality
N
.
Now
we
may
begin
to
address
the
issue
discussed
in
Remark
5.2.1:
Proposition
5.5.
(Frobenioid-theoretic
Cyclotomic
Rigidity)
In
the
notation
of
the
above
discussion,
the
second
Kummer
class
of
Proposition
5.2,
(iii),
determines
an
isomorphism
∼
(l

⊗
Z/N
Z

(S)
(=

THE
ÉTALE

FUNCTION
93
for
all
(l,
N
)-theta-saturated
S
∈
Ob(C).
This
isomorphism
is
functorial
with
respect
to
the
subcategory
of
C
determined
by
the
linear
morphisms
of
(l,
N
)theta-saturated
objects.
Proof.
Indeed,
if
S

∈
Ob(C)
is
an
l
·
N
-codomain
of
an
l
·
N
-th
root
of
a
right
fraction-pair
of
Θ̈
[i.e.,
as
discussed
in
Proposition
5.2,
(i)],
then
it
follows
from
the
detailed
description
of
the
“étale
theta
class”
in
Proposition
1.3
that
the
resulting
Kummer
class
[cf.
Proposition
5.2,
(iii)]
determines
an
isomorphism
∼
(l
·
ΔΘ
)S

⊗
Z/N
Z
→
μN
(S

)
which
is
manifestly
“functorial”
[in
the
evident
sense,
with
respect
to
l
·
N
-codomains
of
l
·
N
-th
roots
of
right
fraction-pairs
of
Θ̈].
Thus,
we
may
transport
this
isomorphism
from
S

to
an
arbitrary

S

Proof.
Indeed,
by
Proposition
5.1;
[Mzk17],
Theorem
3.4,
(iv),
(v),
it
follows
that
∼
Ψ
preserves
“O×
(−)”
and
induces
a
1-compatible
equivalence
Ψbs
:
D
→
D,
hence,
[cf.
[Mzk14],
Proposition
3.2]
an
outer
automorphism
of
the
tempered
fundamental
group
of
the
smooth
orbicurve
in
question.
In
particular,
it
follows
from
Propositions
2.4,
2.6
that
Ψ
preserves
“(l
·
ΔΘ
)(−)
”.
Thus,
it
follows
immediately
that
Ψ
preserves
the
(l,
N
)-theta-saturated
objects.
Next,
let
S2
∈
Ob(C)
be
an
(l,
N
)-theta-saturated
l
·
N
-codomain
of
an
l
·
N
-th
root
of
a
right
fraction-pair
of
Θ̈
[i.e.,
as
discussed
in
Proposition
5.2,
(i)]
such
that
S2bs
is
“characteristic”
[i.e.,
its
isomorphism
class
is
preserved
by
arbitrary
self-equivalences
of
D];
write
s
,
s
:
S1
→
S2
for
the
pair
of
base-equivalent
pre-steps
that
appear
in
this
l
·
N
-th
root
[so
S1
is
Frobenius-trivial].
Now
since
Ψ
preserves
pre-steps
and
Frobenius-trivial
objects
∼
and
induces
a
1-compatible
self-equivalence
Ψbs
:
D
→
D
[cf.
the
proof
of
Theorem
4.4],
it
follows
that
Ψ
maps
this
pair
of
base-equivalent
pre-steps
to
a
pair
of
baseequivalent
pre-steps
t
,
t
:
T1
→
T2
such
that
T1
is
Frobenius-trivial,
hence
isomorphic
to
S1
[cf.
our
assumption
that
S1bs
∼
=
S2bs
is
characteristic;
[Mzk17],
Theorem
5.1,
(iii)]
.
Moreover,
since
Ψ
[essentially]
preserves
the
divisor
of
zeroes
and
poles
of
Θ̈
[cf.
Proposition
5.3,
(vi)],
it
follows
[cf.
the
equivalences
of
categories
involving
pre-steps
of
[Mzk17],
Deﬁnition
∼
∼
1.3,
(iii),
(d)]
that
there
exist
isomorphisms
γ1
:
S1
→
T1
,
γ2
:
S2
→
T2
,
u
∈
O×

such
that
γ2
◦
s
=
t
◦
γ1
,
u
◦
γ2
◦
s
=
t
◦
γ1
.
Thus,
by
forming
the
resulting
group
homomorphisms
s
-gp
,
s
-gp
:
HS2
→
AutC
(S2
);
t
-gp

(T2
)
[cf.
Proposition
4.3,

and
Kummer
classes
[cf.
Proposition
4.3,
(iii)],
and
observing
that
the
Kummer
class
of
the
“constant

u
does
not
aﬀect
the
restriction
of
the
resulting
Kummer
classes
to
(l
·
ΔΘ
)S2
,
(l
·
ΔΘ
)T2
,
we
conclude
∼
that
Ψ
does
indeed
transport
the
natural
isomorphism
(l
·ΔΘ
)S2
⊗Z/N
Z
→
μN
(S2
)
of
Proposition
5.5
to
the
corresponding
isomorphism
for
T2
.
Moreover,
by
the
construction
applied
in
the
proof
of
Proposition
5.5,
this
preservation
of
the
natural
isomorphism
of
Proposition
5.5
in
the
speciﬁc
case
of
S2
is
suﬃcient
to
imply
the
preservation
of
the
natural
isomorphism
of
Proposition
5.5
for
arbitrary
(l,
N
)theta-saturated
S
∈
Ob(C).
This
completes
the
proof
of

In

Proof.
Indeed,
this
follows
immediately
by
considering
compatible
systems
as
in
Remark
4.3.2
and
applying
the
theory
of
the
rigidity
of

to
the

[cf.

above,
in
light
of
the
crucial
isomorphisms
∼
(l·ΔΘ
)S
⊗Z/N
Z
→
μN
(S)
of
Proposition
5.5,
which,
by
Theorem
5.6,
are
preserved
by
Ψ.
Remark
5.7.1.
Note
that
the
“rigidity
up
to
possible
multiplication
by
a
2l-th
root
of
unity”
asserted
in
Theorem
5.7
is
substantially
stronger
than
[what
was
in
eﬀect]
the
preservation
of
Θ̈
up
to
multiplication
by
an
arbitrary
constant
function
∈
O×
(−)
[cf.
the
“u”
appearing
in
the
proof
of
Theorem
5.6],
that
was
observed
by
considering
divisors
[i.e.,
Proposition
5.3,
(vi)]
in
the
proof
of
Theorem
5.6.
Next,
we
consider
theta
environments.
For
the
remainder
of
the
present
§5,
we
suppose
that:
“A”
arises
from
X
log
.
Write
sN
,
sN
:
AN
→
B
N
for
the
pair
of
base-equivalent
morphisms
of
C
determined
by
the
sections
“sl·N
”,
“τl·N
”
of
the
discussion
preceding
Proposition
5.2
[so
sN
,
sN
constitute
an
N
-th
root
of
a
right
fraction-pair
of
an
l-th
root
of
the
theta
function
Θ̈
—
cf.
Proposition
5.2,
(i)].
Note
that
the
zero
divisor
Div(sN
)
∈
Φ(AN

of
sN
descends
[relative
to
the
unique
morphism
Abs

to
Φ(A)
[cf.
Proposition

bs
follows
that

THE
ÉTALE
THETA
FUNCTION
99
Proof.
First,
we
observe
that
by
Proposition
5.1,
the
hypotheses
of
Theorem
4.4
are
satisﬁed.
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
Since
Ψ
preserves
Frobenius-trivial
objects
[cf.
the
proof
of
Theorem
4.4],
to
show
that
Ψ
preserves
the
isomorphism
∼
class
of
AN
,
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
the
equivalence
Ψbs
:
D
→
D
[cf.
Theorem
4.4]
induced
by
Ψ
preserves
the
isomorphism
class
of
the
objects
of
D
determined
log
log
”,
“Ÿ
”;
but
this
follows
immediately
[in
light
of
the
deﬁnitions
of
the
by
“Z̈l·N
various
tempered
coverings
involved]
from
Proposition
2.4.
Now
the
fact
that
Ψ
preserves
the
isomorphism
class
of
BN
follows
immediately
from
Proposition
5.3,
(vi).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
First,
we
observe
that
it
follows
from
the
existence
of
Ψbs
and
the
fact
that
Ψ
preserves
pre-steps
[cf.
the
proof
of
Theorem
4.4]
that
Ψ
preserves
“O
(−)”,
as
well
as
base-equivalent
pairs
of
pre-steps.
In
particular,
it
follows
that
applying
Ψ
followed
by
conjugation
by
β
preserves
O
(BN
),
birat
).
Thus,
[cf.
Proposition
3.4,
(ii)]
we
conclude
[by
considering
O×
(BN
),
O×
(BN
Galois-,
i.e.,
AutC
(BN
)-invariants]
that
Ψbirat
Aut
preserves
the
image
of
the
natural
×
1/N
×
×
birat
)
.
Finally,
the
portion

→
O
(BN
),
hence
also
(K
×
)1/N
,
(OK
-gp
-gp
of
assertion
(ii)
concerning
Im(sN
),
Im(sN
),
EN
follows
by
observing
that
Ψ
preserves
N
-th
roots
of
fraction
pairs
[cf.
Theorem
4.4,
(ii)],
together
with
the
corresponding
bi-Kummer
N
-th
roots
[cf.
Theorem
4.4,
(iv)],
for
[the
Frobenioidtheoretic
version
of
the
log-meromorphic
function
constituted
by]
l-th
roots
of
the
theta
function
[i.e.,
up
to
the
indeterminacies
discussed
in
the
statement
of
Theorem
5.7
—
cf.
Theorem
5.7].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
First,
observe
that
it
follows
from
the
existence
of
κ
that,
in
the
following
argument,
we
may
treat
as
a
single
ﬁxed
homomorphism,
rather
than
just
a
“μN
-outer
homomorphism”.
Next,
we
observe
that
by
taking
κ
to
be
the
inner
automorphism
of
AutC
(BN
)
determined
by
conjugating
by
the
element
δ1
·
δ2
·
δ3
∈
AutC
(BN
)
of
assertion
(ii),
we
may
assume
that
the
restrictions
of
ΨAut
◦
,
κ
◦
to
the
image
of
sN-Π
:
Πtp
→
EΠ
N
coincide,
Ÿ
that
extends
up
to
composition
with
an
automorphism
of
the
topological
group
Πtp
Ÿ
tp
to
an
automorphism
of
the
topological
group
Πtp
X
[which
lies
in
the
ΠX
-conjugacy
bs
class
of
automorphisms
of
Πtp
Y
induced
by
Ψ
].
Thus,
by
applying
Corollary
2.18,
(iv),
it
follows
that
we
may
choose
γ
so
that
the
restrictions
of
ΨAut
◦
,
κ
◦
◦
γ
to
the
image
of
sN-Π
coincide
[precisely].
Moreover,
by
applying
the
compatible
[cf.
Lemma
5.9,
(v)],
category/group-theoretic
[cf.
Theorem
5.6;
Corollary
2.19,
(i)]
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphisms
of
Proposition
5.5
and
Corollary
2.19,
(i)
[cf.
also
Remark
2.19.3],
it
follows
that
the
restrictions
of
ΨAut
◦
,
κ
◦
◦
γ
to
tp
Ker(EΠ
N

ΠY
)
coincide.
Thus,
we
conclude
that
the
restrictions
of
ΨAut
◦
,
∼
Π
κ
◦
◦
γ
to
Πtp
[μN

⊆
Πtp
Y
[μN
]
→
EN
[where
we
apply
the
isomorphism
of
Lemma
Ÿ
tp
5.9,
(iv)]
coincide.
Since
[Πtp
Y
:
ΠŸ
]
=
2,
it
thus
follows
that
the
diﬀerence
between
ΨAut
◦
,
κ
◦
◦
γ
determines
a
cohomology
class

Proposition
3.4,
(ii),
and

Thus,

two
automorphism

[cf.

and
its

we
obtain
a

such
that

as

This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion

Remark
5.10.1.
Observe
that
Theorem
5.10,
(iii),
may
be
interpreted
as
asserting
that
a
mono-theta
environment
may
be
“extracted”
from
the
tempered
Frobenioids
under
consideration
in
a
purely
category-theoretic
fashion.
In
particular,
by
coupling
this
observation
with
Corollary
2.18
[cf.
also
Remark
2.18.2],
we
conclude
that:
A
mono-theta
environment
may
be
“extracted”
naturally
from
both
the
tempered
Frobenioids
and
the
tempered
fundamental
groups
under
consideration
in
a
purely
category/group-theoretic
fashion.
That
is
to
say,
a
mono-theta
environment
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
minimal
core
common
to
both
the
[tempered-]étale-theoretic
and
Frobenioid-theoretic
approaches
to
the
theta
function
[cf.
Remark
2.18.2].
Put
another
way,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
general
theory
of
Frobenioids,
although
the
““étale-like”
[e.g.,
temperoid]”
and
“Frobenius-like”
portions
of
a
Frobenioid
are
fundamentally
alien
to
one
another
in
nature
[cf.
the
“fundamental
dichotomy”
discussed
in
[Mzk17],
Remark
3.1.3],
a
mono-theta
environment
serves
as
a
sort
of
bridge,
relative
to
the
theory
of
theta
function,
between
these
two
fundamentally
mutually
alien
aspects
of
the
structure
of
a
Frobenioid.
Remark
5.10.2.
The
structure
of
a
Frobenioid
may
be
thought
of
as
consisting
of
a
sort
of
extension
structure
of
the
base
category
by
various
line
bundles.
From
this
point
of
view:
The
theta
section
portion
of
a
mono-theta
environment
may
be
thought
as
a
sort
of
canonical
splitting
of
this
extension,
determined
by
the
theory
of
the
étale
theta
function
[cf.
the
discussion
of
canonicality/rigidity
in
the
Introduction].
This
point
of
view
is
reminiscent
[cf.
the
point
of
view
of
Remark
5.10.1]
of
the
notion
of
a
“canonical
uniformizing
MF
∇
-object”
discussed
in
[Mzk1],
Introduction,
§1.3.
Remark
5.10.3.
One
key
feature
of
a
mono-theta
environment
is
the
inclusion
in
the
mono-theta
environment
of
the
“distinct
cyclotome”
μN
(BN
)
∼
=
Ker(EΠ
N

tp
tp
ΠY
)
[i.e.,
a
cyclotome
distinct
from
the
various
cyclotomes
associated
to
ΠY
].
Here,
we
pause
to
observe
that:
This
“distinct
cyclotome”
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“Frobenius
germ”
—
i.e.,
a
“germ”
or
“trace”
of
the
“Frobenius
structure”
of
the
tempered
Frobenioid
C
constituted
by
raising
elements
of
O
(−)
to
N≥1
-powers.
THE
ÉTALE
THETA
FUNCTION
101
Indeed,
when
a
mono-theta
environment
is
not
considered
as
a
separate,
abstract
mathematical
structure,
but
rather
as
a
mathematical
structure
associated
to
the
tempered
Frobenioid
C,
the
operation
of
“raising
to
N≥1
-powers”
elements
of
O
(−)
in
C
is
compatible
with
the
natural
multiplication
action
of
N≥1
on
this
distinct
cyclotome.
Moreover,
these
actions
of
N≥1
are
compatible
with
the
operation
of
forming
Kummer
classes
[e.g.,
passing
from
the
Frobenioid-theoretic
version
of
the
theta
function
to
its
Kummer
class,
the
“étale
theta
function”],
as
well
as
with
the
consideration
of
values
∈
K
×
of
functions
[e.g.,
the
theta
function
—
cf.
Proposition
1.4,
(iii)],
relative
to
the
reciprocity
map
on
elements
of
K
×
[cf.
[Mzk18],
Theorem
2.4].
On
the
other
hand,
it
is
important
to
note
that:
These
actions
of
N≥1
only
make
sense
within
the
tempered
Frobenioid
C;
that
is
to
say,
they
do
not
give
rise
to
an
action
of
N≥1
on
the
mono-theta
environment
[considered
as
a
separate,
abstract
mathematical
structure].
Indeed,
the
fact
that
one
does
not
obtain
a
natural
action
of
N≥1
on
the
mono-theta
environment
may
be
understood,
for
instance,
by
observing
that
the
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphism
∼
(l
·
ΔΘ
)
⊗
(Z/N
Z)
→
Δ[μN
]
[cf.
Corollary
2.19,
(i);
Remark
2.19.3]
is
not
compatible
with
the
endomorphism
of
the
“distinct
cyclotome”
Δ[μN
]
given
by
multiplication
by
M
∈
N≥1
,
unless
M
≡
1
modulo
N
.
[Here,
it
is
useful
to
recall
that
there
is
no
natural
action
of
N≥1
on
Πtp
X
that
induces
the
multiplication
action
on
N≥1
on
l
·
ΔΘ
!]
Alternatively,
this
property
may
be
regarded
as
a
restatement
of
the
interpretation
[cf.
Remark
2.19.3]
of
the
cyclotomic
rigidity
of
a
mono-theta
environment
as
a
sort
of
“integral
structure”,
or
“basepoint”,
relative
to
the
action
of
N≥1
.
Moreover,
we
remark
that
it
is
precisely
the
presence
of
this
rigidity
property
that
motivates
the
interpretation,
stated
above,
of
the
“distinct
cyclotome”
as
a
sort
of
“Frobenius
germ”
—
i.e.,
something
that
is
somewhat
less
than
the
“full
Frobenius
structure”
present
in
a
Frobenioid,
but
which
nevertheless
serves
as
a
sort
of
“trace”,
or
“partial,
but
essential
record”,
of
such
a
“full
Frobenius
structure”.
Remark
5.10.4.
(i)
Relative
to
the
theory
of
§2,
which
does
not
involve
Frobenioids,
the
significance
of
the
introduction
of
Frobenioids
may
be
understood
as
follows:
The
use
of
Frobenioids
allows
one
to
consider,
in
a
natural
way,
the
monoid
√
(Θ̈(
−1)−1
·
Θ̈)N
[cf.
Theorem
5.7]
of
powers
of
the
theta
function.
This
is
not
possible
for
“abstract
mono-theta
environments”,
for
numerous
reasons,
centering
around
the
preservation
of
cyclotomic
rigidity
[cf.
Remarks
2.19.2,
2.19.3,
5.10.3,
as
well
as
Remark
5.12.5
below].
One
way
to
understand
this
phenomenon
102
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
is
to
think
of
the
various
discrete
monoids
[i.e.,
“copies
of
N”]
that
appear
in
the
structure
of
a
Frobenioid
as
imparting
a
rigidity
to
Frobenioids
that
takes
the
place
of
the
cyclotomic
rigidity
of
an
abstract
mono-theta
environment
[cf.
Remark
2.19.4].
From
this
point
of
view,
the
tempered
Frobenioid
C
involved
may
be
thought
of
as
furnishing
a
sort
of
“discrete
Tate-module-like
unraveling”
—
i.e.,
a

means
of
passing
from
“Q/Z(1)”
to
“N”
[as
opposed
to
Hom(Q/Z(1),
Q/Z(1))
=
Z]
—
of
the
various
abstract
mono-theta
environments
that
appear
in
the
theory
[cf.
the
notion
of
“Frobenius
germs”
discussed
in
Remark
5.10.3].
√
(ii)
If
one
is
only
interested
in
the
monoid
“(Θ̈(
−1)−1
·
Θ̈)N
”
of
(i),
then
it
might
appear
at
ﬁrst
glance
that
instead
of
working
with
the
tempered
Frobenioid
C,
it
suﬃces
instead
to
work
with
the
associated
birationalization
C
birat
.
On
the
other
hand,
it
is
precisely
by
working
with
C
[instead
of
C
birat
],
i.e.,
by
working
with
ample
line
bundles,
that
one
may
access
the
“numerator”
and
“denominator”
of
a
meromorphic
function
as
separate,
independent
entities.
Moreover,
it
is
this
aspect
of
C
that
is
of
crucial
importance
in
relating
the
Frobenioid-theoretic
aspects
of
(i)
to
an
abstract
mono-theta
[i.e.,
as
opposed
to
bi-theta,
which
would
force
one
to
sacriﬁce
discrete
rigidity
—
cf.
Remark
2.16.1]
environment.
(iii)
In
addition
to
the
signiﬁcance
of
the
use
of
Frobenioids
as
discussed
in
(i),
more
generally
the
introduction
of
Frobenioids
is
useful
in
that,
unlike
tempered
fundamental
groups,
Frobenioids
tend
to
be
compatible
with
“Frobenius-like”
structures
[e.g.,
structures
that
involve
some
sort
of
linear
ordering]
—
cf.
the
discussion
of
[Mzk17],
Remark
3.1.3.
By
contrast,
by
thinking
of
an
abstract
mono-theta
environment
as
arising
from
the
tempered
fundamental
group
[cf.
Corollary
2.18],
one
may
work
with
such
mono-theta
environments
in
situations
in
which
it
is
important
to
be
free
of
the
constraints
arising
from
such
“Frobenius-like”,
“order-conscious”
structures.
Before
proceeding,
we
review
a
“well-known”
result
in
category
theory.
Lemma
5.11.
(Non-category-theoreticity
of
Particular
Morphisms
in
an
Abstract
Equivalence
Class)
Let
E
be
a
category;
G,
H,
I
∈
Ob(E)
distinct
objects
of
E;
f
:
G
→
H,
g
:
G
→
G
morphisms
of
E;
αG
∈
AutE
(G),
αH
∈
AutE
(H),
αI
∈
AutE
(I)
automorphisms.
Then
there
exists
a
self-equivalence
∼
Ξ
:
E
→
E
that
induces
the
identity
on
Ob(E)
and
is
isomorphic
to
the
identity
self-equivalence
via
an
isomorphism
that
maps
G
→
αG
∈
AutE
(G);
H
→
αH
∈
AutE
(H);
I
→
αI
∈
AutE
(I);
J
→
idJ
∈
AutE
(J
)
—
where
idJ
denotes
the
identity
morphism
J
→
J
—
for
all
J
∈
Ob(E)
such
that
−1
J
=
G,
H,
I.
In
particular,
Ξ
maps
f
→
αH
◦
f
◦
α−1
G
,
g
→
αG
◦
g
◦
αG
.
Proof.
First,
let
us
observe
that
by
composing
the
self-equivalences
obtained
by
applying
Lemma
5.11
with
two
of
the
three
automorphisms
αG
,
αH
,
αI
taken
to
be
THE
ÉTALE
THETA
FUNCTION
103
the
identity,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
αH
,
αI
are
the
respective
identity
automorphisms
of
H,
I.
Now
[one
veriﬁes
immediately
that]
one
may
deﬁne
an
equivalence
of
categories
[that
is
isomorphic
to
the
identity
self-equivalence]
∼
Ξ:E
→E
which
restricts
to
the
identity
on
Ob(E)
and
maps
j
→
j
◦
(αG
)−1
;
j

→
αG
◦
j

;
j

→
αG
◦
j

◦
α−1
G
;
j

→
j

for
j
∈
HomE
(G,
J),
j

∈
HomE
(J,
G),
j

∈
HomE
(G,
G),
j

∈
HomE
(J,
J

),
where
G
=
J,
J

∈
Ob(E).
Thus,
Ξ
satisﬁes
the
properties
asserted
in
the
statement
of
Lemma
5.11.
Finally,
we
apply
the
“general
nonsense
category
theory”
of
Lemma
5.11
to
explain
certain
aspects
of
the
motivation
that
underlies
the
theory
of
mono-theta
environments.

In

Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertions
(i),
(ii).
Since
βN,N

is
an
isometry
of
Frobenius
bs
bs
degree
M
,
it
follows
that
the
pull-back
via
the
morphism
BN

→
BN
of
D
of
the
line
bundle
that
determines
the
object
BN
is
isomorphic
to
the
M
-th
tensor
power
of
the
line
bundle
that
determines
the
object
BN

.
Moreover,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
discussion
of
line
bundles
in
§1
[cf.
the
discussion
preceding
Proposition
1.1]
that
all
positive
tensor
powers
of
these
line
bundles
are
nontrivial,
and
that
the
isomorphism
classes
of
these
line
bundles
are
preserved
by
arbitrary
bs
automorphisms
of
BN

.
In
particular,
we
conclude
immediately
that
BN
,
BN

are
non-isomorphic
both
to
one
another
and
to
the
Frobenius-trivial
object
[i.e.,
object
deﬁned
by
a
trivial
line
bundle]
AN
.
Moreover,
by
multiplying
by
the
(M
−
1)-th
tensor
power
of
the
section
of
line
bundles
that
determines
either
of
the
morphisms
sN

,
sN

:
AN

→
BN

[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
5.12.5,
(iii),
below],
we
obtain
a
linear
morphism
ι
:
BN

→
BN
.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertions
(i),
(ii).
Finally,
in
light
of
assertion
(i),
assertion
(iii)
follows
immediately
from
Lemma
5.11.
Remark
5.12.1.
Let
E
be
a
category.
Then
for
any
E
∈
Ob(E),
AutE
(E)
has
a
natural
group
structure.
Indeed,
this
group
structure
is
precisely
the
group
structure
that
allows
one,
for
instance,
to
represent
the
group
structure
of
a
tempered
topological
group
category-theoretically
via
temperoids
or
to
represent
[cf.
THE
ÉTALE
THETA
FUNCTION
105
Theorem
5.10,
(iii)]
the
group
structure
portion
of
a
mono-theta
environment
category-theoretically
via
tempered
Frobenioids.
On
the
other
hand,
in
both
of
these
cases,
one
is,
in
fact,
not
just
interested
in
the
group
structure,
but
rather
in
the
topological
group
structure
of
the
various
objects
under
consideration.
From
this
point
of
view:
Temperoids
[or,
for
that
matter,
Galois
categories]
allow
one
to
represent
the
topological
group
structure
under
consideration
via
the
use
of
numerous
objects
corresponding
to
the
various
open
subgroups
of
the
topological
group
under
consideration,
as
opposed
to
the
use
of
a
“single
universal
covering
object”,
whose
automorphism
group
allows
one
to
represent
the
entire
group
under
consideration
via
a
single
object,
but
only
at
the
expense
of
sacriﬁcing
the
additional
data
that
constitutes
the
topology
of
the
topological
group
under
consideration.
This
approach
of
using
“numerous
objects
corresponding
to
the
various
open
subgroups”
carries
over,
in
eﬀect,
to
the
theory
of
tempered
Frobenioids,
since
such
tempered
Frobenioids
typically
appear
over
base
categories
given
by
[the
subcategory
of
connected
objects
of]
a
temperoid.
Remark
5.12.2.
In
general,
if
one
tries
to
consider
systems
[e.g.,
projective
systems,
such
as
“universal
coverings”]
in
the
context
of
the
“numerous
objects
approach”
of
Remark
5.12.1,
then
one
must
contend
with
the
following
problem:
Suppose
that
to
each
object
E
in
some
given
given
collection
I
of
isomorphism
classes
of
objects
of
E,
one
associates
certain
data
E
→
DE
[such
as
the
group
AutE
(E),
or
some
category-theoretically
determined
subquotient
of
AutE
(E)],
which
one
may
think
of
as
a
functor
on
the
full
subcategory
of
E
consisting
of
objects
whose
isomorphism
class
belongs
to
I.
Then:
One
must
contend
with
the
fact
there
is
no
natural,
“category-theoretic”
choice
[cf.
Lemma
5.11]
of
a
particular
morphism
ζ
:
E
→
F
,
among
the
various
composites
αF
◦
ζ
◦
αE
—
where
αE
∈
AutE
(E),
αF
∈
AutE
(F
)
—
for
the
task
of
relating
DE
to
DF
.
In
particular:
One
necessary
condition
for
the
data
constituted
by
the
functor
E
→
DE
to
form
a
coherent
system
is
the
condition
that
the
data
DE
be
invariant
with
respect
to
the
various
automorphisms
induced
by
the
various
AutE
(E)
—
i.e.,
that
AutE
(E)
act
as
the
identity
on
DE
.

One
“classical”
example
of
this
phenomenon
is
the
category-theoretic
reconstruction
of
a
tempered
topological
group
from
its
associated
temperoid
[cf.
[Mzk14],
Proposition
3.2;
the
even
more
classical
case
of
Galois
categories],
where
one
is
obliged
to
work
with
topological
groups
up
to
inner
automorphism
[cf.
also
Remark
5.12.8
below].
Remark
5.12.3.
Now
we
return
to
our
discussion
of
Frobenioid-theoretic
monotheta
environments,
in
the
context
of
Theorem
5.10,
(iii).
If,
instead
of
working
with
“ﬁnite”
mono-theta
environments,
one
attempts
to
work
with
the
projective
system
of
mono-theta
environments
determined
by
letting
N
vary
[cf.
Remark
2.16.1],
then
one
must
contend
with
the
“constant
multiple
indeterminacy”
of
Corollary
5.12,
(iii),
relative
to
κ
,
of
ζ
=
βN,N

[i.e.,
where
we
note
that
βN,N

may
be
thought
of
as
a
typical
morphism
appearing
in
this
projective
system].
In
particular,
the
existence
of
this
indeterminacy
implies
that,
in
order
to
obtain
the
analogue
of
Theorem
5.10,
(iii)
—
i.e.,
to
describe,
in
a
category-theoretic
fashion,
the
relationship
between
a
single
abstract,
static
external
projective
system
of
mono-theta
environments
and
the
projective
system
of
mono-theta
environments
constructed
inside
a
tempered
Frobenioid
—
one
must
work
with
mono-theta
environments
up
to
the
indeterminacies
arising
from
the
μN
-outer
action
of
∼
×
1/N
×
1/N
×
AutC
(BN
)
⊇
O×
(BN
)
⊇
(OK
)

(OK
)
/μN
(BN
)
→
OK
[cf.
Lemma
5.8].
That
is
to
say,
one
must
assume
that
one
only
knows
the
theta
section
portion
of
a
mono-theta
environment
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.13,
(ii),
(c)]
up
to
a
constant
multiple.
Put
another
way,
one
is
forced
to
sacriﬁce
the
constant
multiple
rigidity
of
Corollary
2.19,
(iii).
Moreover,
we
observe
in
passing
that
attempting
to
avoid
sacriﬁcing
“constant
multiple
rigidity”
by
working
with
bi-theta
environments
[cf.
the
discussion
preceding
Lemma
5.8]
does
not
serve
to
remedy
this
situation,
since
this
forces
one
to
sacriﬁce
“discrete
rigidity”
[cf.
Remark
2.16.1].
Thus,
in
summary:
A
[ﬁnite,
not
proﬁnite!]
mono-theta
enviroment
serves
in
eﬀect
to
maximize
the
rigidity,
i.e.,
to
minimize
the
indeterminacy,
of
the
[l-th
roots
of
the]
theta
function
that
one
works
with
in
the
following
three
crucial
respects:
(a)
cyclotomic
rigidity
[cf.
Corollary
2.19,
(i);
Remark
2.19.4];
(b)
discrete
rigidity
[cf.
Corollary
2.19,
(ii);
Remarks
2.16.1,
2.19.4];
(c)
constant
multiple
rigidity
[cf.
Corollary
2.19,
(iii);
the
discussion
of
the
present
Remark
5.12.3;
Remark
5.12.5
below]
—
all
in
a
fashion
that
is
compatible
with
the
category-theoretic
representation
of
the
topology
of
the
tempered
fundamental
group
discussed
in
Remark
5.12.1.
This
“extraordinary
rigidity”
of
a
mono-theta
environment,
along
with
the
“bridging
aspect”
discussed
in
Remarks
2.18.2,
5.10.1,
5.10.2,
5.10.3,
were,
from
the
point
of
THE
ÉTALE
THETA
FUNCTION
107
view
of
the
author,
the
main
motivating
reasons
for
the
introduction
of
the
notion
of
a
mono-theta
environment.
Remark
5.12.4.
With
regard
to
the
projective
systems
of
mono-theta
environments
discussed
in
Remark
5.12.3,
if,
instead
of
trying
to
relate
a
single
abstract
such
system
to
a
Frobenioid-theoretic
system,
one
instead
takes
the
approach
of
relating,
at
each
ﬁnite
step
[i.e.,
at
each
constituent
object
of
the
system],
an
abstract
mono-theta
environment
to
a
Frobenioid-theoretic
mono-theta
environment
via
Theorem
5.10,
(iii)
—
hence,
in
particular,
taking
into
account
the
“AutC
(BN
)orbit”
indeterminacies
that
occur
at
each
step
when
one
considers
such
relationships
—
then
one
can
indeed
establish
a
category-theoretic
relationship
between
projective
systems
of
mono-theta
environments
external
and
internal
to
the
Frobenioid
C
without
sacriﬁcing
the
cyclotomic,
discrete,
or
constant
multiple
rigidity
properties
discussed
in
Remark
5.12.3.
Put
another
way,
the
diﬀerence
between
“attempting
to
relate
whole
systems
at
once
as
in
Remark
5.12.3”
and
“applying
Theorem
5.10,
(iii),
at
each
ﬁnite
step”
may
be
thought
of
as
a
matter
of
“how
one
arranges
one’s
parentheses”,
that
is
to
say,
as
the
diﬀerence
between

Corollary
2.19,

Remark
5.12.5.
(i)
Suppose
that
instead
of
working
with
ﬁrst
powers
of
l-th
roots
of
the
theta
function,
one
tries
instead
to
consider
an
M
-th
power
version
[where
M
>
1
is
an
integer]
of
the
mono-theta
environment.
As
discussed
in
Remark
2.19.2,
if
one
takes
the
most
naive
approach
to
doing
this,
then
one
must
sacriﬁce
cyclotomic
rigidity
in
the
sense
that
instead
of
obtaining
cyclotomic
rigidity
for
“μN
”
[where,
say,
N
is
divisible
by
M
],
one
obtains
cyclotomic
rigidity
only
for
the
submodule
“M
·
μN
⊆
μN
”.
Moreover,
the
resulting
structures
end
up
being
intrisically
indistinguishable
[cf.
Remark
2.19.3]
from
their
ﬁrst
power
counterparts,
where
108
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
“N
”
is
replaced
by
“N/M
”.
In
particular,
in
order
to
consider
an
“M
-th
power
version”
of
the
mono-theta
environment
in
a
meaningful
fashion,
one
is
led
to
consider,
in
addition,
[the
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphism
arising
from]
some
“ﬁrst
power
version”,
together
with
data
exhibiting
the
“M
-th
power
version”
as
the
M
-th
power
of
the
“ﬁrst
power
version”.
(ii)
Thus,
one
is
led,
for
instance,
to
consider
systems
consisting
of
the
following
data:
(a)
an
M
-th
power
version
of
the
mono-theta
environment;
(b)
a
ﬁrst
power
version
[i.e.,
the
usual
version]
of
the
mono-theta
environment;
(c)
data
relating
these
two
versions
[i.e.,
to
the
eﬀect
that
the
“M
-th
power
version”
is
indeed
obtained
as
the
M
-th
power
of
the
“ﬁrst
power
version”].
Here,
(c)
amounts,
in
eﬀect,
to
the
consideration
of
morphisms
such
as
the
morphisms
ι
or
βN,N

of
Corollary
5.12.
In
particular,
the
phenomenon
discussed
in
Remark
5.12.2
manifests
itself,
i.e.,
one
must
contend
with
the
constant
multiple
indeterminacy
discussed
in
Corollary
5.12,
(iii).
(iii)
One
approach
to
attempting
to
avoid
the
constant
multiple
indeterminacy
that
arose
in
(ii)
[i.e.,
avoid
the
use
of
“ι”,
“βN,N

”]
is
to
consider
collections
of
data
consisting
of
the
following:
(a)
an
M
-th
power
version
of
the
mono-theta
environment;
(b)
the
Frobenioid-theoretic
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphism
of
Proposition
5.5.
At
ﬁrst
glance,
this
allows
one
to
avoid
the
“constant
multiple
indeterminacy”
that
arises
from
working
with
“systems
of
objects”
[cf.
Remark
5.12.2],
by
restricting
the
data
to
data
associated
to
a
single
object
of
the
Frobenioid.
Closer
inspection,
however,
reveals
a
more
complicated
picture.
Indeed,
recall
from
the
proof
of
Proposition
5.5
that
the
isomorphism
of
(b)
was
obtained
by
transporting,
via
linear
morphisms,
the
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphism
obtained
from
a
ﬁrst
power
version
of
the
mono-theta
environment.
Moreover,
let
us
observe
that
this
transportation
operation
is
performed
on
the
data
AutD
((−)bs
),
μN
(−)
[or,
more
generally,
O×
(−)]
of,
say,
BN

,
BN
[cf.
the
proof
of
Proposition
5.5]
—
i.e.,
data
which
constitutes
a
sort
of
“semi-simpliﬁcation”
of
the
“extension
structure”
of
a
Frobenioid
discussed
in
Remark
5.10.2.
On
the
other
hand,
there
is
no
evident
way
to
extend
such
a
transportation
operation
so
as
to
apply
to
the
“extension
structure”
[cf.
Remark
5.10.2]
of
the
exact
sequence
1
→
O×
(−)
→
AutC
((−))
→
AutD
((−)bs
)
→
1
[for
objects
“(−)”,
such
as
BN

,
BN
,
which
are
Aut-ample
—
cf.
the
discussion
preceding
Lemma
5.8].
Put
another
way,
to
perform
this
transportation
operation
requires
one
to
work
up
to
an
indeterminacy
with
respect
to
[so
to
speak
“unipotent
upper-triangular”]
“shifting
automorphisms”
arising
from
cocycles
of
AutD
((−)bs
)
with
coeﬃcients
in
O×
(−)
(⊇
μN
(−))
[cf.
the
situation
of
Proposition
2.14,
(ii)],
×
which
includes,
in
particular,
a
constant
[i.e.,
OK
-]
multiple
indeterminacy
[cf.
the
∼
×
1/N
×
)
/μN
(BN
)
→
OK
in
collection
of
cocycles
determined
by
the
image
of
(OK
1
bs
H
(AutD
(BN
),
μN
(BN
)!].
More
generally,
by
considering
Kummer
classes
of
logmeromorphic
functions
[such
as
the
étale
theta
function!
—
cf.
the
proof
of
Corollary
5.12],
it
follows
that
this
“shifting
automorphism
indeterminacy”
implies,
in
particular,
an
indeterminacy
which
is,
in
eﬀect,
a
sort
of
Galois/Kummer-theoretic
translation
of
working
with
line
bundles
birationally.
Note,
moreover,
that
the
THE
ÉTALE
THETA
FUNCTION
109
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphism
[cf.
Corollary
2.19,
(i)]
arising
from
the
speciﬁc
splitting
determined
by
the
theta
section
is
not
preserved
by
[so
to
speak
“unipotent
upper-triangular”]
“shifting
automorphisms”.
Thus,
in
summary:
The
operation
of
relating
the
isomorphism
of
(b)
to
the
“M
-th
power
version”
of
such
a
cyclotomic
rigidity
isomorphism
arising
from
(a)
—
i.e.,
exhibiting
the
“M
-th
power
version”
of
(a)
as
the
M
-th
power
of
the
isomorphism
of
(b)
—
may
only
be
performed
after
passing
to
the
“semisimpliﬁed
data”
AutD
((−)bs
),
μN
(−).
On
the
other
hand,
applying
the
operation
of
“multiplication
by
M
”
to
the
portion
of
the
“semi-simpliﬁed
data”
constituted
by
μN
(−)
amounts
precisely
to
the
situation
discussed
in
Remark
2.19.3
[cf.
also
(i)
above;
Remark
5.10.3].
That
is
to
say,
this
causes
problems
arising
from
the
intrinsic
indistinguishability
of
the
domain
and
codomain
copies
of
“μN
(−)”
that
occur
when
one
multiplies
by
M
.
On
the
other
hand,
to
attempt
to
assign
“distinct
labels”
to
these
domain
and
codomain
copies
of
“μN
(−)”
amounts,
in
essence,
to
working
with
non-isomorphic
tensor
powers
of
some
line
bundle,
i.e.,
to
returning,
in
eﬀect,
to
the
situation
discussed
in
(ii)
above.
(iv)
Finally,
we
note
that
another
aspect
of
the
lack
of
canonical
splittings
of
the
exact
sequence
1
→
O×
(−)
→
AutC
((−))
→
AutD
((−)bs
)
→
1
of
(iii)
is
that,
relative
to
the
automorphism
indeterminacies
discussed
in
Remark
5.12.2,
there
is
no
natural
way
to
achieve
a
situation
in
which
the
inner
automorphism
indeterminacies
of
the
tempered
fundamental
group
[i.e.,
“AutD
((−)bs
)”]
remain,
but
the
constant
multiple
indeterminacies
[i.e.,
“O×
(−)”]
are
eliminated.
Remark
5.12.6.
At
this
point,
it
is
useful
to
reﬂect
[cf.
Remark
2.19.4]
on
the
signiﬁcance
of
rigidifying
the
“constant
multiple
indeterminacy”
and
“shifting
automorphism
indeterminacy”
of
Remarks
5.12.3,
5.12.5.
To
this
end,
we
observe
that
these
types
of
indeterminacy
are
essentially
multiplicative
notions
[cf.
the
cases
discussed
in
Remark
2.19.4].
Thus,
to
work
“modulo
these
sorts
of
indeterminacy”
can
only
be
done
at
the
cost
of
sacriﬁcing
the
additive
structures
[cf.
Remark
2.19.4]
implicit
in
the
ring/scheme-theoretic
origins
of
the
various
objects
under
consideration.
Another
important
observation
in
this
context
is
that
the
theory
of
Kummer
classes
depends
essentially
on
the
extension
structure
of
a
Frobenioid,
i.e.,
breaks
down
completely
if
one
“passes
to
semi-simpliﬁcations”,
as
in
Remark
5.12.5,
(iii).
Remark
5.12.7.
(i)
One
way
to
understand
the
“constant
multiple
indeterminacy”
phenomena
observed
in
Remarks
5.12.3,
5.12.5
is
as
a
manifestation
of
the
nontriviality
of
the
extension
structure
of
a
Frobenioid
discussed
in
Remark
5.10.2.
(ii)
Note
that
one
way
to
attempt
to
avoid
this
“nontrivial
extension
structure
of
a
Frobenioid”
[which
arises
essentially
from
working
with
nontrivial
line
bundles]
110
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
is
to
try
to
work
strictly
with
rational
functions
[such
as
the
theta
function],
i.e.,
to
work
with
the
birationalizations
[i.e.,
in
which
“all
line
bundles
becomes
trivial”]
of
the
Frobenioid
“C”
of
Theorems
5.6,
5.10;
Corollary
5.12.
On
the
other
hand,
at
the
Galois/Kummer-theoretic
level,
this
amounts
to
working
strictly
with
étale
theta
functions
[i.e.,
without
theta
environments],
hence
gives
rise
to
the
same
“nondiscreteness
phenomena”
as
those
that
appeared
in
the
case
of
bi-theta
environments
[cf.
Remarks
2.16.1;
5.10.4,
(ii)].
Remark
5.12.8.
Of
course,
the
automorphism
indeterminacy
with
regard
to
individual
objects
of
a
category
discussed
in
Remark
5.12.2
also
applies
to
the
various
base
categories
—
i.e.,
[essentially]
connected
temperoids
—
of
the
[tempered]
Frobenioids
that
appear
in
the
above
discussion.
On
the
other
hand,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
the
various
objects
that
we
construct
out
of
the
associated
tempered
fundamental
groups
are
invariant
with
respect
to
inner
automorphisms
in
a
fashion
that
is
compatible
with
the
topology
of
the
tempered
fundamental
group
[cf.
Remark
5.12.1].
For
instance,
the
construction
of
the
tempered
fundamental
group
of
a
connected
temperoid
involves
projective
systems
that
satisfy
the
analogue
[cf.
Remark
2.15.2]
of
the
discrete
rigidity
property
[cf.
Corollary
2.19,
(ii)]
of
a
monotheta
environment.
Moreover,
the
étale
theta
function
is
a
collection
of
cohomology
classes
in
the
[continuous]
cohomology
of
the
tempered
fundamental
group,
hence
is
invariant
with
respect
to
inner
automorphisms.
Remark
5.12.9.
Perhaps
a
sort
of
“unifying
principle”
underlying
the
“constant
multiple
indeterminacy”
phenomena
observed
in
Remarks
5.12.3,
5.12.5,
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
discrete
rigidity
discussed
in
Remark
2.16.1,
on
the
other,
may
be
expressed
in
the
following
fashion:
Although
at
ﬁrst
glance,
two
[or
many]
pieces
of
data
may
appear
to
be
likely
to
yield
“more
information”
than
“one”
piece
of
data,
in
fact,
the
more
pieces
of
data
that
one
considers
the
greater
the
indeterminacies
are
that
arise
in
describing
the
internal
relations
between
these
pieces
of
data.
Moreover,
these
greater
indeterminacies
may
[as
in
the
case
of
systems
of
objects
of
a
Frobenioid
in
Remarks
5.12.3,
5.12.5,
or
bi-theta
environments
in
Remark
2.16.1]
ultimately
result
in
“less
information”
than
the
information
resulting
from
a
single
piece
of
data
[cf.
the
discussion
in
the
Introduction].
