(1.) All tempered groups [hence also proﬁnite groups that are regarded as tempered
groups] (respectively, all temperoids) that appear in the present paper should be
assumed to be equipped with a topology that admits a countable basis (respectively, assumed to be connected temperoids associated to such tempered groups).
This assumption is necessary in order to ensure that the index sets of “universal
covering pro-objects” implicit in the deﬁnition of the tempered fundamental group
associated to a connected temperoid [cf. [Mzk11], Remark 3.2.1] may to be taken
to be countable. This countability of the index sets involved implies that the various objects that constitute such a universal covering pro-object admit a compatible
system of basepoints, i.e., that the obstruction to the existence of such a compatible
system — which may be thought of as an element of a sort of “nonabelian R1 lim
←−”
— vanishes. In order to deﬁne the tempered fundamental group in an intrinsically meaningful fashion, it is necessary to know the existence of such a compatible
system of basepoints.
