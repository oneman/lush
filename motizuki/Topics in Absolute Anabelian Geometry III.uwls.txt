Abstract.
In
the
present
paper,
which
forms
the
third
part
of
a
three-part
series
on
an
algorithmic
approach
to
absolute
anabelian
geometry,
we
apply
the
absolute
anabelian
technique
of
Belyi
cuspidalization
developed
in
the
second
part,
together
with
certain
ideas
contained
in
an
earlier
paper
of
the
author
concerning
the
category-theoretic
representation
of
holomorphic
structures
via
either
the
topological
group
SL2
(R)
or
the
use
of
“parallelograms,
rectangles,
and
squares”,
to
develop
a
certain
global
formalism
for
certain
hyperbolic
orbicurves
related
to
a
oncepunctured
elliptic
curve
over
a
number
ﬁeld.
This
formalism
allows
one
to
construct
certain
canonical
rigid
integral
structures,
which
we
refer
to
as
log-shells,
that
are
obtained
by
applying
the
logarithm
at
various
primes
of
a
number
ﬁeld.
Moreover,
although
each
of
these
local
logarithms
is
“far
from
being
an
isomorphism”
both
in
the
sense
that
it
fails
to
respect
the
ring
structures
involved
and
in
the
sense
[cf.
Frobenius
morphisms
in
positive
characteristic!]
that
it
has
the
eﬀect
of
exhibiting
the
“mass”
represented
by
its
domain
as
a
“somewhat
smaller
collection
of
mass”
than
the
“mass”
represented
by
its
codomain,
this
global
formalism
allows
one
to
treat
the
logarithm
operation
as
a
global
operation
on
a
number
ﬁeld
which
satisﬁes
the
property
of
being
an
“isomomorphism
up
to
an
appropriate
renormalization
operation”,
in
a
fashion
that
is
reminiscent
of
the
isomorphism
induced
on
diﬀerentials
by
a
Frobenius
lifting,
once
one
divides
by
p.
More
generally,
if
one
thinks
of
number
ﬁelds
as
corresponding
to
positive
characteristic
hyperbolic
curves
and
of
once-punctured
elliptic
curves
on
a
number
ﬁeld
as
corresponding
to
nilpotent
ordinary
indigenous
bundles
on
a
positive
characteristic
hyperbolic
curve,
then
many
aspects
of
the
theory
developed
in
the
present
paper
are
reminiscent
of
[the
positive
characteristic
portion
of]
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory.

Summary
of
Main
Results
Let
k
be
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
the
ﬁeld
Qp
of
p-adic
numbers
[for
p
a
prime
def
number];
k
an
algebraic
closure
of
k;
Gk
=
Gal(k/k).
Then
the
starting
point
of
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
lies
in
the
elementary
observation
that
although
the
p-adic
logarithm
×
logk
:
k
→
k
[normalized
so
that
p
→
0]
is
not
a
ring
homomorphism,
it
does
satisfy
the
important
property
of
being
Galois-equivariant
[i.e.,
Gk
-equivariant].
def
In
a
similar
vein,
if
F
is
an
algebraic
closure
of
a
number
ﬁeld
F
,
GF
=
Gal(F
/F
),
and
k,
k
arise,
respectively,
as
the
completions
of
F
,
F
at
a
nonarchimedean
prime
of
F
,
then
although
the
map
logk
does
not
extend,
in
any
natural
×
way,
to
a
map
F
→
F
[cf.
Remark
5.4.1],
it
does
extend
to
the
“disjoint
union
of
the
logk
’s
at
all
the
nonarchimedean
primes
of
F
”
in
a
fashion
that
is
Galoisequivariant
[i.e.,
GF
-equivariant]
with
respect
to
the
natural
action
of
GF
on
the
×
resulting
disjoint
unions
of
the
various
k
⊆
k.
Contemplation
of
the
elementary
observations
made
above
led
the
author
to
the
following
point
of
view:
The
fundamental
geometric
framework
in
which
the
logarithm
operation
should
be
understood
is
not
the
ring-theoretic
framework
of
scheme
theory,
but
rather
a
geometric
framework
based
solely
on
the
abstract
proﬁnite
groups
Gk
,
GF
[i.e.,
the
Galois
groups
involved],
i.e.,
a
framework
which
satisﬁes
the
key
property
of
being
“immune”
to
the
operation
of
applying
the
logarithm.
Such
a
group-theoretic
geometric
framework
is
precisely
what
is
furnished
by
the
enhancement
of
absolute
anabelian
geometry
—
which
we
shall
refer
to
as
monoanabelian
geometry
—
that
is
developed
in
the
present
paper.
This
enhancement
may
be
thought
of
as
a
natural
outgrowth
of
the
algorithmbased
approach
to
absolute
anabelian
geometry,
which
forms
the
unifying
theme
[cf.
the
Introductions
to
[Mzk20],
[Mzk21]]
of
the
three-part
series
of
which
the
present
paper
constitutes
the
third,
and
ﬁnal,
part.
From
the
point
of
view
of
the
present
paper,
certain
portions
of
the
theory
and
results
developed
in
earlier
papers
of
the
present
series
—
most
notably,
the
theory
of
Belyi
cuspidalizations
developed
in
TOPICS

[Mzk21],

—
are
relevant
to
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
partly
because
of
their
logical
necessity
in
the
proofs,
and
partly
because
of
their
philosophical
relevance
[cf.,
especially,
the
discussion
of
“hidden
endomorphisms”
in
the
Introduction
to
[Mzk21];
the
theory
of
[Mzk21],
§2].
Note
that
a
ring
may
be
thought
of
as
a
mathematical
object
that
consists
of
“two
combinatorial
dimensions”,
corresponding
to
its
additive
structure,
which
we
shall
denote
by
the
symbol
,
and
its
multiplicative
structure,
which
we
shall
denote
by
the
symbol

[cf.
Remark
5.6.1,
(i),
for
more
details].
One
way
to
understand
the
failure
of
the
logarithm
to
be
compatible
with
the
ring
structures
involved
is
as
a
manifestation
of
the
fact
that
the
logarithm
has
the
eﬀect
of
“tinkering
with,
or
dismantling,
this
two-dimensional
structure”.
Such
a
dismantling
operation
cannot
be
understood
within
the
framework
of
ring
[or
scheme]
theory.
That
is
to
say,
it
may
only
be
understood
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
geometric
framework
that
“lies
essentially
outside”,
or
“is
neutral
with
respect
to”,
this
two-dimensional
structure
[cf.
the
illustration
of
Remark
5.10.2,
(iii)].
One
important
property
of
the
p-adic
logarithm
logk
discussed
above
is
that
the
image
logk
(Ok×
)
⊆
k
—
which
is
compact
—
may
be
thought
of
as
deﬁning
a
sort
of
canonical
rigid
integral
structure
on
k.
In
the
present
paper,
we
shall
refer
to
the
“canonical
rigid
integral
structures”
obtained
in
this
way
as
log-shells.
Note
that
the
image
logk
(k
×
)
of
k
×
via
logk
is,
like
logk
(Ok×
)
[but
unlike
k
×
!],
compact.
That
is
to
say,
the
operation
of
applying
the
p-adic
logarithm
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“compression”
operation
that
exhibits
the
“mass”
represented
by
its
domain
as
a
“somewhat
smaller
collection
of
mass”
than
the
“mass”
represented
by
its
codomain.
In
this
sense,
the
p-adic
logarithm
is
reminiscent
of
the
Frobenius
morphism
in
positive
characteristic
[cf.
Remark
3.6.2
for
more
details].
In
particular,
this
“compressing
nature”
of
the
p-adic
logarithm
may
be
thought
of
as
being
one
that
lies
in
sharp
contrast
with
the
nature
of
an
étale
morphism.
This
point
of
view
is
reminiscent
of
the
discussion
of
the
“fundamental
dichotomy”
between
“Frobeniuslike”
and
“étale-like”
structures
in
the
Introduction
of
[Mzk16].
In
the
classical
p-adic
theory,
the
notion
of
a
Frobenius
lifting
[cf.
the
theory
of
[Mzk1],
[Mzk4]]
may
be
thought
of
as
forming
a
bridge
between
the
two
sides
of
this
dichotomy
[cf.
the
discussion
of
mono-theta
environments
in
the
Introduction
to
[Mzk18]!]
—
that
is
to
say,
a
Frobenius
lifting
is,
on
the
one
hand,
literally
a
lifting
of
the
Frobenius
morphism
in
positive
characteristic
and,
on
the
other
hand,
tends
to
satisfy
the
property
of
being
étale
in
characteristic
zero,
i.e.,
of
inducing
an
isomorphism
on
diﬀerentials,
once
one
divides
by
p.
In
a
word,
the
theory
developed
in
the
present
paper
may
be
summarized
as
follows:
The
thrust
of
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
lies
in
the
development
of
a
formalism,
via
the
use
of
ring/scheme
structures
reconstructed
via
monoanabelian
geometry,
in
which
the
“dismantling/compressing
nature”
of
the
logarithm
operation
discussed
above
[cf.
the
Frobenius
morphism
in
positive
characteristic]
is
“reorganized”
in
an
abstract
combinatorial
fashion
4

MOCHIZUKI
that
exhibits
the
logarithm
as
a
global
operation
on
a
number
ﬁeld
which,
moreover,
is
a
sort
of
“isomomorphism
up
to
an
appropriate
renormalization
operation”
[cf.
the
isomorphism
induced
on
diﬀerentials
by
a
Frobenius
lifting,
once
one
divides
by
p].
One
important
aspect
of
this
theory
is
the
analogy
between
this
theory
and
[the
positive
characteristic
portion
of]
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
[cf.
§I5
below],
in
which
the
“naive
pull-back”
of
an
indigenous
bundle
by
Frobenius
never
yields
a
bundle
isomorphic
to
the
original
indigenous
bundle,
but
the
“renormalized
Frobenius
pull-back”
does,
in
certain
cases,
allow
one
to
obtain
an
output
bundle
that
is
isomorphic
to
the
original
input
bundle.
At
a
more
detailed
level,
the
main
results
of
the
present
paper
may
be
summarized
as
follows:
In
§1,
we
develop
the
absolute
anabelian
algorithms
that
will
be
necessary
in
our
theory.
In
particular,
we
obtain
a
semi-absolute
group-theoretic
reconstruction
algorithm
[cf.
Theorem
1.9,
Corollary
1.10]
for
hyperbolic
orbicurves
of
strictly
Belyi
type
[cf.
[Mzk21],
Deﬁnition
3.5]
over
sub-p-adic
ﬁelds
—
i.e.,
such
as
number
ﬁelds
and
nonarchimedean
completions
of
number
ﬁelds
—
that
is
functorial
with
respect
to
base-change
of
the
base
ﬁeld.
Moreover,
we
observe
that
the
only
“non-elementary”
ingredient
of
these
algorithms
is
the
technique
of
Belyi
cuspidalization
developed
in
[Mzk21],
§3,
which
depends
on
the
main
results
of
[Mzk5]
[cf.
Remark
1.11.3].
If
one
eliminates
this
non-elementary
ingredient
from
these
algorithms,
then,
in
the
case
of
function
ﬁelds,
one
obtains
a
very
elementary
semi-absolute
group-theoretic
reconstruction
algorithm
[cf.
Theorem
1.11],
which
is
valid
over
somewhat
more
general
base
ﬁelds,
namely
base
ﬁelds
which
are
“Kummer-faithful”
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.5].
The
results
of
§1
are
of
interest
as
anabelian
results
in
their
own
right,
independent
of
the
theory
of
later
portions
of
the
present
paper.
For
instance,
it
is
hoped
that
elementary
results
such
as
Theorem
1.11
may
be
of
use
in
introductions
to
anabelian
geometry
for
advanced
undergraduates
or
non-specialists
[cf.
[Mzk8],
§1].
In
§2,
we
develop
an
archimedean
—
i.e.,
complex
analytic
—
analogue
of
the
theory
of
§1.
One
important
theme
in
this
theory
is
the
deﬁnition
of
“archimedean
structures”
which,
like
proﬁnite
Galois
groups,
are
“immune
to
the
ring
structuredismantling
and
compressing
nature
of
the
logarithm”.
For
instance,
the
notion
that
constitutes
the
archimedean
counterpart
to
the
notion
of
a
proﬁnite
Galois
group
is
the
notion
of
an
Aut-holomorphic
structure
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.1;
Proposition
2.2;
Corollary
2.3],
which
was
motivated
by
the
category-theoretic
approach
to
holomorphic
structures
via
the
use
of
the
topological
group
SL2
(R)
given
in
[Mzk14],
§1.
In
this
context,
one
central
fact
is
the
rather
elementary
observation
that
the
group
of
holomorphic
or
anti-holomorphic
automorphisms
of
the
unit
disc
in
the
complex
plane
is
commensurably
terminal
[cf.
[Mzk20],
§0]
in
the
group
of
self-homeomorphisms
of
the
unit
disc
[cf.
Proposition
2.2,
(ii)].
We
also
give
an
“algorithmic
reﬁnement”
of
the
“parallelograms,
rectangles,
squares
approach”
of
[Mzk14],
§2
[cf.
Propositions
2.5,
2.6].
By
combining
these
two
approaches
and
applying
the
technique
of
elliptic
cuspidalization
developed
in
[Mzk21],
§3,
we
obtain
a
certain
reconstruction
algorithm
[cf.
Corollary
2.7]
for
the
“local
linear
holomorphic
structure”
of
an
Aut-holomorphic
orbispace
arising
from
an
elliptically
admissible
[cf.
[Mzk21],
Deﬁnition
3.1]
hyperbolic
orbicurve,
which
is

compatible
with
the
global
portion
of
the
Galois-theoretic
theory
of
§1
[cf.
Corollaries
2.8,
2.9].
In
§3,
§4,
we
develop
the
category-theoretic
formalism
—
centering
around
the
notions
of
observables,
telecores,
and
cores
[cf.
Deﬁnition
3.5]
—
that
are
applied
to
express
the
compatibility
of
the
“mono-anabelian”
construction
algorithms
of
§1
[cf.
Corollary
3.6]
and
§2
[cf.
Corollary
4.5]
with
the
“log-Frobenius
functor
log”
[in
essence,
a
version
of
the
usual
“logarithm”
at
the
various
nonarchimedean
and
archimedean
primes
of
a
number
ﬁeld].
We
also
study
the
failure
of
log-Frobenius
compatibility
that
occurs
if
one
attempts
to
take
the
“conventional
anabelian”
—
which
we
shall
refer
to
as
“bi-anabelian”
—
approach
to
the
situation
[cf.
Corollary
3.7].
Finally,
in
the
remarks
following
Corollaries
3.6,
3.7,
we
discuss
in
detail
the
meaning
of
the
various
new
category-theoretic
notions
that
are
introduced,
as
well
as
the
various
aspects
of
the
analogy
between
these
notions,
in
the
context
of
Corollaries
3.6,
3.7,
and
the
classical
p-adic
theory
of
the
MF
∇
-objects
of
[Falt].
In
§5,
we
develop
a
global
formalism
over
number
ﬁelds
in
which
we
study
the
canonical
rigid
integral
structures
—
i.e.,
log-shells
—
that
are
obtained
by
applying
the
log-Frobenius
compatibility
discussed
in
§3,
§4.
These
log-shells
satisfy
the
following
important
properties:
(L1)
a
log-shell
is
compact
and
hence
of
ﬁnite
“log-volume”
[cf.
Corollary
5.10,
(i)];
(L2)
the
log-volumes
of
(L1)
are
compatible
with
application
of
the
logFrobenius
functor
[cf.
Corollary
5.10,
(ii)];
(L3)
log-shells
are
compatible
with
the
operation
of
“panalocalization”,
i.e.,
the
operation
of
restricting
to
the
disjoint
union
of
the
various
primes
of
a
number
ﬁeld
in
such
a
way
that
one
“forgets”
the
global
structure
of
the
number
ﬁeld
[cf.
Corollary
5.5;
Corollary
5.10,
(iii)];
(L4)
log-shells
are
compatible
with
the
operation
of
“mono-analyticization”,
i.e.,
the
operation
of
“disabling
the
rigidity”
of
one
of
the
“two
combinatorial
dimensions”
of
a
ring,
an
operation
that
corresponds
to
allowing
“Teichmüller
dilations”
in
complex
and
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
[cf.
Corollary
5.10,
(iv)].
In
particular,
we
note
that
property
(L3)
may
be
thought
of
as
a
rigidity
property
for
certain
global
arithmetic
line
bundles
[more
precisely,
the
trivial
arithmetic
line
bundle
—
cf.
Remarks
5.4.2,
5.4.3]
that
is
analogous
to
the
very
strong
—
i.e.,
by
comparison
to
the
behavior
of
arbitrary
vector
bundles
on
a
curve
—
rigidity
properties
satisﬁed
by
MF
∇
-objects
with
respect
to
Zariski
localization.
Such
rigidity
properties
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“freezing
of
integral
structures”
with
respect
to
Zariski
localization
[cf.
Remark
5.10.2,
(i)].
Finally,
we
discuss
in
some
detail
[cf.
Remark
5.10.3]
the
analogy
—
centering
around
the

Finally,

the

well-known

of

with
complex
multiplication
[cf.,
e.g.,
[LangCM],
[Milne-CM],
for
more

that
underlies
the
observation
“(∗CM
)”
related
to
the
author
by
A.
Tamagawa
[cf.
[Mzk20],
Remark
3.8.1].
In
particular,
we
verify
that
this
observation
(∗CM
)
does
indeed
hold.
This
implies
that
the
observation
“(∗A-qLT
)”
discussed
in
[Mzk20],
Remark
3.8.1,
also
holds,
and
hence,
in
particular,
that
the
hypothesis
of
[Mzk20],
Corollary

to
the
eﬀect
that
“either
(∗A-qLT

or
(∗CM

holds”
may
be
eliminated
[i.e.,
that
[Mzk20],
Corollary
3.9,
holds
unconditionally].
Although

Fundamental
Naive
Questions
Concerning
Anabelian
Geometry
One
interesting
aspect
of
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
is
that
it
is
intimately
related
to
various
fundamental
questions
concerning
anabelian
geometry
that
are
frequently
posed
by
newcomers
to
the
subject.
Typical
examples
of
these
fundamental
questions
are
the
following:
(Q1)
Why
is
it
useful
or
meaningful
to
study
anabelian
geometry
in
the
ﬁrst
place?
(Q2)
What
exactly
is
meant
by
the
term
“group-theoretic
reconstruction”
in
discussions
of
anabelian
geometry?
(Q3)
What
is
the
signiﬁcance
of
studying
anabelian
geometry
over
mixedcharacteristic
local
ﬁelds
[i.e.,
p-adic
local
ﬁelds]
as
opposed
to
number
ﬁelds?
(Q4)
Why
is
birational
anabelian
geometry
insuﬃcient
—
i.e.,
what
is
the
signiﬁcance
of
studying
the
anabelian
geometry
of
hyperbolic
curves,
as
opposed
to
their
function
ﬁelds?
In
fact,
the
answers
to
these
questions
that
are
furnished
by
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
are
closely
related.
As
was
discussed
in
§I1,
the
answer
to
(Q1),
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
present
paper,
is
that
anabelian
geometry
—
more
speciﬁcally,
“mono-anabelian
geometry”
—
provides
a
framework
that
is
suﬃciently
well-endowed
as
to
contain
“data
reminiscent
of
the
data
constituted
by
various
scheme-theoretic
structures”,
but
has
the
virtue
of
being
based
not
on
ring
structures,
but
rather
on
proﬁnite
[Galois]
groups,
which
are
“neutral”
with
respect
to
the
operation
of
taking
the
logarithm.
TOPICS
IN
ABSOLUTE
ANABELIAN
GEOMETRY
III

The
answer
to
(Q2)
is
related
to
the
algorithmic
approach
to
absolute
anabelian
geometry
taken
in
the
present
three-part
series
[cf.
the
Introduction
to
[Mzk20]].
That
is
to
say,
typically,
in
discussions
concerning
“Grothendieck
Conjecture-type
fully
faithfulness
results”
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk5]]
the
term
“group-theoretic
reconstruction”
is
deﬁned
simply
to
mean
“preserved
by
an
arbitrary
isomorphism
between
the
étale
fundamental
groups
of
the
two
schemes
under
consideration”.
This
point
of
view
will
be
referred
to
in
the
present
paper
as
“bi-anabelian”.
By
contrast,
the
algorithmic
approach
to
absolute
anabelian
geometry
involves
the
development
of
“software”
whose
input
data
consists
solely
of,
for
instance,
a
single
abstract
proﬁnite
group
[that
just
happens
to
be
isomorphic
to
the
étale
fundamental
group
of
a
scheme],
and
whose
output
data
consists
of
various
structures
reminiscent
of
scheme
theory
[cf.
the
Introduction
to
[Mzk20]].
This
point
of
view
will
be
referred
to
in
the
present
paper
as
“mono-anabelian”.
Here,
the
mono-anabelian
“software”
is
required
to
be
functorial,
e.g.,
with
respect
to
isomorphisms
of
proﬁnite
groups.
Thus,
it
follows
formally
that
“mono-anabelian”
=⇒
“bi-anabelian”
[cf.
Remark
1.9.8].
On
the
other
hand,
although
it
is
diﬃcult
to
formulate
such
issues
completely
precisely,
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
[cf.,
especially,
§3]
suggests
strongly
that
the
opposite
implication
should
be
regarded
as
false.
That
is
to
say,
whereas
the
mono-anabelian
approach
yields
a
framework
that
is
“neutral”
with
respect
to
the
operation
of
taking
the
logarithm,
the
bi-anabelian
approach
fails
to
yield
such
a
framework
[cf.
Corollaries
3.6,
3.7,
and
the
following
remarks;
§I4
below].
Here,
we
pause
to
remark
that,
in
fact,
although,
historically
speaking,
many
theorems
were
originally
formulated
in
a
“bi-anabelian”
fashion,
careful
inspection
of
their
proofs
typically
leads
to
the
recovery
of
“mono-anabelian
algorithms”.
Nevertheless,
since
formulating
theorems
in
a
“mono-anabelian”
fashion,
as
we
have
attempted
to
do
in
the
present
paper
[and
more
generally
in
the
present
three-part
series,
but
cf.
the
ﬁnal
portion
of
the
Introduction
to
[Mzk21]],
can
be
quite
cumbersome
—
and
indeed
is
one
of
the
main
reasons
for
the
unfortunately
lengthy
nature
of
the
present
paper!
—
it
is
often
convenient
to
formulate
ﬁnal
theorems
in
a
“bianabelian”
fashion.
On
the
other
hand,
we
note
that
the
famous
Neukirch-Uchida
theorem
on
the
anabelian
nature
of
number
ﬁelds
appears
to
be
one
important
counterexample
to
the
above
remark.
That
is
to
say,
to
the
author’s
knowledge,
proofs
of
this
result
never
yield
“explicit
mono-anabelian
reconstruction
algorithms
of
the
given
number
ﬁeld”;
by
contrast,
Theorem
1.9
of
the
present
paper
does
give
such
an
explicit
construction
of
the
“given
number
ﬁeld”
[cf.
Remark
1.9.5].
Another
interesting
aspect
of
the
algorithmic
approach
to
anabelian
geometry
is
that
one
may
think
of
the
“software”
constituted
by
such
algorithms
as
a
sort
of
“combinatorialization”
of
the
original
schemes
[cf.
Remark
1.9.7].
This
point
of
view
is
reminiscent
of
the
operation
of
passing
from
a
“scheme-theoretic”
MF
∇
object
to
an
associated
Galois
representation,
as
well
as
the
general
theme
in
various
papers
of
the
author
concerning
a
“category-theoretic
approach
to
scheme
theory”
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk13],
[Mzk14],
[Mzk16],
[Mzk17],
[Mzk18]]
of
“extracting
from
schemetheoretic
arithmetic
geometry
the
abstract
combinatorial
patterns
that
underlie
the
scheme
theory”.
8
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
The
answer
to
(Q3)
provided
by
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
is
that
the
absolute
p-adic
[mono-]anabelian
results
of
§1
underlie
the
panalocalizability
of
log-shells
discussed
in
§I1
[cf.
property
(L3)].
Put
another
way,
these
results
imply
that
the
“geometric
framework
immune
to
the
application
of
the
logarithm”
—
i.e.,
immune
to
the
dismantling
of
the
“”
and
“”
dimensions
of
a
ring
—
discussed
in
§I1
may
be
applied
locally
at
each
prime
of
a
number
ﬁeld
regarded
as
an
isolated
entity,
i.e.,
without
making
use
of
the
global
structure
of
the
number
ﬁeld
—
cf.
the
discussion
of
“freezing
of
integral
structures”
with
respect
to
Zariski
localization
in
Remark
5.10.2,
(i).
For
more
on
the
signiﬁcance
of
the
operation
of
passing
“

”
in
the
context
of
nonarchimedean
log-shells
—
i.e.,
the
operation
of
passing
“Ok×

logk
(Ok×
)”
—
we
refer
to
the
discussion
of
nonarchimedean
log-shells
in
§I3
below.
The
answer
to
(Q4)
furnished
by
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
[cf.
Remark
1.11.4]
—
i.e.,
one
fundamental
diﬀerence
between
birational
anabelian
geometry
and
the
anabelian
geometry
of
hyperbolic
curves
—
is
that
[unlike
spectra
of
function
ﬁelds!]
“most”
hyperbolic
curves
admit
“cores”
[in
the
sense
of
[Mzk3],
§3;
[Mzk10],
§2],
which
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
abstract
“covering-theoretic”
analogue
[cf.
Remark
1.11.4,
(ii)]
of
the
notion
of
a
“canonical
rigid
integral
structure”
[cf.
the
discussion
of
log-shells
in
§I1].
Moreover,
if
one
attempts
to
work
with
the
Galois
group
of
a
function
ﬁeld
supplemented
by
some
additional
structure
such
as
the
set
of
cusps
—
arising
from
scheme
theory!
—
that
determines
a
hyperbolic
curve
structure,
then
one
must
sacriﬁce
the
crucial
mono-anabelian
nature
of
one’s
reconstruction
algorithms
[cf.
Remarks
1.11.5;
3.7.7,
(ii)].
Finally,
we
observe
that
there
certainly
exist
many
“fundamental
naive
questions”
concerning
anabelian
geometry
for
which
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
does
not
furnish
any
answers.
Typical
examples
of
such
fundamental
questions
are
the
following:
(Q5)
What
is
the
signiﬁcance
of
studying
the
anabelian
geometry
of
proper
hyperbolic
curves,
as
opposed
to
aﬃne
hyperbolic
curves?
(Q6)
What
is
the
signiﬁcance
of
studying
pro-Σ
[where
Σ
is
some
nonempty
set
of
prime
numbers]
anabelian
geometry,
as
opposed
to
proﬁnite
anabelian
geometry
[cf.,
e.g.,
Remark
3.7.6
for
a
discussion
of
why
pro-Σ
anabelian
geometry
is
ill-suited
to
the
needs
of
the
theory
of
the
present
paper]?
(Q7)
What
is
the
signiﬁcance
of
studying
anabelian
geometry
in
positive
characteristic,
e.g.,
over
ﬁnite
ﬁelds?
It
would
certainly
be
of
interest
if
further
developments
could
shed
light
on
these
questions.
§I3.
Dismantling
the
Two
Combinatorial
Dimensions
of
a
Ring
As
was
discussed
in
§I1,
a
ring
may
be
thought
of
as
a
mathematical
object
that
consists
of
“two
combinatorial
dimensions”,
corresponding
to
its
additive
structure

and
its
multiplicative
structure

[cf.
Remark
5.6.1,
(i)].
When
the
ring
under
consideration
is
a
[say,
for
simplicity,
totally
imaginary]
number
ﬁeld
F
or
TOPICS
IN
ABSOLUTE
ANABELIAN
GEOMETRY
III
9
a
mixed-characteristic
nonarchimedean
local
ﬁeld
k,
these
two
combinatorial
dimensions
may
also
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
the
two
cohomological
dimensions
of
the
absolute
Galois
groups
GF
,
Gk
of
F
,
k
[cf.
[NSW],
Proposition
8.3.17;
[NSW],
Theorem
7.1.8,
(i)].
In
a
similar
vein,
when
the
ring
under
consideration
is
a
complex
archimedean
ﬁeld
k
(∼
=
C),
then
the
two
combinatorial
dimensions
of
k
may
also
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
the
two
topological
—
i.e.,
real
—
dimensions
of
the
underlying
topological
space
of
the
topological
group
k
×
.
Note
that
in
the
case
where
the
local
ﬁeld
k
is
nonarchimedean
(respectively,
archimedean),
precisely
one
of
the
two
cohomological
(respectively,
real)
dimensions
of
Gk
(respectively,
k
×
)
—
namely,
the
dimension
corresponding
to
the

·
Fr
[generated
by
the
Frobenius
element]
(remaximal
unramiﬁed
quotient
Gk

Z
spectively,
the
topological
subgroup
of
units
S1
∼
=
Ok×
⊆
k
×
)
is
rigid
with
respect
to,
say,
automorphisms
of
the
topological
group
Gk
(respectively,
k
×
),
while
the
other
dimension
—
namely,
the
dimension
corresponding
to
the
inertia
subgroup
Ik
⊆
Gk
(respectively,
the
value
group
k
×

R>0
)
—
is
not
rigid
[cf.
Remark
1.9.4].
[In
the
nonarchimedean
case,
this
phenomenon
is
discussed
in
more
detail
in
[NSW],
the
Closing
Remark
preceding
Theorem
12.2.7.]
Thus,
each
of
the
various
nonarchimedean
“Gk
’s”
and
archimedean
“k
×
’s”
that
arise
at
the
various
primes
of
a
number
ﬁeld
may
be
thought
of
as
being
a
sort
of
“arithmetic
Gm
”
—
i.e.,
an
abstract
arithmetic
“cylinder”
—
that
decomposes
into
a
[twisted]
product
of

·
Fr,
k
×

R>0
]
“units”
[i.e.,
Ik
⊆
Gk
,
Ok×
⊆
k
×
]
and
value
group
[i.e.,
Gk


⎟
⎠

with
the
property
that
one
of
these
two
factors
is
rigid,
while
the
other
is
not.
Here,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
correspondence
between
units/value
group
and
rigid/non-rigid
diﬀers
[i.e.,
“goes
in
the
opposite
direction”]
in
the
nonarchimedean
and
archimedean
cases.
This
phenomenon
is
reminiscent
of
the
product
formula
in
elementary
number
theory,
as
well
as
of
the
behavior
of
the
log-Frobenius
functor
log
at
nonarchimedean
versus
archimedean
primes
[cf.
Remark
4.5.2;
the
discussion
of
log-shells
in
the
ﬁnal
portion
of
the
present
§I3].

On
the
other
hand,
the

of
the
topological
group
obtained
as
the
image
of
the
non-rigid
portion
Ik
in
the
abelianization
Gab
k
of
Gk
is
naturally
isomorphic,
by
local
class
ﬁeld
theory,
to
k.
Moreover,
by
the
theory
of
[Mzk2],
the
10
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
decomposition
of
this
copy
of
k
[i.e.,
into
sets
of
elements
with
some
given
p-adic
valuation]
determined
by
the
p-adic
valuation
on
k
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
the
ramiﬁcation
ﬁltration
on
Gk
and
is
precisely
the
data
that
is
“deformed”
by
automorphisms
of
k
that
do
not
arise
from
ﬁeld
automorphisms.
That
is
to
say,
this
aspect
of
the
non-rigidity
of
Gk
is
quite
reminiscent
of
the
non-rigidity
of
the
topological
group
R>0
[i.e.,
of
the
non-rigidity
of
the
structure
on
this
topological
group
arising
from
the
usual
archimedean
valuation
on
R,
which
determines
an
isomorphism
between
this
topological
group
and
some
“ﬁxed,
standard
copy”
of
R>0
].
In
this
context,
one
of
the
ﬁrst
important
points
of
the
“mono-anabelian
theory”
of
§1,
§2
of
the
present
paper
is
that
if
one
supplements
a(n)
nonarchimedean
Gk
(respectively,
archimedean
k
×
)
with
the
data
arising
from
a
hyperbolic
orbicurve
[which
satisﬁes
certain
properties
—
cf.
Corollaries
1.10,
2.7],
then
this
supplementary
data
has
the
eﬀect
of
rigidifying
both
dimensions
of
Gk
(respectively,
k
×
).
In
the
case
of
[a
nonarchimedean]
Gk
,
this
data
consists
of
the
outer
action
of
Gk
on
the
proﬁnite
geometric
fundamental
group
of
the
hyperbolic
orbicurve;
in
the
case
of
[an
archimedean]
k
×
,
this
data
consists,
in
essence,
of
the
various
local
actions
of
open
neighborhoods
of
the
origin
of
k
×
on
the
squares
or
rectangles
[that
lie
in
the
underlying
topological
[orbi]space
of
the
Riemann
[orbi]surface
determined
by
the
hyperbolic
[orbi]curve]
that
encode
the
holomorphic
structure
of
the
Riemann
[orbi]surface
[cf.
the
theory
of
[Mzk14],
§2].
Here,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
these
“rigidifying
actions”
are
reminiscent
of
the
discussion
of
“hidden
endomorphisms”
in
the
Introduction
to
[Mzk21],
as
well
as
of
the

On
the
other
hand,
if
one
exits
such
a
“zone
of
arithmetic
holomorphy”
—
an
operation
that
we
shall
refer
to
as
mono-analyticization
—
then
a
nonarchimedean
Gk
or
an
archimedean
k
×
is
stripped
of
the
rigidity
imparted
by
the
above
rigidifying
actions,
hence
may
be
thought
of
as
being
subject
to
Teichmüller
dilations
[cf.
Remark
5.10.2,
(ii),
(iii)].
Indeed,
this
is
intuitively
evident
in
the
archimedean
case,
in
which
the
quotient
k
×

R>0
is
subject
[i.e.,
upon
monoanalyticization,
so
k
×
is
only
considered
as
a
topological
group]
to
automorphisms
x

xλ

for
λ

If,
moreover,
one
thinks
of
of
the
form

the

groups
of
archimedean
and
nonarchimedean
primes
as
being
“synchronized”
[so
as
to
keep
from
violating
the
product
formula
—
which
plays
a
crucial
role
in
the
theory
of
“heights”,
i.e.,
degrees
of
global
arithmetic
line
bundles],
then
the
operation
of
mono-analyticization
necessarily
results
in
analogous
“Teichmüller
dilations”
at
nonarchimedean
primes.
In
the
context
of
the
theory
of
Frobenioids,
such
Teichmüller
dilations
[whether
archimedean
or
nonarchimedean]
correspond
to
the
unit-linear
Frobenius
functor
studied
in
[Mzk16],
Proposition

Note
that
the
“non-linear

the

are
reminiscent
of
the

if

as
developed
in

12
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
Next,
we
consider
the
eﬀect
on
log-shells
of
the
operation
of
mono-analyticization.
In
the
nonarchimedean
case,
logk
(Ok×
)
∼
=
Ok×
/(torsion)
may
be
reconstructed
group-theoretically
from
Gk
as
the
quotient
by
torsion
of
the
image
of
Ik
in
the
abelianization
Gab
k
[cf.
Proposition
5.8,
(i),
(ii)];
a
similar
construction
may
be
applied
to
ﬁnite
extensions
⊆
k
of
k.
Moreover,
this
construction
involves
only
the
group
of
units
Ok×
[i.e.,
it
does
not
involve
the
value
groups,
which,
as
discussed
above,
are
subject
to
Teichmüller
dilations],
hence
is
compatible
with
the
operation
of
mono-analyticization.
Thus,
this
construction
yields
a
canonical
rigid
integral
structure,
i.e.,
in
the
form
of
the
topological
module
logk
(Ok×
),
which
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
approximation
of
some
nonarchimedean
localization
of
the
trivial
global
arithmetic
line
bundle
[cf.
Remarks
5.4.2,
5.4.3]
that
is
achieved
without
the
use
of
[the
two
combinatorial
dimensions
of]
the
ring
structure
on
Ok
.
Note,
moreover,
that
the
ring
structure
on
the
perfection
logk
(Ok×
)pf
[i.e.,
in
eﬀect,
“logk
(Ok×
)
⊗
Q”]
of
this
module
is
obliterated
by
the
operation
of
mono-analyticization.
That
is
to
say,
this
ring
structure
is
only
accessible
within
a
“zone
of
arithmetic
holomorphy”
[as
discussed
above].
On
the
other
hand,
if
one
returns
to
such
a
zone
of
arithmetic
holomorphy
to
avail
oneself
of
the
ring
structure
on
logk
(Ok×
)pf
,
then
applying
the
operation
of
mono-analyticization
amounts
to
applying
the
construction
discussed
above
to
the
group
of
units
of
logk
(Ok×
)pf
[equipped
with
the
ring
structure
furnished
by
the
zone
of
arithmetic
holomorphy
under
consideration].
That
is
to
say,
the
freedom
to
execute,
at
will,
both
the
operations
of
exiting
and
re-entering
zones
of
arithmetic
holomorphy
is
inextricably
linked
to
the
“juggling
of
,
”
via
log
[cf.
Remark
5.10.2,
(ii),
(iii)].
In
the
archimedean
case,
if
one
writes
log(Ok×
)

Ok×
for
the
universal
covering
topological
group
of
Ok×
[i.e.,
in
essence,
the
exponential
map
“2πi
·
R

S1
”],
then
the
surjection
log(Ok×
)

Ok×
determines
on
log(Ok×
)
a
“canonical
rigid
line
segment
of
length
2π”.
Thus,
if
one
writes
k
=
k
im
×
k
rl
for
the
product
decomposition
of
the
additive
topological
group
k
into
imaginary
[i.e.,
“i
·
R”]
and
real
[ı.e.,
“R”]
parts,
then
we
obtain
a
natural
isometry
∼
log(Ok×
)
×
log(Ok×
)
→
k
im
×
k
rl
=
k
[i.e.,
the
product
of
the
identity
isomorphism
2πi
·
R
=
i
·
R
and
the
isomorphism
∼
2πi
·
R
→
R
given
by
dividing
by
±i]
which
is
well-deﬁned
up
to
multiplication
by
±1
on
the
second
factors
[cf.
Deﬁnition
5.6,
(iv);
Proposition
5.8,
(iv),
(v)].
In
particular,
“log(Ok×
)
×
log(Ok×
)”
may
be
regarded
as
a
construction,
based
on
the
“rigid”
topological
group
Ok×
[which
is
not
subject
to
Teichmüller
dilations!],
of
a
canonical
rigid
integral
structure
[determined
by
the
canonical
rigid
line
segments
discussed
above]
that
serves
as
an
approximation
of
some
archimedean
localization
of
the
trivial
global
arithmetic
line
bundle
and,
moreover,
is
compatible
with
the
operation
of
mono-analyticization
[cf.
the
nonarchimedean
case].
On

other
hand,
[as
might
be
expected
by
comparison
to
the
nonarchimedean
case]
once
one
exits
a
zone
of
arithmetic
holomorphy,
the
±1-indeterminacy
that
occurs
in
the
above
natural
isometry
has
the
eﬀect
of
obstructing
any
attempts
to
transport
the
ring
structure
of
k
via
this
natural
isometry
so
as
to
obtain
a
structure
of
complex
archimedean
ﬁeld
on
log(Ok×
)
×
log(Ok×
)
[cf.
Remark
5.8.1].
Finally,
just
as
in
the
nonarchimedean
case,
the
freedom
to
execute,
at
will,
both
the
operations
of
exiting
and
re-entering
zones
of
arithmetic
holomorphy
is
inextricably
linked
to
the
“juggling
of
,
”
via
log
[cf.
Remark
5.10.2,
(ii),
(iii)]
—
a
phenomenon
that
is
strongly
reminiscent
of
the
crucial
role
played
by
rotations
in
the
theory
of
mono-analyticizations
of
archimedean
log-shells
[cf.
Remark
5.8.1].
§I4.
Mono-anabelian
Log-Frobenius
Compatibility
Within
each
zone
of
arithmetic
holomorphy,
one
wishes
to
apply
the
logFrobenius
functor
log.
As
discussed
in
§I1,
log
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“wall”
that
may
be
penetrated
by
such
“elementary
combinatorial/topological
objects”
as
Galois
groups
[in
the
nonarchimedean
case]
or
underlying
topological
spaces
[in
the
archimedean
case],
but
not
by
rings
or
functions
[cf.
Remark
3.7.7].
This
situation
suggests
a
possible
analogy
with
ideas
from
physics
in
which
“étale-like”
structures
[cf.
the
Introduction
of
[Mzk16]],
which
can
penetrate
the
log-wall,
are
regarded
as
“massless”,
like
light,
while
“Frobenius-like”
structures
[cf.
the
Introduction
of
[Mzk16]],
which
cannot
penetrate
the
log-wall,
are
regarded
as
being
of
“positive
mass”,
like
ordinary
matter
[cf.
Remark
3.7.5,
(iii)].

In
the
archimedean
case,
since
topological
spaces
alone
are
not
suﬃcient
to
transport
“holomorphic
structures”
in
the
usual
sense,
we
take
the
approach
in
§2
of
considering
“Aut-holomorphic
spaces”,
i.e.,
underlying
topological
spaces
of
Riemann
surfaces
equipped
with
the
additional
data
of
a
group
of
“special
self-homeomorphisms”
[i.e.,
bi-holomorphic
automorphisms]
of
each
[suﬃciently
small]
open
connected
subset
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.1,
(i)].
The
point
here
is
to
“somehow
encode
the
usual
notion
of
a
holomorphic
structure”
in
such
a
way
that
one
does
not
need
to
resort
to
the
use
of
“ﬁxed
reference
models”
of
the
ﬁeld
of
complex
numbers
C
[as
is
done
in
the
conventional
deﬁnition
of
a
holomorphic
structure,
which
consists
of
local
comparison
to
such
a
ﬁxed
reference
model
of
C],
since
such
models
of
C
fail
to
be
“immune”
to
the
application
of
log
—
cf.
Remarks
2.1.2,
2.7.4.
This
situation
is
very
much
an
archimedean
analogue
of
the
distinction
between
monoanabelian
and
bi-anabelian
geometry.
That
is
to
say,
if
one
thinks
of
one
of
the
14
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
two
schemes
that
occur
in
bi-anabelian
comparison
results
as
the
“given
scheme
of
interest”
and
the
other
scheme
as
a
“ﬁxed
reference
model”,
then
although
these
two
schemes
are
related
to
one
another
via
purely
Galois-theoretic
data,
the
scheme
structure
of
the
“scheme
of
interest”
is
reconstructed
from
the
Galois-theoretic
data
by
transporting
the
scheme
structure
of
“model
scheme”,
hence
requires
the
use
of
input
data
[i.e.,
the
scheme
structure
of
the
“model
scheme”]
that
cannot
penetrate
the
log-wall.
In
order
to
formalize
these
ideas
concerning
the
issue
of
distinguishing
between
“model-dependent”,
“bi-anabelian”
approaches
and
“model-independent”,
“monoanabelian”
approaches,
we
take
the
point
of
view,
in
§3,
§4,
of
considering
“series
of
operations”
—
in
the
form
of
diagrams
[parametrized
by
various
oriented
graphs]
of
functors
—
applied
to
various
“types
of
data”
—
in
the
form
of
objects
of
categories
[cf.
Remark
3.6.7].
Although,
by
deﬁnition,
it
is
impossible
to
compare
the
“diﬀerent
types
of
data”
obtained
by
applying
these
various
“operations”,
if
one
considers
“projections”
of
these
operations
between
diﬀerent
types
of
data
onto
morphisms
between
objects
of
a
single
category
[i.e.,
a
single
“type
of
data”],
then
such
comparisons
become
possible.
Such
a
“projection”
is
formalized
in
Deﬁnition
3.5,
(iii),
as
the
notion
of
an
observable.
One
special
type
of
observable
that
is
of
crucial
importance
in
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
is
an
observable
that
“captures
a
certain
portion
of
various
distinct
types
of
data
that
remains
constant,
up
to
isomorphism,
throughout
the
series
of
operations
applied
to
these
distinct
types
of
data”.
Such
an
observable
is
referred
to
as
a
core
[cf.
Deﬁnition
3.5,
(iii)].
Another
important
notion
in
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
is
the
notion
of
telecore
[cf.
Deﬁnition
3.5,
(iv)],
which
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“core
structure
whose
compatibility
apparatus
[i.e.,
‘constant
nature’]
only
goes
into
eﬀect
after
a
certain
time
lag”
[cf.
Remark
3.5.1].
Before
explaining
how
these
notions
are
applied
in
the
situation
over
number
ﬁelds
considered
in
the
present
paper,
it
is
useful
to
consider
the
analogy
between
these
notions
and
the
classical
p-adic
theory.
The
prototype
of
the
notion
of
a
core
is
the
constant
nature
[i.e.,
up
to
equivalence
of
categories]
of
the
étale
site
of
a
scheme
in
positive
characteristic
with
respect
to
the
[operation
constituted
by
the]
Frobenius
morphism.
Put
another
way,
cores
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
the
notion
of
“slope
zero”
Galois
representations
in
the
p-adic
theory.
By
contrast,
telecores
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
the
notion
of
“positive
slope”
in
the
p-adic
theory.
In
particular,
the
“time
lag”
inherent
in
the
compatibility
apparatus
of
a
telecore
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
the
“lag”,
in
terms
of
powers
of
p,
that
occurs
when
one
applies
Hensel’s
lemma
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk21],
Lemma
2.1]
to
lift
solutions,
modulo
various
powers
of
p,
of
a
polynomial
equation
that
gives
rise
to
a
crystalline
Galois
representation
—
e.g.,
arising
from
an
“MF
∇
-object”
of
[Falt]
—
for
which
the
slopes
of
the
Frobenius
action
are
positive
[cf.
Remark
3.6.5
for
more
on
this
topic].
This
formal
analogy
with
the
classical
p-adic
theory
forms
the
starting
point
for
the
analogy
with
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
to
be
discussed
in
§I5
below
[cf.
Remark
3.7.2].

Now
let
us
return
to
the
situation
involving
k,
k,
Gk
,
and
logk
discussed
at
the
beginning
of
§I1.
Suppose
further
that
we
are
given
a
hyperbolic

over
k
as
in
the
discussion
of

whose

and,
moreover,
satisﬁes
the
important

of
rigidifying

An
arises
from
the
mono-anabelian
reconstruction
algorithms
of
§1,
i.e.,
one
regards
k
An
just
as
“some
ﬁeld
k

[isomorphic
to
k]”.
(O3)
Having
performed
the
operation
of
(O2),
one
can
now
proceed
to
apply
log-Frobenius
operation
log
[i.e.,
logk
]
to
k

.
This
operation
log
may
be
thought
of
as
the
assignment
×
(Π

k

)

(Π

{logk
(O×
)pf
}×
)
k
that
maps
the
group
of
nonzero
elements
of
the
topological
ﬁeld
k

to
the
group
of
nonzero
elements
of
the
topological
ﬁeld
“logk
(O×
)pf
”
[cf.
the
k
discussion
of
§I3].
(O4)
One
forgets
all
the
data
except
for
the
proﬁnite
group
Π.
(O5)
This
is
the
same
operation
as
the
operation
described
in
(O1).
With
regard
to
the
operation
log,
observe
that
if
we
forget
the
various
ﬁeld
or
group
structures
involved,
then
the
arrows
×
k
←
O×
k
→
logk
(O×
)pf
k
←
{logk
(O×
)pf

allow
one
to
relate
the
input
of
log
[on
the
left]
to
the
the
output
of
log
[on
the
right].
That
is
to
say,
in
the
formalism
developed
in
§3,
these
arrows
may
be
regarded
as
deﬁning
an
observable
“Slog
”
associated
to
log
[cf.
Corollary
3.6,
(iii)].
16
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
If
one
allows
oneself
to
reiterate
the
operation
log,
then
one
obtains
diagrams
equipped
with
a
natural
Z-action
[cf.
Corollary
3.6,
(v)].
These
diagrams
equipped
with
a
Z-action
are
reminiscent,
at
a
combinatorial
level,
of
the
“arithmetic
Gm
’s”
that
occurred
in
the
discussion
of
§I3
[cf.
Remark
3.6.3].
Next,
observe
that
the
operation
of
“projecting
to
Π”
[i.e.,
forgetting
all
of
the
data
under
consideration
except
for
Π]
is
compatible
with
the
execution
of
any
of
these
operations
(O1),
(O2),
(O3),
(O4),
(O5).
That
is
to
say,
Π
determines
a
core
of
this
collection
of
operations
[cf.
Corollary
3.6,
(i),
(ii),
(iii)].
Moreover,
since
the
mono-anabelian
reconstruction
algorithms
of
§1
are
“purely
group-theoretic”
and
depend
only
on
the
input
data
constituted
by
Π,
it
follows
immediately
that
[by
×
“projecting
to
Π”
and
then
applying
these
algorithms]
“(Π

k
An
)”
also
forms
a
core
of
this
collection
of
operations
[cf.
Corollary
3.6,
(i),
(ii),
(iii)].
In
particular,
×
we
obtain
a
natural
isomorphism
between
the
“(Π

k
An
)’s”
that
occur
following
the
ﬁrst
and
fourth
“’s”
of
the
above
diagram.
On
the
other
hand,
the
“forgetting”
operation
of
(O2)
may
be
thought
of
as
a
×
sort
of
section
of
the
“projection
to
the
core
(Π

k
An
)”.
This
sort
of
section
will
be
referred
to
as
a
telecore;
a
telecore
frequently
comes
equipped
with
an
auxiliary
structure,
called
a
contact
structure,
which
corresponds
in
the
present
situation
to
the
isomorphism
of
underlying
ﬁelds
[stripped
of
their
respective
zero
elements]
×
∼
×
×
k
An
→
k

[cf.
Corollary
3.6,
(ii)].
Even
though
the
core
“(Π

k
An
)”,
regarded
as
an
object
obtained
by
projecting,
is
constant
[up
to
isomorphism],
the
section
obtained
in
this
way
does
not
yield
a
“constant”
collection
of
data
[with
respect
to
the
operations
of
the
diagram
above]
that
is
compatible
with
the
observable
Slog
.
×
Indeed,
forgetting
the
marker
“An”
of
[the
constant]
k
An
and
then
applying
log
is
not
compatible,
relative
to
Slog
,
with
forgetting
the
marker
“An”
—
i.e.,
since
log
obliterates
the
ring
structures
involved
[cf.
Corollary
3.6,
(iv);
Remark
3.6.1].
Nevertheless,
if,
subsequent
to
applying
the
operations
of
(O2),
(O3),
one
×
projects
back
down
to
“(Π

k
An
)”,
then,
as
was
observed
above,
one
obtains
a
×
natural
isomorphism
between
the
initial
and
ﬁnal
copies
of
“(Π

k
An
)”.
It
is
in
this
sense
that
one
may
think
of
a
telecore
as
a
“core
with
a
time
lag”.
One
way
to
summarize
the
above
discussion
is
as
follows:
The
“purely
grouptheoretic”
mono-anabelian
reconstruction
algorithms
of
§1
allow
one
to
construct
×
models
of
scheme-theoretic
data
[i.e.,
the
“k
An
”]
that
satisfy
the
following
three
properties
[cf.
Remark
3.7.3,
(i),
(ii)]:
×
(P1)
coricity
[i.e.,
the
“property
of
being
a
core”
of
“Π”,
“(Π

k
An
)”];
(P2)
comparability
[i.e.,
via
the
telecore
and
contact
structures
discussed
×
above]
with
log-subject
copies
[i.e.,
the
“k

”,
which
are
subject
to
the
action
of
log];
(P3)
log-observability
[i.e.,
via
“Slog
”].
One
way
to
understand
better
what
is
gained
by
this
mono-anabelian
approach
is
to
consider
what
happens
if
one
takes
a
bi-anabelian
approach
to
this
situation
[cf.
Remarks
3.7.3,
(iii),
(iv);
3.7.5].
TOPICS
IN
ABSOLUTE
ANABELIAN
GEOMETRY

17
In
the
bi-anabelian
approach,
instead
of
taking
just
“Π”
as
one’s
core,
one
takes
the
data
×
(Π

k
model
)
—
where
“k
model
”
is
some
ﬁxed
reference
model
of
k
—
as
one’s
core
[cf.
Corollary
3.7,
(i)].
The
bi-anabelian
version
[i.e.,
fully
faithfulness
in
the
style
of
the
“Grothendieck
Conjecture”]
of
the
mono-anabelian
theory
of
§1
then
gives
rise
×
×
∼
to
telecore
and
contact
structures
by
considering
the
isomorphism
k
model
→
k

×
×
arising
from
an
isomorphism
between
the
“Π’s”
that
act
on
k
model
,
k

[cf.
Corollary
3.7,
(ii)].
Moreover,
one
may
deﬁne
an
observable
“Slog
”
as
in
the
mono-anabelian
case
[cf.
Corollary
3.7,
(iii)].
Just
as
in
the
mono-anabelian
case,
since
log
obliterates
×
the
ring
structures
involved,
this
model
k
model
fails
to
be
simultaneously
compatible
with
the
observable
Slog
and
the
telecore
and
[a
slight
extension,
as
described
in
Corollary
3.7,
(ii),
of
the]
contact
structures
just
mentioned
[cf.
Corollary
3.7,
(iv)].
On
the
other
hand,
whereas
in
the
mono-anabelian
case,
one
may
recover
from
this
failure
of
compatibility
by
projecting
back
down
to
“Π”
[which
remains
×
×
intact!]
and
hence
to
“(Π

k
An
)”,
in
the
bi-anabelian
case,
the
“k
model
”
portion
×
of
“the
core
(Π

k
model
)”
—
which
is
an
essential
portion
of
the
input
data
for
reconstruction
algorithms
via
the
bi-anabelian
approach!
[cf.
Remarks
3.7.3,
(iv);
3.7.5,
(ii)]
—
is
obliterated
by
log,
thus
rendering
it
impossible
to
relate
the
×
“(Π

k
model
)’s”
before
and
after
the
application
of
log
via
an
isomorphism
that
is
compatible
with
all
of
the
operations
involved.
At
a
more
technical
level,
the
nonexistence
of
such
a
natural
isomorphism
may
be
seen
in
the
fact
that
the
coricity
of
×
“(Π

k
model
)”
is
only
asserted
in
Corollary
3.7,
(i),
for
a
certain
limited
portion
of
the
diagram
involving
“all
of
the
operations
under
consideration”
[cf.
also
the
incompatibilities
of
Corollary
3.7,
(iv)].
This
contrasts
with
the
[manifest!]
coricity
×
of
“Π”,
“(Π

k
An
)”
with
respect
to
all
of
the
operations
under
consideration
in
the
mono-anabelian
case
[cf.
Corollary
3.6,
(i),
(ii),
(iii)].
In
this
context,
one
important
observation
is
that
if
one
tries
to
“subsume”
the
×
model
“k
model
”
into
Π
by
“regarding”
this
model
as
an
object
that
“arises
from
the
sole
input
data
Π”,
then
one
must
contend
with
various
problems
from
the
point
of
view
of
functoriality
—
cf.
Remark
3.7.4
for
more
details
on
such
“functorially
×
trivial
models”.
That
is
to
say,
to
regard
“k
model
”
in
this
way
means
that
one
must
contend
with
a
situation
in
which
the
functorially
induced
action
of
Π
on
×
“k
model
”
is
trivial!
Finally,
we
note
in
passing
that
the
“dynamics”
of
the
various
diagrams
of
operations
[i.e.,
functors]
appearing
in
the
above
discussion
are
reminiscent
of
the
analogy
with
physics
discussed
at
the
beginning
of
the
present
§I4
—
i.e.,
that
“Π”
×
is
massless,
like
light,
while
“k

”
is
of
positive
mass.
§I5.
Analogy
with
p-adic
Teichmüller
Theory
We
have
already
discussed
in
§I1
the
analogy
between
the
log-Frobenius
operation
log
and
the
Frobenius
morphism
in
positive
characteristic.
This
analogy
may
be
developed
further
[cf.
Remarks
3.6.6,
3.7.2
for
more
details]
into
an
analogy
between
the
formalism
discussed
in
§I4
and
the
notion
of
a
uniformizing
MF
∇
-object
18
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
as
discussed
in
[Mzk1],
[Mzk4],
i.e.,
an
MF
∇
-object
in
the
sense
of
[Falt]
that
gives
rise
to
“canonical
coordinates”
that
may
be
regarded
as
a
sort
of
p-adic
uniformization
of
the
variety
under
consideration.
Indeed,
in
the
notation
of
§I4,
the
×
“mono-anabelian
output
data
(Π

k
An
)”
may
be
regarded
as
corresponding
to
the
“Galois
representation”
associated
to
a
structure
of
“uniformizing
MF
∇
×
object”
on
the
scheme-theoretic
“(Π

k

)”.
The
telecore
structures
discussed
in
§I4
may
be
regarded
as
corresponding
to
a
sort
of
Hodge
ﬁltration,
i.e.,
an
operation
relating
the
“Frobenius
crystal”
under
consideration
to
a
speciﬁc
scheme
theory
×
“(Π

k

)”,
among
the
various
scheme
theories
separated
from
one
another
by
[the
non-ring-homomorphism!]
log.
The
associated
contact
structures
then
take
on
an
appearance
that
is
formally
reminiscent
of
the
notion
of
a
connection
in
the
classical
crystalline
theory.
The
failure
of
the
log-observable,
telecore,
and
contact
structures
to
be
simultaneously
compatible
[cf.
Corollaries
3.6,
(iv);
3.7,
(iv)]
may
then
be
regarded
as
corresponding
to
the
fact
that,
for
instance
in
the
case
of
the
uniformizing
MF
∇
-objects
determined
by
indigenous
bundles
in
[Mzk1],
[Mzk4],
the
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
is
an
isomorphism
[i.e.,
the
fact
that
the
Hodge
ﬁltration
fails
to
be
a
horizontal
Frobenius-invariant!].

In
the
context
of
this
analogy,
we
observe
that
the
failure
of
the
logarithms
at
the
various
localizations
of
a
number
ﬁeld
to
extend
to
a
global
map
involving
the
number
ﬁeld
[cf.
Remark
5.4.1]
may
be
regarded
as
corresponding
to
the
failure
of
various
Frobenius
liftings
on
aﬃne
opens
[i.e.,
localizations]
of
a
hyperbolic
curve
[over,
say,
a
ring
of
Witt
vectors
of
a
perfect
ﬁeld]
to
extend
to
a
morphism
deﬁned
[“globally”]
on
the
entire
curve
[cf.
[Mzk21],
Remark
2.6.2].
This
lack
of
a
global
extension
in
the
p-adic
case
means,
in
particular,
that
it
does
not
make
sense
to
pull-back
arbitrary
coherent
sheaves
on
the
curve
via
such
Frobenius
liftings.
On
the
other
hand,
if
a
coherent
sheaf
on
the
curve
is
equipped
with
the
structure
of
a
crystal,
then
a
“global
pull-back
of
the
crystal”
is
well-deﬁned
and
“canonical”,
even
though
the
various
local
Frobenius
liftings
used
to
construct
it
are
not.
In
a
similar
way,
although
the
logarithms
at
localizations
of
a
number
ﬁeld
are
not
compatible
with
the
ring
structures
involved,
hence
cannot
be
used
to
pull-back
arbitrary
ring/scheme-theoretic
objects,
they
can
be
used
to
“pull-back”
Galois-theoretic
structures,
such
as
those
obtained
by
applying
mono-anabelian
reconstruction
algorithms.

Moreover,
this
analogy
may
be

even
further
by
specializing
from
arbitrary
uniformizing
MF
∇
-objects
to
the
indigenous
bundles
of
the
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
of
[Mzk1],
[Mzk4].
To
see
this,
we
begin
by
observing
that
the
non-rigid
dimension
of
the
localizations
of
a
number
ﬁeld
“Gk
”,
“k
×
”
in
the
discussion
of
§I3
may
be
regarded
as
analogous
to
the
non-rigidity
of
a
p-adic
deformation
of
an
aﬃne
open
[i.e.,
a
localization]
of
a
hyperbolic
curve
in
positive
characteristic.
If,
on
the
other
hand,
such
a
hyperbolic
curve
is
equipped
with
the
crystal
determined
by
a
p-adic
indigenous
bundle,
then,
even
if
one
restricts
to
an
aﬃne
open,
this
ﬁltered
crystal
has
the
eﬀect
of
rigidifying
a
speciﬁc
p-adic
deformation
of
this
aﬃne
open.
Indeed,
this
rigidifying
eﬀect
is
an
immediate
consequence
of
the
fact
that
the
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
of
an
indigenous
bundle
is
an
isomorphism.
Put
another
way,
this
Kodaira-Spencer
isomorphism
has
the
eﬀect
of
allowing
the
aﬃne
open
to
“entrust
its
moduli”
to
the
crystal
determined
by
the
p-adic
indigenous
bundle.
This
situation
is
reminiscent
of
the
rigidifying
actions
discussed
in
§I3
of
“Gk
”,
“k
×
”
on
certain
geometric
data
arising
from
a
hyperbolic
orbicurve
that
is
related
to
a
once-punctured
elliptic
curve.
That
is
to
say,
the
mono-anabelian
theory
of
§1,
§2
allows
these
localizations
“Gk
”,
“k
×
”
of
a
number
ﬁeld
to
“entrust
their
ring
structures”
—
i.e.,
their
“arithmetic
holomorphic
moduli”
—
to
the
hyperbolic
orbicurve
under
consideration.
This
leads
naturally
[cf.
Remark
5.10.3,

to
the

If,
moreover,
one
modiﬁes
the
canonical

furnished
by

by
means
of
the
“Gaussian
zeroes”
[i.e.,
the
inverse
of
the
“Gaussian

that
appear
in
the
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
of
elliptic
curves
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk6],
§1.1],
then
one
may
further
reﬁne
the
above
analogy
by
regarding
indigenous
bundles
as
corresponding
to
the
crystalline
theta
object
[which
may
be
thought
of
as
20

an

by

with
the

of

[cf.

5.10.3,

From
this
point
of
view,
the
mono-anabelian
theory
of
§1,
§2,
which
may
be
thought
of
as
centering
around
the
technique
of
Belyi
cuspidalizations,
may
be
regarded
as
corresponding
to
the
theory
of
indigenous
bundles
in
positive
characteristic
[cf.
[Mzk1],
Chapter
II],
which
centers
around
the
Verschiebung
on
indigenous
bundles.
Moreover,
the
theory
of
the
étale
theta
function
given
in
[Mzk18],
which
centers
around
the
technique
of
elliptic
cuspidalizations,
may
be
regarded
as
corresponding
to
the
theory
of
the
Frobenius
action
on
square
diﬀerentials
in
[Mzk1],
Chapter
II.
Indeed,
just
as
the
technique
of
elliptic
cuspidalizations
may
be
thought
of
a
sort
of
linearized,
simpliﬁed
version
of
the
technique
of
Belyi
cuspidalizations,
the
Frobenius
action
on
square
diﬀerentials
occurs
as
the
derivative
[i.e.,
a
“linearized,
simpliﬁed
version”]
of
the
Verschiebung
on
indigenous
bundles.
For
more
on
this
analogy,
we
refer
to
Remark
5.10.3.
In
passing,
we
observe,
relative
to
the
point
of
view
that
the
theory
of
the
étale
theta
function
given
in
[Mzk18]
somehow
represents
a
“linearized,
simpliﬁed
version”
of
the
mono-anabelian
theory
of
the
present
paper,
that
the
issue
of
mono-
versus
bianabelian
geometry
discussed
in
the
present
paper
is
vaguely
reminiscent
of
the
issue
of
mono-
versus
bi-theta
environments,
which
constitutes
a
central
theme
in
[Mzk18].
In
this
context,
it
is
perhaps
natural
to
regard
the
“log-wall”
discussed
in
§I4
—
which
forms
the
principal
obstruction
to
applying
the
bi-anabelian
approach
in
the
present
paper
—
as
corresponding
to
the
“Θ-wall”
constituted
by
the
theta
function
between
the
theta
and
algebraic
trivializations
of
a
certain
ample
line
bundle
—
which
forms
the
principal
obstruction
to
the
use
of
bi-theta
environments
in
the
theory
of
[Mzk18].

Thus,
in
summary,
the
analogy
discussed
above
may
be
regarded
as
an
analogy
between
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
and
the
positive
characteristic
portion
of
the
theory
of
[Mzk1].
This
“positive
characteristic
portion”
may
be
regarded
as
including,
in
a
certain
sense,
the
“liftings
modulo
p2
portion”
of
the
theory
of
[Mzk1]
since
this
“liftings
modulo
p2
portion”
may
be
formulated,
to
a
certain
extent,
in
terms
of
positive
characteristic
scheme
theory.
If,
moreover,
one
regards
the
theory
of
mono-anabelian
log-Frobenius
compatibility
as
corresponding
to
“Frobenius
liftings
modulo
p2
”,
then
the
isomorphism
between
Galois
groups
on
both
sides
of
the
log-wall
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
the
Frobenius

action
on

induced
by
dividing
the
derivative
of
such
a
Frobenius

modulo

by
p.
This
correspondence
between
Galois
groups
and
diﬀerentials
is
reminiscent
of
the
discussion
in
[Mzk6],
§1.3,
§1.4,
of
the
arithmetic
KodairaSpencer
morphism
that
arises
from
the
[scheme-theoretic]
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
of
elliptic
curves.
Finally,
from
this
point
of
view,
it
is
perhaps
natural
to
regard
the
mono-anabelian
reconstruction

of
§1
as
corresponding
to
the
procedure
of
integrating
Frobenius-invariant
diﬀerentials
so
as
to

The

prompts
the

question:
Can
one
further
extend
the
theory
given
in
the
present
paper
to
a
theory
that
is
analogous
to
the
theory
of
canonical
p-adic
liftings
given
in
[Mzk1],
Chapter
III?
It
is
the
intention
of
the
author
to
pursue
the
goal
of
developing
such
an
“extended
theory”
in
a
future
paper.
Before
proceeding,
we
note
that
the
analogy
of
such
a
theory
with
the
theory
of
canonical
p-adic
liftings
of
[Mzk1],
Chapter
III,
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
p-adic

of

of

while
the

corresponds
to
“rotations”
[i.e.,
the
theory
of
“monoanabelian

of

given
in
the
present
paper].
This
point
of
view
is
reminiscent
of
the
analogy
between
the
archimedean
and
nonarchimedean
theories
discussed
in
Table
1
of
the
Introduction
to
[Mzk14].
In
this
context,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
this
analogy
between
the
monoanabelian
theory
of
the
present
paper
and
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
is
reminiscent
of
various
phenomena
that
appear
in
earlier
papers
by
the
author:
22
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
(A1)
In
[Mzk10],
Theorem
3.6,
an
absolute
p-adic
anabelian
result
is
obtained
for
canonical
curves
as
in
[Mzk1]
by
applying
the
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
of
[Mzk1].
Thus,
in
a
certain
sense
[i.e.,
“Teichmüller
=⇒
anabelian”
as
opposed
to
“anabelian
=⇒
Teichmüller”],
this
result
goes
in
the
opposite
direction
to
the
direction
of
the
theory
of
the
present
paper.
On
the
other
hand,
this
result
of
[Mzk10]
depends
on
the
analysis
in
[Mzk9],
§2,
of
the
logarithmic
special
ﬁber
of
a
p-adic
hyperbolic
curve
via
absolute
anabelian
geometry
over
ﬁnite
ﬁelds.

reconstruction
of
the
“additive

via
the
mono-anabelian
algorithms
of
§1
[cf.
the
lemma
of
Uchida
reviewed
in
Proposition
1.3],
which
eventually
leads
[as
discussed
above],
via
the
theory
of
§3,
to
an
abstract
analogue
of
“Frobenius
liftings”
[i.e.,
in
the

[cf.
Remark
5.10.4]
of
the

of

in
[Mzk21],
Corollary
2.9,
via
an
argument
analogous
to
an

that

to

of

[cf.

to
think
about

(A2)
is
by
considering

between
the
upper
right-hand
and
lower
left-hand
non-italicized
entries
of
the
above
chart.
That
is
to
say,
the
theory
of
(A2)
[i.e.,
of
geometric
uniformly
toral
neighborhoods
—
cf.
[Mzk21],
§2]
is
related
to
the
upper
right-hand
non-italicized
entry
of
the
chart
in
that,
like
the
application
of
“Uchida’s
Lemma”
represented
by
this
entry,
it
provides
a
means
for
recovering
the
ring
structure
of
the
base
ﬁeld,
given
the
decomposition
groups
of
the
closed
points
of
the
hyperbolic
orbicurve.
On
the
other
hand,
the
theory
of
(A2)
[i.e.,
of
[Mzk21],
§2]
is
related
to
the
lower
left-hand
entry
of
the
chart
in
that
the
main
result
of
[Mzk21],
§2,
is
obtained
by
an
argument
reminiscent
[cf.
[Mzk21],
Remark
2.6.2;
[Mzk21],
Remark
2.9.1]
of
the
argument
to
the
eﬀect
that
stable
curves
over
rings
of
Witt
vectors
of
a
perfect
ﬁeld
never
admit
Frobenius
liftings.
Note,
moreover,
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
discussion
above
of
“arithmetic
holomorphic
structures”,
this
bridge
may
be
thought
of
as
a
link
between
the
elementary
algebraic
approach
to
reconstructing
the
“two
combinatorial
dimensions”
of
a
ring
in
the
fashion
of
Uchida’s
Lemma
and
the
“p-adic
diﬀerentialgeometric
approach”
to
reconstructing
p-adic
ring
structures
in
the
fashion
of
the
theory
of
[Mzk21],
§2.
Here,
we
observe
that
this
“p-adic
diﬀerential-geometric
approach”
makes
essential
use
of
the
hyperbolicity
of
the
curve
under
consideration.
Indeed,
roughly
speaking,
from
the
“Teichmüller-theoretic”
point
of
view
of
the
present
discussion,
the
argument
of
the
proof
of
[Mzk21],
Lemma
2.6,
(ii),
may
be
summarized
as
follows:
The
nonexistence
of
the
desired
“geometric
uniformly
toral
neighborhoods”
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
nonexistence
of
obstructions
to
Teichmüller
deformations
of
the
“arithmetic
holomorphic
structure”
that
extend
in
an
unbounded,
linear
fashion,
like
a
geodesic
ﬂow
or
Frobenius
lifting.
On
the
other
hand,
the
hyperbolicity
of
the
curve
under
consideration
implies
the
existence
of
topological
obstructions
—
i.e.,
in
the
form
of
“loopiﬁcation”
or
“crushed
components”
[cf.
[Mzk21],
Lemma
2.6,
(ii)]
—
to
such
“unbounded”
deformations
of
the
holomorphic
structure.
Moreover,
such
“compact
bounds”
on
the
deformability
of
the
holomorphic
structure
are
suﬃcient
to
“trap”
the
holomorphic
structure
at
a
“canonical
point”,
which
corresponds
to
the
original
holomorphic
[i.e.,
ring]
structure
of
interest.
Put
another
way,
this
“p-adic
diﬀerential-geometric
interpretation
of
hyperbolicity”
is
reminiscent
of
the
dynamics
of
a
rubber
band,
whose
elasticity
implies
that
even
if
one
tries
to
stretch
the
rubber
band
in
an
unbounded
fashion,
the
rubber
band
ultimately
returns
to
a
“canonical
position”.
Moreover,
this
relationship
between
hyperbolicity
and
“elasticity”
is
reminiscent
of
the
use
of
the
term
“elastic”
in
describing
certain
group-theoretic
aspects
of
hyperbolicity
in
the
theory
of
[Mzk20],
§1,
§2.
In
passing,
we
observe
that
another
important
aspect
of
the
theory
of
[Mzk21],
§2,
in
the
present
context
is
the
use
of
the
inequality
of
degrees
obtained
by
“diﬀerentiating
a
Frobenius
lifting”
[cf.
[Mzk21],
Remark
2.6.2].
The
key
importance
of
such
degree
inequalities
in
the
theory
of
[Mzk21],
§2,
suggests,
relative
to
the
above
chart,
that
the
analogue
of
such
degree
inequalities
in
the
theory
of
“the
analogue
of
Frobenius
liftings
in
a
future
extension
of
the
mono-anabelian
24
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
theory”
could
give
rise
to
results
of
substantial
interest
in
the
arithmetic
of
number
ﬁelds.
The
author
hopes
to
address
this
topic
in
more
detail
in
a
future
paper.
Finally,
we
close
the
present
Introduction
to
the
present
paper
with
some
historical
remarks.
We
begin
by
considering
the
following
historical
facts:
(H1)
O.
Teichmüller,
in
his
relatively
short
career
as
a
mathematician,
made
contributions
both
to
“complex
Teichmüller
theory”
and
to
the
theory
of
Teichmüller
representatives
of
Witt
rings
—
two
subjects
that,
at
ﬁrst
glance,
appear
entirely
unrelated
to
one
another.
(H2)
In
the
Introduction
to
[Ih],
Y.
Ihara
considers
the
issue
of
obtaining
canonical
p-adic
liftings
of
certain
positive
characteristic
hyperbolic
curves
equipped
with
a
correspondence
in
a
fashion
analogous
to
the
Serre-Tate
theory
of
canonical
liftings
of
abelian
varieties.
These
two
facts
may
be
regarded
as
interesting
precursors
of
the
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
of
[Mzk1],
[Mzk4].
Indeed,
the
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
of
[Mzk1],
[Mzk4]
may
be
regarded,
on
the
one
hand,
as
an
analogue
for
hyperbolic
curves
of
the
Serre-Tate
theory
of
canonical
liftings
of
abelian
varieties
and,
on
the
other
hand,
as
a
p-adic
analogue
of
complex
Teichmüller
theory;
moreover,
the
canonical
liftings
obtained
in
[Mzk1],
[Mzk4]
are,
literally,
“hyperbolic
curve
versions
of
Teichmüller
representatives
in
Witt
rings”.
In
fact,
one
may
even
go
one
step
further
to
speculate
that
perhaps
the
existence
of
analogous
complex
and
p-adic
versions
of
“Teichmüller
theory”
should
be
regarded
as
hinting
of
a
deeper
abstract,
combinatorial
version
of
“Teichmüller
theory”
—
in
a
fashion
that
is
perhaps
reminiscent
of
the
relationship
of
the
notion
of
a
motive
to
various
complex
or
p-adic
cohomology
theories.
It
is
the
hope
of
the
author
that
a
possible
“future
extended
theory”
as
discussed
above
—
i.e.,
a
sort
of
“Teichmüller
theory”
for
number
ﬁelds
equipped
with
a
once-punctured
elliptic
curve
—
might
prove
to
be
just
such
a
“Teichmüller
theory”.

An
oriented
graph
Γ
is
a
graph
Γ,
which
we
shall
refer
to
as
the
underlying
graph
of
Γ,
equipped
with
the
additional
data
of
a
total
ordering,
for
each
edge
e
of
Γ,
on
the
set
[of
cardinality
2]
of
branches
of
e
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk13],
the
discussion
at
the
beginning
of
§1,
for
a
deﬁnition
of
the
terms
“graph”,
“branch”].
In
this
situation,
we
shall
refer
to
the
vertices,
edges,
and
branches
of
Γ
as
vertices,
edges,
and
branches
of
Γ;
write
V(Γ),
E(Γ),
B(Γ),
respectively,
for
the
sets
of
vertices,
edges,
and
branches
of
Γ.
Also,
whenever
Γ
satisﬁes
a
property
of
graphs
[such
as
“ﬁniteness”],
we
shall
say
that
Γ
satisﬁes
this
property.
We
shall
refer
to
the
oriented
graph
Γopp
obtained
from
Γ
by
reversing
the
ordering
on
the
branches
of
each
edge
as
the
opposite
oriented
graph
to
Γ.
A
morphism
of
oriented
graphs
is
deﬁned
to
be
a
morphism
of
the
underlying
graphs
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk13],
§1,
the
discussion
at
the
beginning
of
§1]
that
is
compatible
with
the
orderings
on
the
26

edges.
Note
that
any
countably
ordered
set
E
may
be
regarded
as
an
oriented
graph
—
i.e.,
whose
vertices
are
the
elements
of
E,
whose
edges
are
the
pairs
of
adjacent
elements
of
E,
and
whose
branches
are
equipped
with
the
[total]
ordering
induced
by
the
ordering
of
E.
We
shall
refer
to
an
oriented
graph
that
arises
from
a
countably
ordered
set
as
linear.
We
shall
refer
to
the
vertex
of
a
linear
oriented
graph
Γ
determined
by
a
minimal
(respectively,
maximal)
element
of
the
corresponding
countably
ordered
set
as
the
minimal
vertex
(respectively,
maximal
vertex)
of
Γ.
Let
Γ
be
an
oriented
graph.
Then
we
shall
refer
to
as
a
pre-path
[of
length
n]
[where
n
≥
0
is
an
integer]
on
Γ
a
morphism
γ
:
Γγ
→
Γ,
where
Γγ
is
a
ﬁnite
linear
oriented
graph
with
precisely
n
edges;
we
shall
refer
to
as
a
path
[of
length
n]
on
Γ
any
isomorphism
class
[γ]
in
the
category
of
oriented
graphs
over
Γ
of
a
pre-path
γ
[of
length
n].
Write
Ω(Γ)
for
the
set
[i.e.,
since
we
are
working
with
isomorphism
classes!]
of
paths
on
Γ.
If
γ
:
Γγ
→
Γ
is
a
pre-path
on
Γ,
then
we
shall
refer
to
the
image
of
the
minimal
(respectively,
maximal)
vertex
of
Γγ
as
the
initial
(respectively,
terminal)
vertex
of
γ,
[γ].
Two
[pre-]paths
with
the
same
initial
(respectively,
terminal;
initial
and
terminal)
vertices
will
be
referred
to
as
co-initial
(respectively,
co-terminal;
coverticial).
If
γ1
,
γ2
are
pre-paths
on
Γ
such
the
initial
vertex
of
γ2
is
equal
to
the
terminal
vertex
of
γ1
,
then
one
may
form
the
composite
pre-path
γ2
◦
γ1
[in
the
def
evident
sense],
as
well
as
the
composite
path
[γ2
]
◦
[γ1
]
=
[γ2
◦
γ1
].
Thus,
the
length
of
γ2
◦
γ1
is
equal
to
the
sum
of
the
lengths
of
γ1
,
γ2
.
Next,
let
E
⊆
Ω(Γ)
×
Ω(Γ)
be
a
set
of
ordered
pairs
of
paths
on
an
oriented
graph
Γ.
Then
we
shall
say
that
E
is
saturated
if
the
following
conditions
are
satisﬁed:
(a)
(Partial
Inclusion
of
the
Diagonal)
If
([γ1
],
[γ2
])
∈
E,
then
E
contains
([γ1
],
[γ1
])
and
([γ2
],
[γ2
]).
(b)
(Co-verticiality)
If
([γ1
],
[γ2
])
∈
E,
then
[γ1
],
[γ2
]
are
co-verticial.
(c)
(Transitivity)
If
([γ1
],
[γ2
])
∈
E
and
([γ2
],
[γ3
])
∈
E,
then
([γ1
],
[γ3
])
∈
E.
(d)
(Pre-composition)
If
([γ1
],
[γ2
])
∈
E
and
[γ3
]
∈
Ω(Γ),
then
([γ1
]◦[γ3
],
[γ2
]◦
[γ3
])
∈
E,
whenever
these
composite
paths
are
deﬁned.
(e)
(Post-composition)
If
([γ1
],
[γ2
])
∈
E
and
[γ3
]
∈
Ω(Γ),
then
([γ3
]
◦
[γ1
],
[γ3
]
◦
[γ2
])
∈
E,
whenever
these
composite
paths
are
deﬁned.
We
shall
say
that
E
is
symmetrically
saturated
if
E
is
saturated
and,
moreover,
satisﬁes
the
following
condition:
(f)
(Reﬂexivity)
If
([γ1
],
[γ2
])
∈
E,
then
([γ2
],
[γ1
])
∈
E.
Thus,
the
set
of
all
co-verticial
pairs
of
paths
Covert(Γ)
⊆
Ω(Γ)
×
Ω(Γ)
TOPICS

is
symmetrically
saturated.
Moreover,
the
property
of
being
saturated
(respectively,
symmetrically
saturated)
is
closed
with
respect
to
forming
arbitrary
intersections
of
subsets
of
Ω(Γ)
×
Ω(Γ).
In
particular,
given
any
subset
E
⊆
Covert(Γ),
it
makes
sense
to
speak
of
the
saturation
(respectively,
symmetric
saturation)
of
E
—
i.e.,
the
smallest
saturated
(respectively,
symmetrically
saturated)
subset
of
Covert(Γ)
containing
E.
Let
Γ
be
an
oriented
graph.
Then
we
shall
refer
to
a
vertex
v
of
Γ
as
a
nexus
of
Γ
if
the
following
conditions
are
satisﬁed:
(a)
the
oriented
graph
Γv
obtained
by
removing
from
Γ
the
vertex
v,
together
with
all
of
the
edges
that
abut
to
v,
decomposes
as
a
disjoint
union
of
two
nonempty
oriented
graphs
Γ<v
,
Γ>v
;
(b)
every
edge
of
Γ
that
is
not
contained
in
Γv
either
runs
from
a
vertex
of
Γ<v
to
v
or
from
v
to
a
vertex
of
Γ>v
.
In
this
situation,
we
shall
refer
to
the
oriented
subgraph
Γ≤v
(respectively,
Γ≥v
)
consisting
of
v,
Γ<v
(respectively,
Γ>v
),
and
all
of
the
edges
of
Γ
that
run
to
(respectively,
emanate
from)
v
as
the
pre-nexus
portion
(respectively,
post-nexus
portion)
of
Γ.
Categories:
Let
C,
C

be
categories.
Then
we
shall
use
the
notation
Ob(C);
Arr(C)
to
denote,
respectively,
the
objects
and
arrows
of
C.
We
shall
refer
to
a
functor
φ

C

as
rigid
if
every
automorphism
of
φ
is
equal
to
the
identity
[cf.
[Mzk16],
§0].
If
the
identity
functor
of
C
is
rigid,
then
we
shall
say
that
C
is
id-rigid.
Let
C
be
a
category
and
Γ
an
oriented
graph.
Then
we
shall
refer
to
as
a
Γ-diagram
{Av

}
in
C
a
collection
of
data
as
follows:
(a)
for
each
v
∈
V(Γ),
an

Av
of
C;
(b)
for
each
e
∈
E(Γ)
that
runs
from
v1
∈
V(Γ)
to
v2
∈

a

φe

of

A
morphism
{Av

of

is
deﬁned
to
be
a

of

:
Av

for
each
vertex
v
of
Γ
that
are
compatible
with
the
φe

φe
.
We
shall
refer
to
an
Γ-diagram
in
C
as
commutative
if
the
composite
morphisms
determined
by
any
co-verticial
pair
of
paths
on
Γ
coincide.
Write
C[Γ]
for
the

If

then
we
deﬁne
the

C1

C2
of

C2

where

for

such
that
β

=

One
veriﬁes
easily
that
if
Φ2
is
an
equivalence,
then
the
natural
projection
functor
C1

C2

C1
is
also
an
equivalence.
We
shall
use
the
preﬁx
“ind-”
(respectively,
“pro-”)
to
mean,
strictly
speaking,
a(n)
inductive
(respectively,
projective)
system
indexed
by
an
ordered
set
isomorphic
to
the
positive
(respectively,
negative)
integers,
with
their
usual
ordering.
To
simplify
notation,
however,
we
shall
often
denote
“ind-objects”
via
the
corresponding
“limit
objects”,
when
there
is
no
fear
of
confusion.
Let
C
be
a
category.
Then
we
shall
refer
to
a
pair
(S,
A),
where
S
∈
Ob(C),
and
A
⊆
AutC
(S)
is
a
subgroup,
as
a
pre-orbi-object
of
C.
[Thus,
we
think
of
the
pair
(S,
A)
as
representing
the
“stack-theoretic
quotient
of
S
by
A”.]
A
morphism
of
pre-orbi-objects
(S1
,
A1
)
→
(S2
,
A2
)
is
an
A2
-orbit
of
morphisms
S1

[relative
to
the
action
of
A2
on
the
codomain]
that
is
closed
under
the
action
of
A1
[on
the
domain].
We
shall
refer
to
as
an
orbi-object
{(Sι

αι,ι

∈I
any
collection
of

consisting
of

for

A
morphism
of
orbi-objects
is
deﬁned
to
be
a
collection
of
morphisms
of
pre-orbi-objects
from
each
representative
of
the
domain
to
each
representative
of
the
codomain
which
are
compatible
with
the
gluing
isomorphisms.
The
category
of
orbi-objects
associated
to
C
is
the
category
—
which
we
shall
denote
Orb(C)
—
whose
objects
are
the
orbi-objects
of
C,
and
whose
morphisms
are
the
morphisms
of
orbi-objects.
Thus,
an
object
may
be
regarded
as
a
pre-orbi-object
whose
group
of
automorphisms
is
trivial;
a
pre-orbi-object
may
be
regarded
as
an
orbi-object
with
precisely
one
representative.
In
particular,
we
obtain
a
natural

C

Orb(C)
which
is
“functorial”
[in
the
evident

with
respect
to
C.

Section

Galois-theoretic
Reconstruction
Algorithms
In
the
present
§1,
we
apply
the
technique
of
Belyi
cuspidalization
developed
in
[Mzk21],
§3,
to
give
a
group-theoretic
reconstruction
algorithm
[cf.
Theorem
1.9,
Corollary

for
hyperbolic
orbicurves
of
strictly
Belyi

over
sub-p-adic
ﬁelds
that
is
compatible
with
base-change
of
the
base
ﬁeld.
In
the
case
of
function
ﬁelds,
this
reconstruction
algorithm
reduces
to
a
much
more
elementary
algorithm
[cf.
Theorem
1.11],
which
is
valid
over
somewhat
more
general
base
ﬁelds,
namely
base
ﬁelds
which
are
“Kummer-faithful”
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.5].
Let
X
be
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
a
ﬁeld
k.
Write
KX
for
the
function
ﬁeld
of
X.
Then
the
content
of
following
result
is
a
consequence
of
the
well-known
theory
of
divisors
on
algebraic
curves.
Proposition
1.1.
(Review
of
Linear
Systems)
Suppose
that
X
is
proper,
and
that
k
is
algebraically
closed.
Write
Div(f
)
for
the
divisor
[of
zeroes
minus
poles
on
X]
of
f
∈
KX
.
If
E
is
a
divisor
on
X,
then
let
us
write
Γ×
(E)
=
{f

|
Div(f

+
E
≥

def
[where
we
use
the
notation
“(−)
≥
0”
to
denote
the
eﬀectivity
of
the
divisor
“(−)”],
def
l(E)
=
dimk
(Γ(X,
OX
(E))).
Let
D
be
a
divisor
on
X.
Then:
(i)
Γ×
(D)
admits
a
natural
free
action
by
k
×
whenever
it
is
nonempty;
there
∼
is
a
natural
bijection
Γ×
(D)
→
Γ(X,

that
is
compatible
with
the
k
×
actions
on
either
side,
whenever
the
sets
of
the
bijection
are
nonempty.
(ii)
The
integer
l(D)
≥
0
is
equal
to
the
smallest
nonnegative
integer
d
such
that
there
exists
an
eﬀective
divisor
E
of
degree
d
on
X
for
which
Γ×
(D
−
E)
=
∅.
In
particular,
l(D)
=
0
if
and
only
if
Γ×
(D)
=
∅.
Proposition
1.2.
(Additive

Let
X,
k
be

in

1.1.
Then:
(i)
There
exist
distinct

x,
y1

y2

together
with
a

D
on

such
that
x,
y1

y2
∈

[where
we
write

such
that
l(D)
=

l(D

(ii)
Let

Then
for

there

(iii)
Let

Then

such
that
g(y1

=

g(y2

In
particular,
in
this
situation,
the
element
λ

may
be
characterized
as
the
element
g(x)

.
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
Let
D
be
any
divisor
on
X
such
that
l(D)
≥
2.
By
subtracting
an
appropriate
eﬀective
divisor
from
D,
we
may
assume
that
l(D)
=
2.
Then
take
x
∈
X(k)\Supp(D)
to
be
any
point
such
that
OX
(D)
admits
a
global
section
that
does
not
vanish
at
x
[so
l(D
−
x)
=
1];
take
y1
∈
X(k)\(Supp(D)
{x})
to
be
any
point
such
that
OX
(D−x)
admits
a
global
section
that
does
not
vanish
at
y1
[so
l(D
−
x
−
y1
)
=
0,
which
implies
that
l(D
−
y1
)
=
1];
take
y2
∈
X(k)\(Supp(D)
{x,
y1
})
to
be
any
point
such
that
OX
(D
−
x),
OX
(D
−
y1
)
admit
global
sections
that
do
not
vanish
at
y2
[so
l(D
−
x
−
y2
)
=
l(D
−
y1
−
y2
)
=
0].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Now
assertions
(ii),
(iii)
follow
immediately
from
assertion
(i).
The
following
reconstruction
of
the
additive
structure
from
divisors
and
rational
functions
is
implicit
in
the
argument
of
[Uchi],

[cf.

[Tama],

4.7].
Proposition
1.3.
(Additive

Let

1.1.
Then
there

[i.e.,
arising
from

for
constructing
the

on

of

]
from
the
following
data:

VX
=
{ordx

def
∼
[so
we
have
a
natural
bijection
VX
→
X(k)]
that
arise
as
valuation
maps
associated
to
points
x
∈
X(k);
×
(c)
for
each

v
=
ordx

VX
,
the
subgroup
Uv
⊆
KX
given
×
by
the
f

KX
such
that
f

Here,
the
term
“functorial”
is
with
respect
to
isomorphisms
[in
the
evident
sense]
of
such
triples
[i.e.,
consisting
of
a
group,
a
set
of
homomorphisms
from
the
group
to
Z,
and
a
collection
of
subgroups
of
the
group
parametrized
by
elements
of
this
set
of
homomorphisms]
arising
from
proper
hyperbolic
curves
[i.e.,
“X”]
over
algebraically
closed
ﬁelds
[i.e.,
“k”].
×
may
be
constructed
as
the
interProof.
Indeed,
ﬁrst
we
observe
that
k
×
⊆
KX
section
v∈VX
Ker(v).
Since,
for
v
∈
VX
,
we
have
a
direct
product
decomposition
Ker(v)
=
Uv
×
k
×
,
the
projection
to
k
×
allows
us
to
“evaluate”
elements
of
Ker(v)
[i.e.,
“functions
that
are
invertible
at
the
point
associated
to
v”],
so
as
to
obtain
“values”
of
such
elements
∈
k
×
.
Next,
let
us
observe
that

set
of

allows
one
to
speak
of
divisors
and
eﬀective

associated
to
[the

If
D
is
a

associated
to
KX
,
then
we
may
deﬁne

as
in
Proposition
1.1,
and
hence
compute
the
integer
l(D)
as
in
Proposition
1.1,

In
particular,
it
makes
sense
to
speak
of
data
as
in
Proposition
1.2,
(i),
associated
to
the
abstract
data
(a),
(b),
(c).
Thus,
by
evaluating
elements
of
various
Ker(v),
for
v
∈
VX
,
we
may
apply
the
characterizations
of
Proposition
1.2,
(ii),
(iii),
to
construct
the
additive
structure
of
k
×
,
hence
also
the
additive
structure
of
×
KX
[i.e.,
by
“evaluating”
at
various
v
∈
VX
].
Remark
1.3.1.
Note
that
if
G
is
an
abstract
group,
then
the
datum
of
a
surjection

may
be
thought
of
as
the

Suppose
that

that

If
U

Then:

x

Ux

Then
the
inertia
group
Ix
of
x

is
naturally
isomorphic

to

the

Let

[cf.
the

Proof.
Assertion
(i)
is
well-known

Assertion

Let

The

Remark
1.5.1.
In
the
notation
of
Deﬁnition
1.5,
suppose
that
k
is
a
torally
Kummer-faithful
ﬁeld,
l
a
prime
number.
Then
it
follows
immediately
from
the
injectivity
of
the
Kummer
map
associated
to
Gm
over
any
ﬁnite
extension
of
k
that
contains
a
primitive
l-th

l
has
open
image
[cf.
the
notion
of
“l-cyclotomic
fullness”
discussed
in
[Mzk20],
Lemma
4.5].
In
particular,
it
makes
sense
to
speak
of
the
“power-equivalence

[cf.

Remark
1.5.2.
By
considering
the
Weil
restrictions
of
semi-abelian
varieties

one
veriﬁes

(i)
Let
k
be
a(n)
[not
necessarily
ﬁnite!]
algebraic
ﬁeld
extension
of
a
number
ﬁeld
such
that
there
exists
a
nonarchimedean
prime
of
k
that
is
unramiﬁed
over
some
number
ﬁeld
contained
in
k,
and,
moreover,
for
every
ﬁnite
extension
k
†
of
k,
μ(k
†
)
is
ﬁnite.
Then
I
claim
that:
k
is
torally
Kummer-faithful.
Indeed,
since
[as
one
veriﬁes
immediately]
any
ﬁnite
extension
of
k
satisﬁes
the
same
hypotheses
as
k,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
N
(k
×
)N
=
{1}
[where
N
ranges
over
the
positive
integers].
Let
f
∈
N
(k
×
)N
.
If
f
∈
μ(k),
then
the
assumption
concerning
μ(k)
implies
immediately
that
f
=
1;
thus,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
f
∈
μ(k).
But
then
there
exists
a
nonarchimedean
prime
p
of
k
that
is
unramiﬁed
over
some
number
ﬁeld
contained
in
k.
In
particular,
if
we
write
kp
for
the
completion
of
k
at
p
and
p
for
the
residue
characteristic
of
p,
then
kp
embeds
into
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
the
quotient
ﬁeld
of
the
ring
of
Witt
vectors
of
an
algebraic
closure
of
Fp
.
Thus,
the
fact
that
f
admits
arbitrary
p-power
roots
in
kp
yields
a
contradiction.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
claim.
(ii)
It
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
“Kummer-faithful
=⇒
torally
Kummer-faithful”.
On
the
other
hand,
as
was
pointed
out
to
the
author
by
A.
Tamagawa,
one
may
construct
an
example
of
a
ﬁeld
which
is
torally
Kummerfaithful,
but
not
Kummer-faithful,
as
follows:
Let
E
be√an
elliptic
curve
over
a
number
ﬁeld
k0
that
admits
complex
multiplication
by
Q(
−1)
and,
moreover,
has
good
reduction
at
every
nonarchimedean
prime
of
k0
.
Let
k
be
an
algebraic
closure
def
of
k0
,
Gk0
=
Gal(k/k0
),
p
a
prime
number
≡
1
(mod
4).
Write
V
for
the
p-adic
Tate
module
associated
to
E.
Thus,
the
Gk0
-module
V
decomposes
[since
p
≡
1
(mod
4)]
into
a
direct
sum
W
⊕
W

of
submodules
W,
W

⊆
V
of
rank
one.
Write
χ
:
Gk0
→
Z×
p
for
the
character
determined
by
W
.
Thus,
[as
is
well-known]
χ
is
unramiﬁed
over
every
nonarchimedean
prime
of
k0
of
residue
characteristic
l
=
p,
as
well
as
over
some
nonarchimedean
prime
of
k0
of
residue
characteristic
p.
But
one
veriﬁes
immediately
[for
instance,
by
considering
ramiﬁcation
over
Q]
that
this
implies
that,
if
we
write
k
for
the
extension
ﬁeld
of
k0
determined
by
the
kernel
of
χ,
then
μ(k)
is
ﬁnite.
Thus,
since
any
ﬁnite
extension
of
k0
satisﬁes
the
same
hypotheses
as
k0
,
we
conclude
that
k
satisﬁes
the
hypotheses
of
(i),
so
k
is
torally
Kummer-faithful.
On
the
other
hand,
[by
the
deﬁnition
of
χ,
W
,
V
!]
the
Kummer
map
on
E(k)
is
not
injective,
so
k
is
not
Kummer-faithful.
Remark
1.5.4.
(i)
Observe
that
every
sub-p-adic
ﬁeld
k
[cf.
[Mzk5],
Deﬁnition
15.4,
(i)]
is
Kummer-faithful,
i.e.,
“sub-p-adic
=⇒
Kummer-faithful”.
Indeed,
to
verify
this,
one
reduces
immediately,
by
base-change,
to
the
case
where
k
is
a
ﬁnitely
generated
extension
of
an
MLF,
which
may
be
thought
of
as
the
function
ﬁeld
of
a
variety
over
an
MLF.
Then
by
restricting
to
various
closed
points
of
this
variety,
one
reduces
to
the
case
where
k
itself
is
an
MLF.
On
the
other
hand,
if
k,
hence
also
kH
[cf.
the
notation
of
Deﬁnition
1.5],
is
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
,
then
A(kH
)
is
an
extension
of
a
ﬁnitely
generated
Z-module
by
a
compact
abelian
p-adic
Lie
group,
hence
contains
an
open
subgroup
that
is
isomorphic
to
a
ﬁnite
product
of
copies
of
Zp
.
In
particular,
the
condition
of
Deﬁnition
1.5,
(a),
is
satisﬁed.
34
SHINICHI

(ii)
A
similar
argument
to
the
argument
of
(i)
shows
that
every
ﬁnitely
generated
extension
of
a
Kummer-faithful
ﬁeld
(respectively,
torally
Kummer-faithful
ﬁeld)
is
itself
Kummer-faithful
(respectively,
torally
Kummer-faithful
ﬁeld).
(iii)
On
the
other
hand,
observe
that
if,
for
instance,
I
is
an
inﬁnite
set,
then
the
def
ﬁeld
k
=
Qp
(xi
)i∈I
[which
is
not
a
ﬁnitely
generated
extension
of
Qp
]
constitutes
an
example
of
a
Kummer-faithful
ﬁeld
which
is
not
sub-p-adic.
Indeed,
if,
for
H,
A
as
in
Deﬁnition
1.5,
0
=
f
∈
A(kH
)
lies
in
the
kernel
of
the
associated
Kummer
map,
then
observe
that
there
exists
some
ﬁnite
subset
I

⊆
I
such
that
if
we
set
def

k

=
Qp
(xi
)i∈I

,
then,
for
some
ﬁnite
extension
kH
⊆
kH
of
k

,
we
may
assume


,
that
f
∈
A
(kH

⊆
A(kH

that
A
descends
to
a



(xi



where
we

Since
kH
is
algebraically

and
that
kH

,
it
thus
follows
that
all
roots
of
f
deﬁned
over
kH
are
in
fact
deﬁned
over


.
Thus,
the
existence
of
f
contradicts
the
fact
that
the
sub-p-adic
ﬁeld
kH
is
kH
Kummer-faithful.
Finally,
to
see
that
k
is
not
sub-p-adic,
suppose
that
k
⊆
K,
where
K
is
a
ﬁnitely
generated
extension
of
an
MLF
K0
of
residue
characteristic
p0
such
that
K0
is
algebraically
closed
in
K.
Let
l
=
p,
p0
be
a
prime
number.
Then
Qp
⊇
k
∗
=
(k
×
)l
⊆
K
∗
=
N
def
(K
×
)l
⊆
K0
N
def

lN
—
where
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
the
additive
group
generated
by
k
∗
(respectively,
K
∗
)
in
k
(respectively,
K)
forms
a
compact
open
neighborhood
of
0
in
Qp
(respectively,
K0
).
In
particular,
it
follows
that
the
inclusion
k
→
K
determines
a
continuous
homomorphism
of
topological
ﬁelds
Qp
→
K0
.
But
this
implies
immediately
that
p0
=
p,
and
that
Qp
→
K0
is
a
Qp
-algebra
homomorphism.
Thus,
the
theory
of
transcendence
degree
yields
a
contradiction
[for
instance,
by
considering
the
morphism
on
Kähler
diﬀerentials
induced
by
k
→
K].
(iv)
One
veriﬁes
immediately
that
the
generalized
sub-p-adic
ﬁelds

are
not,
in

torally
Kummer-faithful.

In

suppose
further
that

Also,
for

let

[Thus,

Proof.
The
validity
of
the
algorithm
asserted
in
Theorem

is
immediate
from
the
various
results
cited
in
the
statement
of
this
algorithm.
Remark
1.9.1.
When
k
is
an
MLF
[cf.
[Mzk20],
§0],
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
one
may
give
a
tempered
version
of
Theorem
1.9
[cf.
[Mzk21],
Remark
3.7.1],
in
which
the
proﬁnite
étale
fundamental
group
ΠX
is
replaced
by
the
tempered
fundamental
group
of
X
[and
the
expression
“proﬁnite

is
replaced
by
“topological
group”].
Remark
1.9.2.
When
k
is
an
MLF
or
NF
[cf.
[Mzk20],

the
“extension

may
be
replaced
by
the

ΠX
[cf.

A
similar
remark
applies
in
the
tempered
case
discussed
in
Remark

Remark
1.9.3.
Note
that
unlike
the
case
with

KZNF
,
the
algorithm
of
Theorem
1.9
does
not
furnish
a
means
for
reconstructing
k,
KZ
in
general
—
cf.
Corollary
1.10
below
concerning
the
case
when
k

Remark
1.9.4.
Suppose
that

Then
Gk
,
which
is
of
cohomological
dimension

[cf.
[NSW],
Theorem

may
be
thought
of

may
be
thought
of
as
a
“rigid
dimension”.
On
the
other
hand,
the
Gunr
=
Z
k
dimension
of
Gk
represented
by
the
inertia
group
in
Ik
⊆
G
k
[which,
as
is
well-known,
is
of
cohomological
dimension
1]
is
“far
from
rigid”
—
a
phenomenon
that
may
be
seen,
for
instance,
in
the
existence
[cf.,
e.g.,
[NSW],
the
Closing
Remark
preceding
Theorem
12.2.7]
of
isomorphisms
of
absolute
Galois
groups
of
MLF’s
which
fail
[equivalently
—
cf.
[Mzk20],
Corollary
3.7]
to
be
“RFpreserving”,
“uniformly
toral”,
or
“geometric”.
By
contrast,
it
is
interesting
to
observe
that:
The
“group-theoretic”
algorithm
of
Theorem
1.9
shows
that
the
condition
of
being
“coupled
with
ΔX
”
[i.e.,
via
the
extension
determined
by
ΠX
]
has
the
eﬀect
of
rigidifying
both
of
the
2
dimensions
of
Gk
[cf.
also
Corollary
1.10
below].
This
point
of
view
will
be
of
use
in
our
development
of
the
archimedean
theory
in
§2
below
[cf.,
e.g.,
Remark
2.7.3
below].
Remark
1.9.5.
(i)
Note
that
the
functoriality
with
respect
to
isomorphisms
of
the
algorithm
of
Theorem
1.9
may
be
regarded
as
yielding
a
new
proof
of
the
“proﬁnite
absolute
version
of
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
over
number
ﬁelds”
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk15],
Theorem
3.4]
that
does
not
logically
depend
on
the
theorem
of
Neukirch-Uchida
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk15],
Theorem
3.1].
Moreover,
to
the
author’s
knowledge:
The
technique
of
Theorem
1.9
yields
the
ﬁrst
logically
independent
proof
of
a
consequence
of
the
theorem
of
Neukirch-Uchida
that
involves
an
explicit
construction
of
the
number
ﬁelds
involved.
Put
another
way,
the
algorithm
of
Theorem
1.9
yields
a
proof
of
a
consequence
of
the
theorem
of
Neukirch-Uchida
on
number
ﬁelds
in
the
style
of
Uchida’s
work
on
function
ﬁelds
in
positive
characteristic
[i.e.,
[Uchi]]
—
cf.,
especially,
Proposition
1.3.
(ii)
One
aspect
of
the
theorem
of
Neukirch-Uchida
is
that
its
proof
relies
essentially
on
the
data
arising
from
the
decomposition
of
primes
in
ﬁnite
extensions
of
a
number
ﬁeld
—
i.e.,
in
other
words,
on
the
“global
address”
of
a
prime
among
all
the
primes
of
a
number
ﬁeld.
Such
a
“global
address”
is
manifestly
annihilated
by
the
operation
of
localization
at
the
prime
under
consideration.
In
particular,
the
crucial
functoriality
of
Theorem
1.9
with
respect
to
change
of
base
ﬁeld
[e.g.,
from
a
number
ﬁeld
to
a
nonarchimedean
completion
of
the
number
ﬁeld]
is
another
reﬂection
of
the
way
in
which
the
nature
of
the
proof
of
Theorem
1.9
over
number
ﬁelds
diﬀers
quite
fundamentally
from
the
essentially
global
proof
of
the
theorem
of
Neukirch-Uchida
[cf.
also
Remark
3.7.6,
(iii),
(v),
below].
This
“crucial
functoriality”
may
also
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
essential
independence
of
the
algorithms
of
Theorem
1.9
from
both
methods
which
are
essentially
global
in
nature
40
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
[such
as
methods
involving
the
“global
address”
of
a
prime]
and
methods
which
are
essentially
local
in
nature
[such
as
methods
involving
p-adic
Hodge
theory
—
cf.
Remark
3.7.6,
(iii),
(v),
below].
This
point
of
view
concerning
the
“essential
independence
of
the
base
ﬁeld”
is
developed
further
in
Remark
1.9.7
below.
Remark
1.9.6.
By
combining
the
theory
of
the
present
§1
with
the
theory
of
[Mzk21],
§1
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk21],
Corollary
1.11
and
its
proof],
one
may
obtain
“functorial
group-theoretic
reconstruction
algorithms”,
in
a
number
of
cases,
for
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
conﬁguration
spaces
associated
to
hyperbolic
curves.
We
leave
the
routine
details
to
the
interested
reader.
Remark
1.9.7.
One
way
to
think
of
the
construction
algorithm
in
Theorem
1.9
of
the
“NF-portion
of
the
function
ﬁeld”
of
a
hyperbolic
orbicurve
of
strictly
Belyi
type
over
a
sub-p-adic
ﬁeld
is
the
following:
The
algorithm
of
Theorem
1.9
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
complete
“combinatorialization”
—
independent
of
the
base
ﬁeld!
—
of
the
[algebro-geometric
object
constituted
by
the]
orbicurve
under
consideration.
This
sort
of
“combinatorialization”
may
be
thought
of
as
being
in
a
similar
vein
—
albeit
much
more
technically
complicated!
—
to
the
“combinatorialization”
of
a
category
of
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
a
connected
scheme
via
the
notion
of
an
abstract
Galois
category,
or
the
“combinatorialization”
of
certain
aspects
of
the
commutative
algebra
of
“normal
rings
with
toral
singularities”
via
the
abstract
monoids
that
appear
in
the
theory
of
log
regular
schemes
[cf.
also
the
Introduction
of
[Mzk16]
for
more
on
this
point
of
view].
Remark
1.9.8.
Typically
in
discussions
of
anabelian
geometry,
the
term
“grouptheoretic”
is
applied
to
a
property
or
construction
that
is
preserved
by
the
isomorphisms
[or
homomorphisms]
of
fundamental
groups
under
consideration
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk5]].
By
contrast,
our
use
of
this
term
is
intended
in
a
stronger
sense.
That
is
to
say:
We
use
the
term
“group-theoretic
algorithm”
to
mean
that
the
algorithm
in
question
is
phrased
in
language
that
only
depends
on
the
topological
group
structure
of
the
fundamental
group
under
consideration.
[Thus,
the
more
“classical”
use
[e.g.,
in
[Mzk5]]
of
the
term
“group-theoretic”
corresponds,
in
our
discussion
of
“group-theoretic
algorithms”,
to
the
functoriality
—
e.g.,
with
respect
to
isomorphisms
of
some
type
—
of
the
algorithm.]
In
particular,
one
fundamental
diﬀerence
between
the
approach
usually
taken
to
anabelian
geometry
and
the
approach
taken
in
the
present
paper
is
the
following:
The
“classical”
approach
to
anabelian
geometry,
which
we
shall
refer
to
as
bi-anabelian,
centers
around
a
comparison
between
two
geometric
objects
[e.g.,
hyperbolic
orbicurves]
via
their
[arithmetic]
fundamental
TOPICS

groups.
By
contrast,
the
theory
of
the
present
paper,
which
we
shall
refer
to
as
mono-anabelian,
centers
around
the
task
of
establishing
“grouptheoretic
algorithms”
—
i.e.,
“group-theoretic
software”
—
that
require
as
input
data
only
the
[arithmetic]
fundamental
group
of
a
single
geometric
object.
Thus,
it
follows
formally
that
“mono-anabelian”
=⇒
“bi-anabelian”.
On
the
other
hand,
if
one
is
allowed
in
one’s
algorithms
to
introduce
some
ﬁxed
reference
model
of
the
geometric
object
under
consideration,
then
the
task
of
establishing
an
“algorithm”
may,
in
eﬀect,
be
reduced
to
“comparison
with
the
ﬁxed
reference
model”,
i.e.,
reduced
to
some
sort
of
result
in
“bi-anabelian
geometry”.
That
is
to
say,
if
one
is
unable
to
settle
the
issue
of
ruling
out
the
use
of
such
models,
then
there
remains
the
possibility
that
?
“bi-anabelian”
=⇒
“mono-anabelian”.
We
shall
return
to
this
crucial
issue
in
§3
below
[cf.,
especially,
Remark
3.7.3].
Remark
1.9.9.
As
was
pointed
out
to
the
author
by
M.
Kim,
one
may
also
think
of
the
algorithms
of
a
result
such
as
Theorem
1.9
as
suggesting
an
approach
to
solving
the
problem
of
characterizing
“group-theoretically”
those
proﬁnite
groups
Π
that
occur
[i.e.,
in
Theorem
1.9]
as
a
“ΠX
”.
That
is
to
say,
one
may
try
to
obtain
such
a
characterization
by
starting
with,
say,
an
arbitrary
slim
proﬁnite
group
Π
and
then
proceeding
to
impose
“group-theoretic”
conditions
on
Π
corresponding
to
the
various
steps
of
the
algorithms
of
Theorems
1.9
—
i.e.,
conditions
whose
content
consists
of
minimal
assumptions
on
Π
that
are
necessary
in
order
to
execute
each
step
of
the
algorithm.

In

The

of
as
a
sort
of
“synchronization

the
style
of
the
“synchronization

Theorem

(Semi-absolute

denotes
the

surjection
of

fundamental
groups
[relative
to
some
choice
of
basepoints],
and
ΔηX
denotes
the
kernel
of
this
surjection
—
the
resulting
extension
of
proﬁnite
groups.
Then
ΔηX
,
ΠηX
,
and
Gk
are
slim.
For
simplicity,
let
us
suppose
further
[for
instance,
by
replacing
X
by
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
X]
that
gX
≥
2.
Then
there
exists
a
functorial
“group-theoretic”
algorithm
for
reconstructing
the

KX
from
the
extension
of
proﬁnite
groups
1
→
ΔηX
→
ΠηX
→
Gk
→
1;
this
algorithm
consists
of
the
following
steps:
(a)
Let
l
be
a
prime
number.
If
ρ
:
Gk
→
Z×
l
is
a
character,
and
M
is
an
abelian
pro-l
group
equipped
with
a
continuous
action
by
Gk
,
then
let
us
write
Fρ
(M
)
⊆
M
for
the
closed
subgroup
topologically
generated
by
the
closed
subgroups
of
M
that
are
isomorphic
to
Zl
(ρ)
[i.e.,
the
Gk
module
obtained
by
letting
Gk
act
on
Zl
via
ρ]
as
H-modules,
for
some
open
subgroup
H
⊆
Gk
.
[Thus,
Fρ
(M
)
⊆
M
depends
only
on
the
“powerequivalence
class”
of
ρ
—
cf.
Remark
1.5.1.]
Then
the
power-equivalence
class
of
the
cyclotomic
character
χl
:
Gk
→
Z×
l
may
be
characterized
⊗
Z

not
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated.
by
the
condition
that
Fχl
(Δab
l

(b)
Let
l
be
a
prime
number.
If
M
is
an
abelian

group
equipped
with
a
continuous
action
by
Gk
such
that
M/Fχl
(M
)
is
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated,
then
let
us
write
M

T
(M
)
for
the
maximal
torsionfree
quasi-trivial
quotient
[i.e.,
maximal
torsion-free
quotient
on
which
Gk
acts
through
a
ﬁnite
quotient].
[Thus,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
“T
(M
)”
is
well-deﬁned.]
Then
one
may
compute
the
genus
of
X
via
the
formula
[cf.
the
proof
of
[Mzk21],
Corollary
2.10]
ab
2gX
=
dimQl
(Q(Δab
ηX
⊗
Zl
)
⊗
Ql
)
+
dimQl
(T
(ΔηX
⊗
Zl
)
⊗
Ql
)
def
—
where
we
write
Q(−)
=
(−)/Fχl
(−).
In
particular,
this
allows
one
to
characterize,
via
the
Hurwitz
formula,
those
pairs
of
open
subgroups
Ji
⊆
Hi
⊆
ΔηX
such
that
“the
covering
between
Ji
and
Hi
is
cyclic
of
order
a
power
of
l
and
totally
ramiﬁed
at
precisely
one
closed
point
but
unramiﬁed
elsewhere”
[cf.
the
proof
of
[Mzk21],
Corollary
2.10].
Moreover,
this
last
characterization
implies
a
“group-theoretic”
characterization
of
the
inertia
subgroups
Ix
⊆
ΔηX
of
points
x
∈
X(k)
[cf.
the
proof
of
[Mzk21],
Corollary
2.10;

portion

the

the
quotient
ΔηX

ΔX
[whose
kernel
is
topologically
normally
generated
by
the
Ix
,
for
x
∈
X(k)].
Finally,
the
decomposition
group
Dx
⊆
ΠηX
of
x
∈
X(k)
may
then
be
constructed
as
the
normalizer
[or,
equivalently,
commensurator]
of
Ix

respect
to
arbitrary
open
injective
homomorphisms
of

[cf.
Remark
1.10.1,

Proof.
The
slimness
of
ΔηX
follows
immediately
from
the
argument
applied
to
verify
the
slimness
portion
of
[Mzk21],
Corollary
2.10.
The
validity
of
the
reconstruction
algorithm
asserted
in
Theorem
1.11
is
immediate
from
the
various
results
cited
in
the
statement
of
this
algorithm.
Now,
by
applying
the
functoriality
of
this
algorithm,
the
slimness
of
Gk
follows
immediately
from
the
argument
applied
in
[Mzk5],
Lemma
15.8,
to
verify
the
slimness
of
Gk
when
k
is
sub-p-adic.
Finally,
the
slimness
of
ΠηX
follows
from
the
slimness
of
ΔηX
,
Gk
.
Remark
1.11.1.
(i)
One
veriﬁes
immediately
that
when
k
is
an
MLF,
the
semi-absolute
algorithms
of
Theorem
1.11
may
be
rendered
absolute
[i.e.,
one
may
construct
the
kernel
of
the
quotient
“ΠηX

Gk
”]
by
applying
the
algorithm
that
is
implicit
in
the
proof
of
the
corresponding
portion
of
[Mzk21],
Corollary
2.10.
(ii)
Suppose,
in
the
notation
of
Theorem
1.11
that
k
is
an
NF.
Then
an
absolute
version
of
the
functoriality
portion
[i.e.,
the
“Grothendieck
Conjecture”
portion]
of
Theorem
1.11
is
proven
in
[Pop]
[cf.
[Pop],
Theorem
2].
Moreover,
in
[Pop],
Observation
[and
the
following
discussion],
an
algorithm
is
given
for
passing
from
the
absolute
data
“ΠηX
”
to
the
semi-absolute
data
“(ΠηX
,
ΔηX
⊆
ΠηX
)”.
Thus,
by
combining
this
algorithm
of
[Pop]
with
Theorem
1.11,
one
obtains
an
absolute
version
of
Theorem
1.11.
Remark
1.11.2.
One
may
think
of
the
argument
used
to
prove
the
slimness
of
Gk
in
the
proof
of
Theorem
1.11
[i.e.,
the
argument
of
the
proof
of
[Mzk5],
Lemma
15.8]
as
being
similar
in
spirit
to
the
proof
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk9],
Theorem
1.1.1,
(ii)]
of
the
slimness
of
Gk
via
local
class
ﬁeld
theory
in
the
case
where
k
is
an
MLF,
as
well
as
to
the
proof
of
the
slimness
of
the
geometric
fundamental
group
of
a
hyperbolic
curve
given,
for
instance,
in
[MT],
Proposition
1.4,
via
the
induced
action
on
the
48
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
torsion
points
of
the
Jacobian
of
the
curve,
in
which
the
curve
may
be
embedded.
That
is
to
say,
in
the
case
where
k
is
an
arbitrary
Kummer-faithful
ﬁeld,
since
one
does
not
have
an
analogue
of
local
class
ﬁeld
theory
(respectively,
of
the
embedding
of
a
curve
in
its
Jacobian),
the
moduli
of
hyperbolic
curves
over
k,
in
the
context
of
a
relative
anabelian
result
for
the
arithmetic
fundamental
groups
of
such
curves,
plays
the
role
of
the
abelianization
of
Gk
(respectively,
of
the
torsion
points
of
the
Jacobian)
in
the
case
where
k
is
an
MLF
(respectively,
in
the
case
of
the
geometric
fundamental
group
of
a
hyperbolic
curve)
—
i.e.,
the
role
of
a
“functorial,
grouptheoretically
reconstructible
embedding”
of
k
(respectively,
the
curve).
Remark
1.11.3.
It
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
techniques
that
appear
in
the
algorithms
of
Theorem
1.11
are
extremely
elementary.
For
instance,
unlike
the
case
with
Theorem
1.9,
Corollary
1.10,
the
algorithms
of
Theorem
1.11
do
not
depend
on
the
somewhat
diﬃcult
[e.g.,
in
their
use
of
p-adic
Hodge
theory]
results
of
[Mzk5].
Put
another
way,
this
elementary
nature
of
Theorem
1.11
serves
to
highlight
the
fact
that
the
only
non-elementary
portion
[in
the
sense
of
its
dependence
of
the
results
of
[Mzk5]]
of
the
algorithms
of
Theorem
1.9
is
the
use
of
the
technique
of
Belyi
cuspidalizations.
It
is
precisely
this
“non-elementary
portion”
of
Theorem
1.9
that
requires
us,
in
Theorem
1.9,
to
assume
that
the
base
ﬁeld
is
sub-p-adic
[i.e.,
as
opposed
to
merely
Kummer-faithful,
as
in
Theorem
1.11].
Remark
1.11.4.
(i)
The
observation
of
Remark
1.11.3
prompts
the
following
question:
If
the
birational
version
[i.e.,
Theorem
1.11]
of
Theorem
1.9
is
so
much
more
elementary
than
Theorem
1.9,
then
what
is
the
advantage
[i.e.,
relative
to
the
anabelian
geometry
of
function
ﬁelds]
of
considering
the
anabelian
geometry
of
hyperbolic
curves?
One
key
advantage
of
working
with
hyperbolic
curves,
in
the
context
of
the
theory
of
the
present
paper,
lies
in
the
fact
that
“most”
hyperbolic
curves
admit
a
core
[cf.
[Mzk3],
§3;
[Mzk10],
§2].
Moreover,
the
existence
of
“cores”
at
the
level
of
schemes
has
a
tendency
to
imply
to
existence
of
“cores”
at
the
level
of
“étale
fundamental
groups
considered
geometrically”,
i.e.,
at
the
level
of
anabelioids
[cf.
[Mzk11],
§3.1].
The
existence
of
a
core
is
crucial
to,
for
instance,
the
theory
of
the
étale
theta
function
given
in
[Mzk18],
§1,
§2,
and,
moreover,
in
the
present
three-part
series,
plays
an
important
role
in
the
theory
of
elliptically
admissible
[cf.
[Mzk21],
Deﬁnition
3.1]
hyperbolic
orbicurves.
On
the
other
hand,
it
is
easy
to
see
that
“function
ﬁelds
do
not
admit
cores”:
i.e.,
if,
in
the
notation
of
Theorem
1.11,
we
write
Loc(ηX
)
for
the
category
whose
objects
are
connected
schemes
that
admit
a
connected
ﬁnite
étale
covering
which
is
also
a
connected
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
ηX
,
and
whose
morphisms
are
the
ﬁnite
étale
morphisms,
then
Loc(ηX
)
fails
to
admit
a
terminal
object.
(ii)
The
observation
of
(i)
is
interesting
in
the
context
of
the
theory
of
§5
below,
in
which
we
apply
various
[mono-]anabelian
results
to
construct
“canonical
rigid
integral
structures”
called
“log-shells”.
Indeed,
in
the
Introduction
to
TOPICS
IN
ABSOLUTE
ANABELIAN
GEOMETRY
III
49
[Mzk11],
it
is
explained,
via
analogy
to
the
complex
analytic
theory
of
the
upper
half-plane,
how
the
notion
of
a
core
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“canonical
integral
structure”
—
i.e.,
relative
to
the
“modiﬁcations
of
integral
structure”
constituted
by
“going
up
and
down
via
various
ﬁnite
étale
coverings”.
Here,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
this
idea
of
a
“canonical
integral
structure
relative
to
going
up
and
down
via
ﬁnite
étale
coverings”
may
also
be
seen
in
the
theory
surrounding
the
property
of
cyclotomic
rigidity
in
the
context
of
the
étale
theta
function
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk18],
Remark
2.19.3].
Moreover,
let
us
observe
that
these
“integral
structures
with
respect
to
ﬁnite
étale
coverings”
may
be
thought
of
as
“exponentiated
integral
structures”
—
i.e.,
in
the
sense
that,
for
instance,
in
the
case
of
Gm
over
Q,
these
integral
structures
are
not
integral
structures
relative
to
the
scheme-theoretic
base
ring
Z
⊆
Q,
but
rather
with
respect
to
the
exponent
of
the
standard
coordinate
U
,
which,
via
multiplication
by
various
nonnegative
integers
N
,
gives
rise,
in
the
form
of
mappings
U
n
→
U
N
·n
,
to
various
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
Gm
.
Such
“non-schemetheoretic
exponentiated
copies
of
Z”
play
an
important
role
in
the
theory
of
the
étale
theta
function
as
the
Galois
group
of
a
certain
natural
inﬁnite
étale
covering
of
the
Tate
curve
—
cf.
the
discussion
of
[Mzk18],
Remark
2.16.2.
Moreover,
the
idea
of
constructing
“canonical
integral
structures”
by
“de-exponentiating
certain
exponentiated
integral
structures”
may
be
rephrased
as
the
idea
of
“constructing
canonical
integral
structures
by
applying
some
sort
of
logarithm
operation”.
From
this
point
of
view,
such
“canonical
integral
structures
with
respect
to
ﬁnite
étale
coverings”
are
quite
reminiscent
of
the
canonical
integral
structures
arising
from
log-shells
to
be
constructed
in
§5
below.
Remark
1.11.5.
In
the
context
of
the
discussion
of
Remark
1.11.4,
if
the
hyperbolic
curve
in
question
is
aﬃne,
then,
relative
to
the
function
ﬁeld
of
the
curve,
the
additional
data
necessary
to
determine
the
given
aﬃne
hyperbolic
curve
consists
precisely
of
some
[nonempty]
ﬁnite
collection
of
conjugacy
classes
of
inertia
groups
[i.e.,
“Ix
”
as
in
Theorem
11.1,
(b)].
Thus,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
discussion
of
Remark
1.11.3,
the
technique
of
Belyi
cuspidalizations
is
applied
precisely
so
as
to
enable
one
to
work
with
this
additional
data
[cf.
also
the
discussion
of
Remark
3.7.7
below].

SHINICHI

Section
2:
Archimedean
Reconstruction
Algorithms
In
the
present
§2,
we
re-examine
various
aspects
of
the
complex
analytic
theory
of
[Mzk14]
from
an
algorithm-based,
“model-implicit”
[cf.
Remark
2.7.4
below]
point
of
view
motivated
by
the
Galois-theoretic
theory
of
§1.
More
precisely,
the
“SL2
(R)-based
approach”
of
[Mzk14],
§1,
may
be
seen
in
the
general
theory
of
Aut-holomorphic
spaces
given
in
Proposition
2.2,
Corollary
2.3,
while
the
“parallelograms,
rectangles,
squares
approach”
of
[Mzk14],
§2,
is
developed
further
in
the
reconstruction
algorithms
of
Propositions
2.5,
2.6.
These
two
approaches
are
combined
to
obtain
the
main
result
of
the
present
§2
[cf.
Corollary
2.7],
which
consists
of
a
certain
reconstruction
algorithm
for
the
“local
linear
holomorphic
structure”
of
an
Aut-holomorphic
orbispace
arising
from
an
elliptically
admissible
hyperbolic
orbicurve.
Finally,
in
Corollaries
2.8,
2.9,
we
consider
the
relationship
between
Corollary
2.7
and
the
global
portion
of
the
Galois-theoretic
theory
of
§1.
The
following
deﬁnition
will
play
an
important
role
in
the
theory
of
the
present
§2.
Deﬁnition
2.1.
(i)
Let
X
be
a
Riemann
surface
[i.e.,
a
complex
manifold
of
dimension
one].
Write
AX
for
the
assignment
that
assigns
to
each
connected
open
subset
U
⊆
X
the
group
def
AX
(U
)
=
Authol
(U
)
of
holomorphic
automorphisms
of
U
—
which
we
think
of
as
being
“some
distinguished
subgroup”
of
the
group
of
self-homeomorphisms
Aut(U
top
)
of
the
underlying
topological
space
U
top
of
U
.
We
shall
refer
to
as
the
Aut-holomorphic
space
associated
to
X
the
pair
def
X
=
(Xtop
,
AX
)
def
consisting
of
the
underlying
topological
space
Xtop
=
X
top
of
X,
together
with
the
def
assignment
AX
=
AX
;
also,
we
shall
refer
to
the
assignment
AX
=
AX
as
the
Autholomorphic
structure
on
Xtop
=
X
top
[determined
by
X].
If
X
is
biholomorphic
to
the
open
unit
disc,
then
we
shall
refer
to
X
as
an
Aut-holomorphic
disc.
If
X
is
a
hyperbolic
Riemann
surface
of
ﬁnite
type
(respectively,
a
hyperbolic
Riemann
surface
of
ﬁnite
type
associated
to
an
elliptically
admissible
[cf.
[Mzk21],
Deﬁnition
3.1]
hyperbolic
curve
over
C),
then
we
shall
refer
to
the
Aut-holomorphic
space
X
as
hyperbolic
of
ﬁnite
type
(respectively,
elliptically
admissible).
If
U
is
a
collection
of
connected
open
subsets
of
X
that
forms
a
basis
for
the
topology
of
X
and,
moreover,
satisﬁes
the
condition
that
any
connected
open
subset
of
X
that
is
contained
in
an
element
of
U
is
itself
an
element
of
U
,
then
we
shall
refer
to
U
as
a
local
structure
on
X
top
and
to
the
restriction
AX
|U
of
AX
to
U
as
a
[U-local]
pre-Aut-holomorphic
structure
on
X
top
.
(ii)
Let
X
(respectively,
Y
)
be
a
Riemann
surface;
X
(respectively,
Y)
the
Aut-holomorphic
space
associated
to
X
(respectively,
Y
);
U
(respectively,
V)
a
local
structure
on
Xtop
(respectively,
Ytop
).
Then
we
shall
refer
to
as
a
(U,
V)-local
morphism
of
Aut-holomorphic
spaces
φ:X→Y
TOPICS

any
local
isomorphism
of
topological
spaces
φtop
:
Xtop
→
Ytop
with
the
property
that
for
any
open
subset
UX
∈
U
that
maps
homeomorphically
via
φtop
onto
some
∼
open
subset
UY
∈
V,
φtop
induces
a
bijection
AX
(UX
)
→
AY
(UY
);
when
U,
V
are,
respectively,
the
sets
of
all
connected
open
subsets
of
X,
Y
,
then
we
shall
omit
the
word
“(U
,
V)-local”
from
this
terminology;
when
φtop
is
a
ﬁnite
covering
space
map,
we
shall
say
that
φ
is
ﬁnite
étale.
We
shall
refer
to
a
map
X
→
Y
which
is
either
holomorphic
or
anti-holomorphic
at
each
point
of
X
as
an
RC-holomorphic
morphism
[cf.
[Mzk14],
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(vi)].
(iii)
Let
Z,
Z

be
orientable
topological
surfaces
[i.e.,
two-manifolds].
If
p
∈
Z,
then
let
us
write
def
ab
Orn(Z,
p)
=
lim
−→
π1
(W
\{p})
W
—
where
W
ranges
over
the
connected
open
neighborhoods
of
p
in
Z;
“π1
(−)”
denotes
the
usual
topological
fundamental
group,
relative
to
some
basepoint
[so
“π1
(−)”
is
only
deﬁned
up
to
inner
automorphisms,
an
indeterminacy
which
may
be
eliminated
by
passing
to
the
abelianization
“ab”];
thus,
Orn(Z,
p)
is
[noncanonically!]
isomorphic
to
Z.
Note
that
since
Z
is
orientable,
it
follows
that
the
assignment
p
→
Orn(Z,
p)
determines
a
trivial
local
system
on
Z,
whose
module
of
global
sections
we
shall
denote
by
Orn(Z)
[so
Orn(Z)
is
a
direct
product
of
copies
of
Z,
indexed
by
the
connected
components
of
Z].
One
veriﬁes
immediately
that
any
local
isomorphism
Z
→
Z

induces
a
well-deﬁned
homomorphism
Orn(Z)
→
Orn(Z

).
We
shall
say
that
any
two
local
isomorphisms
α,
β
:
Z
→
Z

are
co-oriented
if
they
induce
the
same
homomorphism
Orn(Z)
→
Orn(Z

).
We
shall
refer
to
as
a
pre-co-orientation
ζ
:
Z
→
Z

any
equivalence
class
of
local
isomorphisms
Z
→
Z

relative
to
the
equivalence
relation
determined
by
the
property
of
being
co-oriented
[so
a
pre-co-orientation
may
be
thought
of
as
a
collection
of
maps
Z
→
Z

,
or,
alternatively,
as
a
homomorphism
Orn(Z)
→
Orn(Z

)].
Thus,
the
pre-co-orientations
from
the
open
subsets
of
Z
to
Z

form
a
pre-sheaf
on
Z;
we
shall
refer
to
as
a
co-orientation
ζ
:
Z
→
Z
any
section
of
the
sheaﬁﬁcation
of
this
pre-sheaf
[so
a
co-orientation
may
be
thought
of
as
a
collection
of
maps
from
open
subsets
of
Z
to
Z

,
or,
alternatively,
as
a
homomorphism
Orn(Z)
→
Orn(Z

)].
(iv)
Let
X,
Y
,
X,
Y,
U,
V
be
as
in
(ii).
Then
we
shall
say
that
two
(U,
V)-local
morphisms
of
Aut-holomorphic
spaces
φ1
,
φ2
:
X
→
Y
are
co-holomorphic
if
φtop
1
and
φtop
are
co-oriented
[cf.
(iii)].
We
shall
refer
to
as
a
pre-co-holomorphicization
2
ζ
:
X
→
Y
any
equivalence
class
of
(U,
V)-local
morphisms
of
Aut-holomorphic
spaces
X
→
Y
relative
to
the
equivalence
relation
determined
by
the
property
of
being
co-holomorphic
[so
a
pre-co-holomorphicization
may
be
thought
of
as
a
collection
of
maps
from
Xtop
to
Ytop
].
Thus,
the
pre-co-holomorphicizations
from
the
Aut-holomorphic
spaces
determined
by
open
subsets
of
Xtop
to
Y
form
a
presheaf
on
Xtop
;
we
shall
refer
to
as
a
co-holomorphicization
[cf.
also
Remark
2.3.2
below]
ζ:X→Y
any
section
of
the
sheaﬁﬁcation
of
this
pre-sheaf
[so
a
co-holomorphicization
may
be
thought
of
as
a
collection
of
maps
from
open
subsets
of
Xtop
to
Ytop
].
Finally,
we
52
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
observe
that
every
co-holomorphicization
(respectively,
pre-co-holomorphicization)
determines
a
co-orientation
(pre-co-orientation)
between
the
underlying
topological
spaces.
Remark
2.1.1.
One
veriﬁes
immediately
that
there
is
a
natural
extension
of
the
notions
of
Deﬁnition
2.1
to
the
case
of
Riemann
orbisurfaces,
which
give
rise
to
“Aut-holomorphic
orbispaces”
[not
to
be
confused
with
the
“orbi-objects”
of
§0,
which
will
always
be
identiﬁable
in
the
present
paper
by
means
of
the
hyphen
“-”
following
the
preﬁx
“orbi”].
Here,
we
understand
the
term
“Riemann
orbisurface”
to
refer
to
a
one-dimensional
complex
analytic
stack
which
is
locally
isomorphic
to
the
complex
analytic
stack
obtained
by
forming
the
stack-theoretic
quotient
of
a
Riemann
surface
[i.e.,
a
one-dimensional
complex
manifold]
by
a
ﬁnite
group
of
[holomorphic]
automorphisms
[of
the
Riemann
surface].
In
particular,
a
“Riemann
orbiface”
is
necessarily
a
Riemann
surface
over
the
complement,
in
the
“coarse
space”
associated
to
the
orbisurface,
of
some
discrete
closed
subset.
Remark
2.1.2.
One
important
aspect
of
the
“Aut-holomorphic”
approach
to
the
notion
of
a
“holomorphic
structure”
is
that
this
approach
has
the
virtue
of
being
free
of
any
mention
of
some
“ﬁxed
reference
model”
copy
of
the
ﬁeld
of
complex
numbers
C
—
cf.
Remark
2.7.4
below.
Proposition
2.2.
(Commensurable
Terminality
of
RC-Holomorphic
Automorphisms
of
the
Disc)
Let
X,
Y
be
Aut-holomorphic
discs,
arising,
respectively,
from
Riemann
surfaces
X,
Y
.
Then:
∼
(i)
Every
isomorphism
of
Aut-holomorphic
spaces
X
→
Y
arises
from
a
∼
unique
RC-holomorphic
isomorphism
X
→
Y
.
(ii)
Let
us
regard
the
group
Aut(X
top
)
as
equipped
with
the
compact-open
topology.
Then
the
subgroup
AutRC-hol
(X)
⊆
Aut(X
top
)
of
RC-holomorphic
automorphisms
of
X,
which
[as
is
well-known]
contains
Authol
(X)
as
a
subgroup
of
index
two,
is
closed
and
commensurably
terminal
[cf.
[Mzk20],
§0].
Moreover,
we
have
isomorphisms
of
topological
groups
Authol
(X)
∼
=
SL2
(R)/{±1};
AutRC-hol
(X)
∼
=
GL2
(R)/R×
[where
we
regard
Authol
(X),
AutRC-hol
(X),
as
equipped
with
the
topology
induced
by
the
topology
of
Aut(X
top
),
i.e.,
the
compact-open
topology].
Proof.
It
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
assertion
(i)
follows
formally
from
the
commensurable
terminality
[in
fact,
in
this
situation,
normal
terminality
suﬃces]
of
assertion
(ii).
Thus,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
assertion
(ii).
First,
we
recall
that
we
have
a
natural
isomorphism
of
connected
topological
groups
Authol
(X)
∼
=
SL2
(R)/{±1}
TOPICS
IN
ABSOLUTE
ANABELIAN
GEOMETRY
III
53
[where
we
regard
Authol
(X)
as
equipped
with
the
compact-open
topology].
Next,
let
us
recall
the
well-known
fact
in
elementary
complex
analysis
that
“a
sequence
of
holomorphic
functions
on
X
top
that
converges
uniformly
on
compact
subsets
of
X
top
converges
to
a
holomorphic
function
on
X
top
”.
[This
fact
is
often
applied
in
proofs
of
the
Riemann
mapping
theorem.]
This
fact
implies
immediately
that
Authol
(X),
AutRC-hol
(X)
are
closed
in
Aut(X
top
).
Now
suppose
that
α
∈
Aut(X
top
)
lies
in
the
commensurator
of
Authol
(X);
thus,
the
intersection
(α
·
Authol
(X)·α−1
)
Authol
(X)
is
a
closed
subgroup
of
ﬁnite
index
of
Authol
(X).
But
this
implies
that
(α·Authol
(X)·α−1
)
Authol
(X)
is
an
open
subgroup
of
Authol
(X),
hence
[since
Authol
(X)
is
connected]
that
(α
·
Authol
(X)
·
α−1
)
Authol
(X)
=
Authol
(X),
i.e.,
that
α
·
Authol
(X)
·
α−1
⊇
Authol
(X).
Thus,
by
replacing
α
by
α−1
,
we
conclude
that
α
normalizes
Authol
(X),
i.e.,
that
α
induces
an
automorphism
of
the
topological
group
Authol
(X)
∼
=
SL2
(R)/{±1},
hence
also
[by
Cartan’s
theorem

Chapter
V,

2;
the
proof
of
[Mzk14],
Lemma
1.10]
of
the
real
analytic
Lie
group
SL2
(R)/{±1}.
Thus,
as
is
well-known,
it
follows
[for
instance,
by
considering
the
action
of
α
on
the
Borel
subalgebras
of
the
complexiﬁcation
of
the
Lie
algebra
of
SL2
(R)/{±1}]
that
α
arises
from
an
element
of
GL2
(C)/C×
that
ﬁxes
[relative
to
the
action
by
conjugation]
the
Lie
subalgebra
sl2
(R)
of
sl2
(C).
But
such
an
element
of
GL2
(C)/C×
is
easily
veriﬁed
to
be
an
element
of
GL2
(R)/R×
.
In
particular,
by
considering
the
action
of
α
on
maximal
compact
subgroups
of
Authol
(X)
[cf.
the
proof
of
[Mzk14],
Lemma
1.10],
it
follows
that
α
arises
from
an
RC-holomorphic
automorphism
of
X,
as
desired.
In
fact,
as
the
following
result
shows,
the
notions
of
an
Aut-holomorphic
structure
and
a
pre-Aut-holomorphic
structure
are
equivalent
to
one
another,
as
well
as
to
the
usual
notion
of
a
“holomorphic
structure”.
Corollary
2.3.
(Morphisms
of
Aut-Holomorphic
Spaces)
Let
X
(respectively,
Y
)
be
a
Riemann
surface;
X
(respectively,
Y)
the
Aut-holomorphic
space
associated
to
X
(respectively,
Y
);
U
(respectively,
V)
a
local
structure
on
Xtop
(respectively,
Ytop
).
Then:
(i)
Every
(U
,
V)-local
morphism
of
Aut-holomorphic
spaces
φ:X→Y
arises
from
a
unique
étale
RC-holomorphic
morphism
ψ
:
X
→
Y
.
Moreover,
if,
in
this
situation,
X,
Y
[i.e.,
Xtop
,
Ytop
]
are
connected,
then
there
exist
precisely
two
co-holomorphicizations
X
→
Y,
corresponding
to
the
holomorphic
and
anti-holomorphic
local
isomorphisms
from
open
subsets
of
X
to
Y
.
(ii)
Every
pre-Aut-holomorphic
structure
on
Xtop
extends
to
a
unique
Aut-holomorphic
structure
on
Xtop
.
Proof.
Assertion
(i)
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions,
by
applying
Proposition
2.2,
(i),
to
suﬃciently
small
open
discs
in
Xtop
.
Assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
assertion
(i)
by
applying
assertion
(i)
to
automorphisms
of
the
Aut-holomorphic
spaces
determined
by
arbitrary
connected
open
subsets
of
Xtop
which
determine
the
same
co-holomorphicization
as
the
identity
automorphism.

It

from

that
[in

the

in

that
any

Corollary
2.4.
(Holomorphic
Arithmeticity
and
Cores)
Let
X
be
a
hyperbolic
Aut-holomorphic
space
of
ﬁnite
type
associated
to
a
Riemann
surface
X
[which
is,
in
turn,
determined
by
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
C].
Then
one
may
determine
the
arithmeticity
[in
the
sense
of
[Mzk3],
§2]
of
X
and,
when
X
is
not
arithmetic,
construct
the
Aut-holomorphic
orbispace
[cf.
Remark
2.1.1]
associated
to
the
hyperbolic
core
[cf.
[Mzk3],
Deﬁnition
3.1]
of
X,
via
the
following
functorial
algorithm,
which
involves
only
the
Aut-holomorphic
space
X
as
input
data:
(a)
Let
Utop
→
Xtop
be
any
universal
covering
of
Xtop
[i.e.,
a
connected
covering
space
of
the
topological
space
Xtop
which
does
not
admit
any
nontrivial
connected
covering
spaces].
Then
one
may
construct
the
fundamental
group
π1
(Xtop
)
as
the
group
of
automorphisms
Aut(Utop
/Xtop
)
of
Utop
over
Xtop
.
(b)
In
the
notation
of
(a),
by
considering
the
local
structure
on
Utop
consisting
of
connected
open
subsets
of
Utop
that
map
isomorphically
onto
open
subsets
of
Xtop
,
one
may
construct
a
natural
pre-Aut-holomorphic
structure
on
Utop
—
hence
also
[cf.
Corollary
2.3,
(ii)]
a
natural
Autholomorphic
structure
on
Utop
—
by
restricting
the
Aut-holomorphic
structure
of
X
on
Xtop
;
denote
the
resulting
Aut-holomorphic
space
by
U.
Thus,
we
obtain
a
natural
injection
π1
(Xtop
)
=
Aut(Utop
/Xtop
)
→
Aut0
(U)
⊆
Aut(U)
—
where
we
recall
[cf.
Proposition
2.2,
(ii);
Corollary
2.3,
(i)]
that
Aut(U),
equipped
with
the
compact-open
topology,
is
isomorphic,
as
a
topological
group,
to
GL2
(R)/R×
;
we
write
Aut0
(U)
⊆
Aut(U)
for
the
connected
component
of
the
identity
of
Aut(U).
(c)
In
the
notation
of
(b),
X
is
not
arithmetic
if
and
only
if
the
image
of
π1
(Xtop
)
in
Aut0
(U)
is
of
ﬁnite
index
in
its
commensurator
Π

(U)
in

[cf.

If
X
is
not
arithmetic,
then
the
Aut-holomorphic
orbispace
X→H
associated
to
the
hyperbolic
core
H
of
X
may
be
constructed
by
forming
the
“orbispace
quotient”
of
Utop
by
Π
and
equipping
this
quotient
with
the
pre-Aut-holomorphic
structure
—
which
[cf.
Corollary
2.3,
(ii)]
determines
a
unique
Aut-holomorphic
structure
—
determined
by
restricting
the
Aut-holomorphic
structure
of
U
to
some
suitable
local
structure
as
in
(b).
Finally,
the
asserted
“functoriality”
is
with
respect
to
ﬁnite
étale
morphisms
of
Aut-holomorphic
spaces
arising
from
hyperbolic
curves
over
C.
Proof.
The
validity
of
the
algorithm
asserted
in
Corollary
2.4
is
immediate
from
the
constructions
that
appear
in
the
statement
of
this
algorithm
[together
with
the
references
quoted
in
these
constructions].
Remark
2.4.1.
One
veriﬁes
immediately
that
Corollary
2.4
admits
a
natural
extension
to
the
case
where
X
arises
from
a
hyperbolic
orbicurve
over
C
[cf.
Remark
2.1.1].
Remark
2.4.2.
Relative
to
the
analogy
with
the
theory
of
§1
[cf.
Remark
2.7.3
below],
Corollary
2.4
may
be
regarded
as
a
sort
of
holomorphic
analogue
of
results
such
as
[Mzk10],
Theorem
2.4,
concerning
categories
of
ﬁnite
étale
localizations
of
hyperbolic
orbicurves.
Next,
we
turn
our
attention
to
re-examining,
from
an
algorithm-based
point
of
view,
the
theory
of
aﬃne
linear
structures
on
Riemann
surfaces
in
the
style
of
[Mzk14],
§2;
[Mzk14],

Following
the
terminology
of
[Mzk14],
Deﬁnition

we
shall
refer
to
as
“parallelograms”,

[in

[which
clearly
forms
a

for,

determines,
the

—
as
follows:
(a)
Deﬁne
a
strict
line
segment
L
of
U
to
be
an
intersection
of
the
form
def
L
=
Q1

are
the
respective

of

Q1
Q2
=
∅;
L
is
of

Deﬁne
two

if
their

Then
one
constructs
the
[closed,

line

of

by
observing
that
a
line
segment
may
be
characterized
as
the
union
of

contained

an

a

relative
to
the

on

and
the

(c)
Deﬁne
a

there

If
∂P
is

then
deﬁne

shall
refer

suppose
further
that

—

For

write

for

that
are

and
preserve
the

[at

of

Also,
we
equip
Ap
with
the
topology
induced
by
the
topologies
of
the
open

of

that
Ap
acts
on;
note
that
the
“local

of
Proposition
2.5,

determine
an

hence
also
a

If
p
is
suﬃciently
close
to
p,
then
the
“local

of
Proposition
2.5,
(e),
determine
homeomorphisms
[by
“translation”,
i.e.,
“addition”]
from
suﬃciently
small
neighborhoods
of
p
onto
suﬃciently
small
neighborhoods
of
p
;
these
homeomorphisms
thus
induce
∼
the
desired
isomorphism
Ap

.
Now,
by
joining
an
arbitrary
p
to
p
via
a

of
“suﬃciently

and
composing
the

one

tains
the

Finally,
this
isomorphism
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
a

of
“suﬃciently

used
in
its
construction.
Finally,
the
asserted
“functoriality”
is
to
be
understood
in
the
same
sense
as
in
Proposition
2.5.
Proof.
The
validity
of
the

is
immediate
from
the
elementary
content
of
the

Thus,
the

may
be
regarded
as
superseding
the
techniques
applied
in
the

of

Moreover,
just
as
the

one
may
apply
the

(Local

Holomorphic
Elliptic
Cuspidalization)
Let
X
be
an
elliptically
admissible
Aut-holomorphic
orbispace
[cf.
Remark
2.1.1]
associated
to
a
Riemann
orbisurface
X.
Then
there
exists
a
functorial
algorithm
for
constructing
the
“local

holomorphic
structure”
[cf.
Proposition
2.6]
on
Xtop
that
involves
only
the
Autholomorphic
space
X
as
input
data,
as
follows:
(a)
By
the
deﬁnition
of
“elliptically
admissible”,
we
may
apply
Corollary
2.4,
(c),
to
construct
the
[Aut-holomorphic
orbispace
associated
to
the]
semi-elliptic
hyperbolic
core
X

H
of
X
[i.e.,
X],
together
with
the
unique
[cf.
[Mzk21],
Remark

double
covering
E

H
by
an
Autholomorphic
space
[i.e.,
the
covering
determined
by
the
unique
torsionfree
subgroup
of

of
the

Π
of

is
the

E

U,
U

E
are
co-holomorphic
—
one
may
construct
the
torsion
points
of
[the
elliptic
curve
determined
by]
E
as
the
points
in
the
complement
of
the
image
of
such
morphisms
U

E,
together
with
the
group
structure
on
these
torsion
points
[which
is
induced
by
the
group
structure
of
the
Galois
group
Gal(U/E)].
(c)
Since
the
torsion
points
of
(b)
are
dense
in
Etop
,
one
may
construct
the
group
structure
on
[the
one-point
compactiﬁcation
of
]
Etop
[that
arises
from
the
elliptic
curve
determined
by
E]
as
the
unique
topological
group
structure
that
extends
the
group
structure
on
the
torsion
points
of
(b).
This
group
structure
determines
“local
additive
structures”
[cf.
Proposition
2.5,
(e)]
at
the
various
points
of
Etop
.
Moreover,
by
considering
one-parameter
subgroups
of
these
local
additive
group
structures,
one
constructs
the
line
segments
[cf.
Proposition
2.5,
(a)]
of
Etop
;
by
considering
translations
of
line
segments,
relative
to
these
local
additive
group
structures,
one
constructs
the
pairs
of
parallel
line
segments
[cf.
Proposition
2.5,
(b)]
of
Etop
,
hence
also
the
parallelograms,
frames,
and
orientations
[cf.
Proposition
2.5,
(c),
(d)]
of
Etop
.
(d)
Let
V
be
the
Aut-holomorphic
space
determined
by
a
parallelogram
Vtop
⊆
Etop
[cf.
(c)].
Then
the
one-parameter
subgroups
of
the
[topological]
group
AV
(Vtop
)
[∼

—
cf.
Proposition
2.2,
(ii);
Corollary
2.3,

the

are
precisely
the
closed
connected
subgroups
for
which
the
complement
of
some
connected
open

of
the

element
fails
to
be

If
S
is
a
one-parameter

of
AV

p
∈
Vtop
,
and
L
is
a
line
segment
one
of
whose
endpoints
is
equal
to
p,
then
L
is
tangent
to
S
·
p
at
p
if
and
only
if
any
pairs
of
sequences
of
points
of
L\{p},
(S

converge
to
the

determined
by
identifying
positive
real
multiples
of
elements
of

relative

the
local

at
p.
In
particular,
one
may
construct
the
orthogonal

as
the
frames
consisting
of
pairs

[i.e.,

(e)
For

write
Ap
for
the
group
of
automorphisms
of
the

system
of

of

that
are

and
preserve
the

[cf.

Then

we

ﬁeld
structures
on

together
with
compatible

for

This

of
“Ap

may
be
thought
of
as
a
system
of
“local
linear
holomorphic
structures”
on
Etop
or
Xtop
.
Finally,
the
asserted
“functoriality”
is
with
respect
to
ﬁnite
étale
morphisms
of
Aut-holomorphic
orbispaces
arising
from
hyperbolic
orbicurves
over
C.
Proof.
The
validity
of
the
algorithm
asserted
in
Corollary
2.7
is
immediate
from
the
constructions
that
appear
in
the
statement
of
this
algorithm
[together
with
the
references
quoted
in
these
constructions].
Remark
2.7.1.
It
is
by
no
means
the
intention
of
the
author
to
assert
that
the
technique
applied
in
Corollary
2.7,
(b),
(c),
to
recover
the
“local
additive
structure”
via
elliptic
cuspidalization
is
the
unique
way
to
construct
this
local
additive
structure.
Indeed,
perhaps
the
most
direct
approach
to
the
problem
of
constructing
the
local
additive
structure
is
to
compactify
the
given
once-punctured
elliptic
curve
and
then
to
consider
the
group
structure
of
the
[connected
component
of
the
identity
of
the]
holomorphic
automorphism
group
of
the
resulting
elliptic
curve.
By
comparison
to
this
direct
approach,
however,
the
technique
of
elliptic
cuspidalization
has
the
virtue
of
being
compatible
with
the
“hyperbolic
structure”
of
the
hyperbolic
orbicurves
involved.
In
particular,
it
is
compatible
with
the
various
“hyperbolic
fundamental
groups”
of
these
orbicurves.
This
sort
of
compatibility
with
fundamental
groups
plays
an
essential
role
in
the
nonarchimedean
theory
[cf.,
e.g.,
the
theory
of
[Mzk18],
§1,
§2].
On
the
other
hand,
the
“direct
approach”
described
above
is
not
entirely
unrelated
to
the
approach
via
elliptic
cuspidalization
in
the
sense
that,
if
one
thinks
of
the
torsion
points
in
the
latter
approach
as
playing
an
analogous
role
to
the
role
played
by
the
“entire
compactiﬁed
elliptic
curve”
in
the
former
approach,
then
the
latter
approach
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
discretization
via
torsion
points
—
cf.
the
point
of
view
of
Hodge-Arakelov
theory,
as
discussed
in
[Mzk6],
[Mzk7]
—
of
the
former
approach.
Here,
we
note
that
the
density
of
torsion
points
in
the
archimedean
theory
of
the
elliptic
cuspidalization
is
reminiscent
of
the
density
of
NF-points
in
the
nonarchimedean
theory
of
the
Belyi
cuspidalization
[cf.
§1].
Remark
2.7.2.
In
light
of
the
role
played
by
the
technique
of
elliptic
cuspidalization
both
in
Corollary
2.7
and
in
the
theory
of
[Mzk18],
§1,
§2,
it
is
of
interest
to
compare
these
two
theories.
From
an
archimedean
point
of
view,
the
theory
of
[Mzk18]
may
be
roughly
summarized
as
follows:
One
begins
with
the
uniformization
∼
G

G/q
Z
→
E
TOPICS
IN
ABSOLUTE
ANABELIAN
GEOMETRY
III
61
of
an
elliptic
curve
E
over
C
by
a
copy
G
of
C×
.
Here,
the
“q-parameter”
of
E
may
be
thought
of
as
being
an
element
def
q
∈
H
=
G
⊗
Gal(G/E)
[where
we
recall
that
Gal(G/E)
∼
=
Z].
Then
one
thinks
of
the
theta
function
associated
to
E
as
a
function
Θ
:
G
→
H
[i.e.,
a
function
deﬁned
on
G
with
values
in
H].
From
this
point
of
view,
the
various
types
of
rigidity
considered
in
the
theory
of
[Mzk18]
may
be
understood
in
the
following
fashion:
(a)
Cyclotomic
rigidity
corresponds
to
the
portion
of
the
tautological
iso∼
morphism
H
→
G
⊗
Gal(G/E)
involving
the
maximal
compact
subgroups,
def
i.e.,
the
copies
of
S1
=
{z
∈
C×
|
|z|
=
1}
⊆
C×
.
(b)
Discrete
rigidity
corresponds
to
the
portion
of
the
tautological
isomor∼
phism
H
→
G⊗Gal(G/E)
involving
the
quotients
by
the
maximal
compact
def
subgroups,
i.e.,
the
copies
of
R>0
=
{z
∈
R
|
z
>
0}
∼
=
C×
/S1
.
(c)
Constant
rigidity
corresponds
to
considering
the
normalization
of
√
Θ
given
by
taking
the
values
of
Θ
at
the
points
of
G
corresponding
to
±
−1
to
be
±1.
In
particular,
the
“canonical
copy
of
C×
”
that
arises
from
(a),
(b)
—
i.e.,
H
—
is
related
to
the
“copies
of
C×
”
that
occur
as
the
“Ap
”
of
Corollary
2.7,
(e),
in
the
following
way:
Ap
is
given
by
the
linear
holomorphic
automorphisms
of
the
tangent
space
to
a
point
of
H.
That
is
to
say,
roughly
speaking,
Ap
(∼
=
C×
)
is
related
to
H
(∼
=
C×
)
by
the
operation
of
“taking
the
logarithm”,
followed
by
the
operation
of
“taking
Aut(−)”
[of
the
resulting
linearization].
Remark
2.7.3.
It
is
interesting
to
note
that
just
as
the
absolute
Galois
group
Gk
of
an
MLF
k
may
be
regarded
as
a
two-dimensional
object
with
one
rigid
and
one
non-rigid
dimension
[cf.
Remark
1.9.4],
the
topological
group
C×
is
also
a
two-dimensional
object
with
one
rigid
dimension
—
i.e.,
S1
=
{z
∈
C×
|
|z|
=
1}
⊆
C×
def
[a
topological
group
whose
automorphism
group
is
of
order
2]
—
and
one
non-rigid
dimension
—
i.e.,
def
R>0
=
{z
∈
R
|
z
>
0}
⊆
C×
[a
topological
group
that
is
isomorphic
to
R,
hence
has
automorphism
group
given
by
R×
—
i.e.,
a
“continuous
family
of
dilations”].
Moreover,
just
as,
in
the
context
of
Theorem
1.9,
Corollary
1.10,
considering
Gk
equipped
with
its
outer
action
on
ΔX
has
the
eﬀect
of
rendering
both
dimensions
of
Gk
rigid
[cf.
Remark
1.9.4],
considering
“C×
”
as
arising,
in
the
fashion
discussed
in
Corollary
2.7,
from
a
certain
Aut-holomorphic
orbispace
has
the
eﬀect
of
rigidifying
both
dimensions
of
C×
.
We
refer
to
Remark
2.7.4
below
for
more
on
this
analogy
between
the
(i)
outer
action
of
Gk
on
ΔX
62
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
and
the
notion
of
an
(ii)
Aut-holomorphic
orbispace
associated
to
a
hyperbolic
orbicurve.
Finally,
we
observe
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
problem
of
ﬁnding
an
algorithm
to
construct
the
base
ﬁeld
of
a
hyperbolic
orbicurve
from
(i),
(ii),
one
may
think
of
Theorem
1.9
and
Corollaries
1.10,
2.7
as
furnishing
solutions
to
various
versions
of
this
problem.
Remark
2.7.4.
The
usual
deﬁnition
of
a
“holomorphic
structure”
on
a
Riemann
surface
is
via
local
comparison
to
some
ﬁxed
model
of
the
topological
ﬁeld
C.
The
local
homeomorphisms
that
enable
this
comparison
are
related
to
one
another
by
homeomorphisms
of
open
neighborhoods
of
C
that
are
holomorphic.
On
the
other
hand,
this
deﬁnition
does
not
yield
any
absolute
description
—
i.e.,
a
description
that
depends
on
mathematical
structures
that
do
not
involve
explicit
use
of
models
—
of
what
precisely
is
meant
by
the
notion
of
a
“holomorphic
structure”.
Instead,
it
relies
on
relating/comparing
the
given
manifold
to
the
ﬁxed
model
of
C
—
an
approach
that
is
“model-explicit”.
By
contrast,
the
notion
of
a
topological
space
[i.e.,
consisting
of
the
datum
of
a
collection
of
subsets
that
are
to
be
regarded
as
“open”]
is
absolute,
or
“model-implicit”.
In
a
similar
vein,
the
approach
to
quasiconformal
or
conformal
structures
via
the
datum
of
a
collection
of
parallelograms,
rectangles,
or
squares
[cf.
Propositions
2.5,
2.6;
Remark
2.6.1;
the
theory
of
[Mzk14]]
is
“model-implicit”.
The
approach
to
“holomorphic
structures”
on
a
Riemann
surface
via
the
classical
notion
of
a
“conformal
structure”
[i.e.,
the
datum
of
various
orthogonal
pairs
of
tangent
vectors]
is,
so
to
speak,
“relatively
model-implicit”,
i.e.,
“model-implicit”
modulo
the
fact
that
it
depends
on
the
“model-explicit”
deﬁnition
of
the
notion
of
a
diﬀerential
manifold
—
which
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“local
linear
structure”
that
is
given
by
local
comparison
to
the
local
linear
structure
of
Euclidean
space.
From
this
point
of
view:
The
notions
of
an
“outer
action
of
Gk
on
ΔX
”
and
an
“Aut-holomorphic
orbispace”
[cf.
Remark
2.7.3,
(i),
(ii)]
have
the
virtue
of
being
“modelimplicit”
—
i.e.,
they
do
not
depend
on
any
sort
of
[local]
comparison
to
some
ﬁxed
reference
model.
In
this
context,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
all
of
the
examples
given
so
far
of
“model-implicit”
deﬁnitions
depend
on
data
consisting
either
of
subsets
[e.g.,
open
subsets
of
a
topological
space;
parallelograms,
rectangles,
or
squares
on
a
Riemann
surface]
or
endomorphisms
[e.g.,
the
automorphisms
that
appear
in
a
Galois
category;
the
automorphisms
that
appear
in
an
Aut-holomorphic
structure].
[Here,
in
passing,
we
note
that
the
appearance
of
“endomorphisms”
in
the
present
discussion
is
reminiscent
of
the
discussion
of
“hidden
endomorphisms”
in
the

Also,
we
observe
that
this

between

and
modelimplicit
deﬁnitions
is
strongly
reminiscent
of
the
distinction
between

and
mono-anabelian

Finally,
we
relate
the
archimedean
theory
of
the
present
§2
to
the
Galoistheoretic
theory
of
§1,
in
the
case
of
number
ﬁelds,
via
a
sort
of
archimedean
analogue
of
Corollary
1.10.
Corollary
2.8.
(Galois-theoretic
Reconstruction
of
Aut-holomorphic
Spaces)
Let
X,
k
⊆
k
⊇
k
NF
,
and
1
→
ΔX
→
ΠX
→
Gk
→
1
be
as
in
Theorem
1.9;
suppose
further
that
k
is
a
number
ﬁeld
[so
k
NF
=
k],
and
[for
simplicity
—
cf.
Remark
2.8.2
below]
that
X
is
a
curve.
Then
one
may
think
of
each
×
archimedean
prime
of
the
ﬁeld
k
NF
{0}
(∼
=
k
NF
)
constructed
in
Theorem
1.9,
×
(e),
as
a
topology
on
k
NF
{0}
satisfying
certain
properties.
Moreover,
for
each
such
archimedean
prime
v,
there
exists
a
functorial
“group-theoretic”
algorithm
for
reconstructing
the
Aut-holomorphic
space
Xv
associated
to
def
Xv
=
X
×k
kv
×
[where
we
write
kv
for
the
completion
of
k
NF
{0}
at
v]
from
the
topological
group
ΠX
;
this
algorithm
consists
of
the
following
steps:
(a)
Deﬁne
a
Cauchy
sequence
{xj
}j∈N
of
NF-points
[of
Xv
]
to
be
a
sequence
of
NF-points
xj
[i.e.,
conjugacy
classes
of
decomposition
groups
of
NF-points
in
ΠX
—
cf.
Theorem
1.9,
(a)]
such
that
there
exists
a
ﬁnite
set
of
NF-points
S
—
which
we
shall
refer
to
as
a
conductor
for
the
Cauchy
sequence
—
satisfying
the
following
two
conditions:
(i)
xj
∈
S
for
all
but
ﬁnitely
many
j
∈
N;
(ii)
for
every
NF-rational
function
f
on
Xk
as
in
Theorem
1.9,
(d),
whose
divisor
of
poles
avoids
S,
the
sequence
of
[non-inﬁnite,
for
all
but
ﬁnitely
many
j
—
cf.
(i)]
values
{f
(xj
)
∈
kv
}j∈N
forms
a
Cauchy
sequence
[in
the
usual
sense]
of
kv
.
Two
Cauchy
sequences
{xj
}j∈N
,
{yj
}j∈N
of
NF-points
which
admit
a
common
conductor
S
will
be
called
equivalent
if
for
every
NF-rational
function
f
on
Xk
as
in
Theorem
1.9,
(d),
whose
divisor
of
poles
avoids
S,
the
sequences
of
[non-inﬁnite,
for
all
but
ﬁnitely
many
j]
values
{f
(xj
)}j∈N
,
{f
(yj
)}j∈N
form
Cauchy
sequences
in
kv
that
converge
to
the
same
element
of
kv
.
For
U
⊆
kv
an
open
subset
and
f
an
NF-rational
function
on
Xk
as
in
Theorem
1.9,
(d),
we
obtain
a
set
N
(U,
f
)
of
Cauchy
sequences
of
NFpoints
by
considering
the
Cauchy
sequences
of
NF-points
{xj
}j∈N
such
that
f
(xj
)
[is
ﬁnite
and]
∈
U
,
for
all
j
∈
N.
Then
one
constructs
the
topological
space
Xtop
=
Xv
(kv
)
as
the
set
of
equivalence
classes
of
Cauchy
sequences
of
NF-points,
equipped
with
the
topology
deﬁned
by
the
sets
“N
(U,
f
)”.
(b)
Let
UX
⊆
Xtop
,
Uv
⊆
kv
be
connected
open
subsets
and
f
a
NFrational
function
on
Xk
as
in
Theorem
1.9,
(d),
such
that
the
function
deﬁned
by
f
on
UX
[i.e.,
by
taking
limits
of
Cauchy
sequences
of
∼
values
in
kv
—
cf.
(a)]
determines
a
homeomorphism
fU
:
UX
→
Uv
.
∼
Write
Authol
(Uv
)
for
the
group
of
self-homeomorphisms
Uv
→
Uv
(⊆
kv
),
which,
relative
to
the
topological
ﬁeld
structure
of
kv
,
can
locally
[on
64
SHINICHI

Uv
]
be
expressed
as
a
convergent
power
series
with
coeﬃcients
in
kv
;
AX
(UX
)
=
fU−1
◦
Authol
(Uv
)
◦
fU
⊆
Aut(UX
).
Then
one
constructs
the
Aut-holomorphic
structure
AX
on
Xtop
as
the
unique
[cf.
Corollary
2.3,
(ii)]
Aut-holomorphic
structure
that
extends
the
pre-Aut-holomorphic
structure
determined
by
the
groups
“AX
(UX
)”;
we
take
Xv
to
be
the
Autholomorphic
space
determined
by
the
objects
(Xtop
,
AX
).
def
Finally,
the
asserted
“functoriality”
is
with
respect
to
arbitrary
open
injective
homomorphisms
of
proﬁnite
groups
[i.e.,
of
“ΠX
”]
that
are
compatible
with
the
respective
choices
of
archimedean
valuations
[i.e.,
“v”].
Proof.
The
validity
of
the
algorithm
asserted
in
Corollary
2.8
is
immediate
from
the
constructions
that
appear
in
the
statement
of
this
algorithm
[together
with
the
references
quoted
in
these
constructions].
Remark
2.8.1.
One
veriﬁes
immediately
that
the
isomorphism
class
of
the
pair
(1
→
ΔX
→
ΠX
→
Gk
→
1,
v)
depends
only
on
the
restriction
of
v
to
the
subﬁeld
×
k
×
{0}
⊆
k
NF
{0}.
Remark
2.8.2.
One
veriﬁes
immediately
that
Corollary
2.8
[as
well
as
Corollary
2.9
below]
may
be
extended
to
the
case
where
X
is
a
hyperbolic
orbicurve
that
is
not
necessarily
a
curve
[so
Xv
will
be
an
Aut-holomorphic
orbispace].
Remark
2.8.3.
One
veriﬁes
immediately
that
any
elliptically
admissible
hyperbolic
orbicurve
deﬁned
over
a
number
ﬁeld
is
of
strictly
Belyi
type.
In
particular,
if
one
is
given
an
elliptically
admissible
hyperbolic
orbicurve
X
that
is
deﬁned
over
a
number
ﬁeld
k,
then
it
makes
sense
to
apply
Corollary
2.7
to
the
Aut-holomorphic
[orbi]spaces
constructed
in
Corollary
2.8.
This
compatibility
between
Corollaries
2.7,
2.8
[cf.
also
Corollary
2.9
below]
is
one
reason
why
it
is
of
interest
to
construct
the
local
additive
structures
as
in
Corollary
2.7,
(c),
directly
from
the
Aut-holomorphic
structure
as
opposed
to
via
the
“parallelogram-theoretic”
approach
of
Proposition
2.5,
2.6
[cf.
also
Remark
2.6.1],
which
is
more
suited
to
“strictly
archimedean
situations”
—
i.e.,
situations
in
which
one
is
not
concerned
with
regarding
Autholomorphic
orbispaces
as
arising
from
hyperbolic
orbicurves
over
number
ﬁelds.
Corollary
2.9.
(Global-Archimedean
Elliptically
Admissible
Compatibility)
In
the
notation
of
Corollary
2.8,
suppose
further
that
X
is
elliptically
admissible;
take
the
Aut-holomorphic
space
X
of
Corollary
2.7
to
be
the
Autholomorphic
space
determined
by
the
objects
(Xtop
,
AX
)
constructed
in
Corollary
2.8.
Then
one
may
construct,
in
a
functorially
algorithmic
fashion,
an
isomorphism
between
the
topological
ﬁeld
kv
of
Corollary
2.8
and
the
topological
ﬁelds
“Ap
{0}”
of
Corollary
2.7,
(e),
in
the
following
way:
(a)
Let
x
∈
Xv
(kv
)
be
an
NF-point.
The
local
additive
structures
on
Etop
[cf.
Corollary
2.7,
(c)]
determine
local
additive
structures
on
Xtop
;
let
v
be
an
element
of
a
suﬃciently
small
neighborhood
UX
⊆
Xtop
of
x
in
Xtop
TOPICS
IN

65
that
admits
such
a
local
additive
structure.
Then
for
each
NF-rational
function
f
that
vanishes
at
x,
the
assignment
(v
,
f
)
→
lim
n
·
f
(
n→∞
1
·x
v
)
∈
kv
n
[where
“·x
”
is
the
operation
arising
from
the
local
additive
structure
at
x]
depends
only
on
the
image
df
|x
∈
ωx
of
f
in
the
Zariski
cotangent
space
ωx
to
Xv
at
x
and,
moreover,
determines
a
topological
embedding
ιUX
,x
:
UX
→
Homkv
(ωx
,
kv
)
that
is
compatible
with
the
“local
additive
structures”
of
the
domain
and
codomain.
(b)
By
letting
the
neighborhoods
UX
of
a
ﬁxed
NF-point
x
vary,
the
resulting
ιUX
,x
determine
an
isomorphism
of
topological
ﬁelds
Ax

∼
{0}
→
kv
via
the
condition
of
compatibility
[with
respect
to
the
ιUX
,x
]
with
the
natural
actions
of
Ax
,
kv
,
respectively,
on
the
domain
and
codomain
of
ιUX
,x
.
Moreover,
as
x
varies,
these
isomorphisms
are
compatible
with
the
iso∼
morphisms
Ax1
{0}
→
Ax2
{0}
[where
x1
,
x2
∈
X(kv
)
are
NF-points]
of
Corollary
2.7,
(e).
Finally,
the
asserted
“functoriality”
is
to
be
understood
in
the
sense
described
in
Corollary
2.8.
Proof.
The
validity
of
the
algorithm
asserted
in
Corollary
2.9
is
immediate
from
the
constructions
that
appear
in
the

Section
3:
Nonarchimedean
Log-Frobenius
Compatibility
In
the
present
§3,
we
give
an
interpretation
of
the
nonarchimedean
local
portion
of
the
theory
of
§1
in
terms
of
a
certain
compatibility
with
the
“log-Frobenius
functor”
[in
essence,
a
version
of
the
usual
“logarithm”
at
the
various
nonarchimedean
primes
of
a
number
ﬁeld].
In
order
to
express
this
compatibility,
certain
abstract
category-theoretic
ideas
—
which
center
around
the
notions
of
observables,
telecores,
and
cores
—
are
introduced
[cf.
Deﬁnition
3.5].
These
notions
allow
one
to
express
the
log-Frobenius
compatibility
of
the
mono-anabelian
construction
algorithms
of
§1
[cf.
Corollary
3.6],
as
well
as
the
failure
of
log-Frobenius
compatibility
that
occurs
if
one
attempts
to
take
a
“bi-anabelian”
approach
to
the
situation
[cf.

3.7].

Finally,
we

write

also,
we

use
the

notation,
except
with

replaced
by

denote
the

Thus,
for

the

determines

[as

(iv)
Observe
that
[in
the
notation

the
ﬁeld

of

determines,
via
the
inverse
morphism
to
logk
,
a
structure
of
topological
ﬁeld
on
the
topological

k

Since
the
various
operations
applied
here
to
construct
this
ﬁeld
structure
on
k
∼
[such
as,
for
instance,
the
power
series
used
to
deﬁne
logk
]
are
clearly
intrinsically
deﬁned
[cf.
the
natural
functors
deﬁned
in

we
thus
obtain
that
the
construction
that
assigns

→
CTF
—
which
we
shall
refer
to
as
the
log-Frobenius

[cf.
Remark
3.6.2
below].
Since
logk
determines
a
functorial
isomorphism
between
the
ﬁelds

k
∼
,
it
follows

immediately
that
the
functor

is
isomorphic
to

By

is
an

a

Remark
3.1.1.
Observe
that
[in
the
notation
of
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(i)]
the
topology
on
the
ﬁeld
k,
the
groups
k
×
and
Ok×
,
or
the
monoid
Ok
is
completely
determined
by
the
ﬁeld,
group,
or
monoid
structures
of
these
objects.
Indeed,
the
topology
on
Ok×
is
precisely
the
proﬁnite
topology;
the
topologies
on
k,
k
×
,
and
Ok
are
determined
by
the
topology
on
the
subset
Ok×
⊆
Ok
⊆
k
×
⊆
k
[cf.
the
various
natural
functors
of
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(iii);
the
fact
that
Ok×
⊆
k
×
may
be
characterized
as
the
subgroup
of
elements
divisible
by
arbitrary
powers
of
some
prime
number].
Suppose
that
T
=
TS,
TS.
Then
note
that
one
may
apply
this
observation
to
the
various
subﬁelds,
subgroups,
or
submonoids
obtained
from
the
arithmetic
data
of
an
MLF-Galois
T-pair
by
taking
the
invariants
with
respect
to
some
open
subgroup
of
the
Galois
group.
Thus,
we
conclude
that
one
obtains
an
entirely
equivalent
theory
if
one
omits
the
speciﬁcation
of
the
topology,
as
well
as
of
the
“ind-”
structure
[i.e.,
one
works
with
the
inductive
limit
ﬁelds,
groups,
or
monoids,
as
opposed
to
the
inductive
systems
of
such
objects]
from
the
objects
of

considered
in

is
precisely
the
data

that
forms

construct
the
“model

Frobenioids”

Remark
3.1.2.
It
is
important
to
note
that,
by
deﬁnition,
the
algorithms
of
Corollary
1.10
form
an
essential
portion
of
each
object
of
the
category
Anab.
Put
another
way,
the
“software”
constituted
by
these
algorithms
is
not
just
executed
once,
leaving
behind
some
“output
data”
that
suﬃces
for
the
remainder
of
the
development
of
the
theory,
but
rather
executed
over
and
over
again
within
each
object
of

H
,
and,
moreover,
the
natural
transformations
that
constitute
H,
H
[cf.
the
data
of
(ii),
(b)]
are
compatible
[in
the
evident
sense]
with
the
natural
transformations
that
constitute
Φ
[cf.
the
data
(c)
in
the
above
deﬁnition];
in
this
situation,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
if
Φ
is
compatible
with
H,
H
,
then
so
is
∼
any
equivalence
Ψ
:
D
→
D
that
is
isomorphic
to
Φ.
We
shall
say
that
D
is
vertexrigid
(respectively,
edge-rigid)
if,
for
every
vertex
v
(respectively,
edge
e)
of
ΓD
,
the
TOPICS

category
Dv
(respectively,
the
functor
De
)
is
id-rigid
(respectively,
rigid)
[cf.
§0].
If
D
is
vertex-rigid
and
edge-rigid,
then
we
shall
say
that
D
is
totally
rigid.
Thus,
∼
if
D
is
edge-rigid,
then
any
equivalence
Φ
:
D
→
D
is
completely
determined
by
ΦΓ
and
the
{Φv
}
[i.e.,
the
data
(a),
(b)
in
the
above
deﬁnition].
In
a
similar
vein,
∼
if
D
is
vertex-rigid,
then
any
two
isomorphic
equivalences
Φ,
Ψ
:
D
→
D
admit
a
∼
unique
[2-]isomorphism
Φ
→
Ψ.
In
particular,
if
D
is
vertex-rigid,
then
it
is
natural
to
speak
of
the
automorphism
group
Aut(D)
of
D,
i.e.,
the
group
determined
by
the
isomorphism
classes
of
self-equivalences
of
D.
(vi)
Let
D
=
(ΓD
,
{Dv
},
{De
})
be
a
diagram
of
categories;

a
nexus
of
ΓD
[cf.
§0];
D≤
,
D≥
the
subdiagrams
of
categories
determined,
respectively,
by
the
preand
post-nexus
portions
of
ΓD
[cf.
§0].
Then
we
shall
say
that
D
is
totally
-rigid
if
the
pre-nexus
portion
D≤
is
totally
rigid.
Let
us
suppose
that
D
is
totally
-rigid.
Write
Aut
(D≤
)
⊆
Aut(D≤
)
for
the
subgroup
of
isomorphism
classes
of
self-equivalences
of
D≤
that
preserve

and
induce
a
self-equivalence
of
D
that
is
isomorphic
to
the
identity
self∼
equivalence.
Let
Φ≤
:
D≤
→
D≤
be
a
self-equivalence
whose
isomorphism
class
∼
[Φ≤
]
∈
Aut
(D≤
).
Then
Φ≤
extends
naturally
to
an
equivalence
Φ
:
D
→
D
which
is
the
identity
on
ΓD≥
and
which
associates
to
each
vertex
v
=

of
ΓD≥
the
identity
self-equivalence
of
Dv
.
[Here,
we
observe
that
the
isomorphism
of
functors
of
(v),
(c),
is
naturally
determined
by
the
isomorphism
of
(Φ≤
)
with
the
identity
self-equivalence
of
D
.]
Moreover,
this
assignment
Φ≤
→
Φ
clearly
maps
isomorphic
equivalences
to
isomorphic
equivalences
and
is
compatible
with
composition
of
equivalences.
In
particular,
this
assignment
yields
a
natural
“action”
of
the
group
Aut
(D≤
)
on
D.
We
shall
refer
to
the
resulting
selfequivalences
of
D
as
nexus
self-equivalences
of
D
[relative
to
the
nexus
]
and
the
resulting
classes
of
self-equivalences
of
D
[i.e.,
arising
from
isomorphism
classes
of
“Φ≤
”]
as
nexus-classes
of
self-equivalences
of
D
[relative
to
the
nexus
].
Remark
3.5.1.
If
one
just
works
with
diagrams
of
categories
without
considering
any
observables,
then
it
is
diﬃcult
to
understand
the
“global
structure”
of
the
diagram
since
[by
deﬁnition!]
it
does
not
make
sense
to
speak
of
the
relationship
between
objects
that
belong
to
diﬀerent
categories
[e.g.,
at
distinct
vertices
of
the
diagram].
Thus:
The
notion
of
an
observable
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“partial
projection
of
the
dynamics
of
a
diagram
of
categories”
onto
a
single
category,
within
which
it
makes
sense
to
compare
objects
that
arise
from
distinct
categories
at
distinct
vertices
of
the
diagram.
Moreover:
A
core
on
a
diagram
of
categories
may
be
thought
of
as
an
extraction
of
a
certain
portion
of
the
data
of
the
objects
at
the
various
categories
in
the
78
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
diagram
that
is
invariant
with
respect
to
the
“dynamics”
arising
from
the
application
of
the
various
functors
in
the
diagram.
Put
another
way,
one
may
think
of
a
core
as
a
sort
of
“constant
portion”
of
the
diagram
that
lies,
in
a
consistent
fashion,
“under
the
entire
diagram”
[cf.
the
use
of
the
term
“core”
in
the
theory
of
[Mzk11],
§2].
Then:
A
telecore
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
partial
section
—
i.e.,
given
by
the
telecore
edges
—
of
the
“structure
morphisms
to
the
core”
which
does
not
disturb
the
coricity
[i.e.,
the
property
of
being
a
core]
of
the
original
core.
Moreover,
although,
in
the
deﬁnition
of
a
telecore,
we
do
not
assume
the
existence
of
families
of
homotopies
that
guarantee
the
compatibility
of
applying
composites
of
functors
by
traveling
along
arbitrary
co-verticial
pairs
of
paths
emanating
from
the
core
vertex,
any
failure
of
such
a
compatibility
may
always
be
eliminated
—
in
a
fashion
reminiscent
of
a
“telescoping
sum”
—
by
projecting
back
down
to
the
core
vertex
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
3.6.1,
(ii),
(c),
below].
Put
another
way,
one
may
think
of
a
telecore
as
a
device
that
satisﬁes
a
sort
of
“time
lag
compatibility”,
i.e.,
as
a
device
whose
“compatibility
apparatus”
does
not
go
into
operation
immediately,
but
only
after
a
certain
“time
lag”
[arising
from
the
necessity
to
travel
back
down
to
the
core
vertex].
Also,
for
more
on
the
meaning
of
cores
and
telecores,
we
refer
to
Remark
3.6.5
below.
The
terminology
of
Deﬁnition
3.5

it
possible
to
formulate
the

extend

[cf.
the

of

applied
in
Deﬁnition
3.5,
(vi)]
to
the

of
categories
[cf.
Deﬁnition
3.5,

that
constitutes
the

of

in
a
fashion
that
is
compatible
with
both
the

of

that
constitutes
this
telecore
structure
[cf.
Deﬁnition
3.5,
(iv),

and
the
contact
structure
HAn
of
(ii).
Proof.
In
the
following,
if
φ
is
a
functor
appearing
in
D,
then
let
us
write
[φ]
for
the
path
on
the
underlying
oriented
graph
ΓD
of
D
determined
by
the
edge
corresponding
to
φ
[cf.
§0].
Now
assertion
(i)
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions
and
the
fact
that
the
algorithms
of
Corollary
1.10
are
“group-theoretic”
in
the
sense
that
they
are
expressed
in
language
that
depends
only
on
the
proﬁnite
group
given
as
“input
data”.
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
The
portion
of
assertion
(ii)
concerning
φAn
and
TAn
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions
and
the
“group-theoretic”
algorithms
of
Corollary
1.10
[cf.
also
Proposition
3.2,
(ii),
(iii)].
Thus,
it
suﬃces
to
show
the
existence
of
a
contact
structure
HAn
as
described.
To
this
end,
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
the
isomorphism
of
log
with
the
identity
functor
[cf.
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(iv);
Proposition
3.2,
(v)]
is
compatible
[in
the
evident
sense]
with
the
natural
tranforma−1
−1
,
η
,
η
}∈L,∈L†
.
On
the
other
hand,
this
compatibility
implies
tions
{η
,
η
that
one
may,
in
eﬀect,
“contract”
D≤2
down
to
a
single
vertex
[equipped
with
the
TOPICS
IN
ABSOLUTE
ANABELIAN
GEOMETRY

81
category
X
]
and
the
various
paths
from

to
Anab
down
to
a
single
edge
—
i.e.,
that,
up
to
redundancies,
one
is,
in
eﬀect,
dealing
with
a
diagram
of
categories
with
two
vertices
“X
”
and
“Anab”
joined
by
two
[oriented]
edges
φAn
,
πAn
.
Now
the
existence
of
a
family
of
homotopies
that
contains
the
collection
of
natural
transfor−1
}∈L,∈L†
follows
immediately.
This
completes
the
proof
of
mations
{η
,
η
,
η
assertion
(ii).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
Write
Elog
for
the
set
of
ordered
pairs
of
paths
on
ΓD≤3
[i.e.,
the
underlying
oriented
graph
of
D≤3
]
consisting
of
pairs
of
paths
of
the
following
three
types:
(1)
([λ×
]
◦
[id
]
◦
[log]
◦
[γ],
[λ×pf
]
◦
[id+1
]
◦
[γ]),
where
[γ]
is
a
path
on
D≤3
whose
terminal
vertex
lies
in
the
ﬁrst
row
of
D≤3
;
(2)
([λ×
]
◦
[γ],
[λ×pf
]
◦
[γ]),
where
[γ]
is
a
path
on
D≤3
whose
terminal
vertex
lies
in
the
second
row
of
D≤3
;
(3)
([γ],
[γ]),
where
[γ]
is
a
path
on
D≤3
whose
terminal
vertex
lies
in
the
third
row
of
D≤3
.
Then
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
Elog
satisﬁes
the
conditions
(a),
(b),
(c),
(d),
(e)
given
in
§0
for
a
saturated
set.
Moreover,
the
natural
transformation(s)
ιlog,
(respectively,
ι×
)
determine(s)
the
homotopies
for
pairs
of
paths
of
type
(1)
(respectively,
(2)).
Thus,
we
obtain
an
observable
Slog
,
as
desired.
Moreover,
it
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions
—
i.e.,
in
essence,
because
the
various
Galois
groups
that
appear
remain
“undisturbed”
by
the
various
manipulations
involving
arithmetic
data
that
arise
from
“ιlog,
”,
“ι×
”
—
that
this
family
of
homotopies
is
compatible
with
the
families
of
homotopies
that
constitute
the
core
and
telecore
structures
of
(i),
(ii).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iv).
Suppose
that
D≤2
admits
a
structure
of
core
on
D≤1
in
a
fashion
that
is
compatible
with
the
observable
Slog
of

Then
this
core
structure
determines,
for

∈
L,
a
homotopy
ζ0
for
the
pair
of
paths
([id+1
],
[id
]
◦
[log]);
thus,
by
composing
the
result
ζ0
of
applying
λ×
to
ζ0
with
the
homotopy
ζ1
associated
[via
Slog
]
to
the
pair
of
paths
([λ×
]◦[id
]◦[log],
[λ×pf
]◦
[id+1
])
[of
type
(1)],
we
obtain
a
natural
transformation
ζ1
=
ζ1
◦
ζ0
:
λ×
◦
id+1
→
λ×pf
◦
id+1
—
which,
in
order
for
the
desired
compatibility
to
hold,
must
coincide
with
the
homotopy
ζ2
associated
[via
Slog
]
to
the
pair
of
paths
([λ×
]◦[id+1
],
[λ×pf
]◦[id+1
])
[of
type
(2)].
On
the
other
hand,
by
writing
out
explicitly
the
meaning
of
such
an
equality
ζ1
=
ζ2
,
we
conclude
that
we
obtain
a
contradiction
to
Lemma
3.4.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
ﬁrst
incompatibility
of
assertion
(iv).
The
proof
of
the
second
incompatibility
of
assertion
(iv)
is
entirely
similar.
That
is
to
say,
if
we
compose
on
the
right
with
[φ+1
]
the
various
paths
that
appeared
in
the
proof
of
the
ﬁrst
incompatibility,
then
in
order
to
apply
the
argument
applied
in
the
proof
of
the
ﬁrst
incompatibility,
it
suﬃces
to
relate
the
paths
[id+1

[φ+1

[id

◦
[log]
◦
[φ+1

(ii)
In
words,
the
content
of
Corollary
3.6
may
be
summarized
as
follows
[cf.
the
“intuitive
diagram”
of
(i)]:
(a)
The
Galois
groups
that
act
on
the
various
objects
under
consideration
are
compatible
with
all
of
the
operations
involved
—
in
particular,
the
operations
constituted
by
the
functors
log,
κAn
,
φAn
and
the
various
related
families
of
homotopies
—
cf.
the
coricity
asserted
in
Corollary
3.6,
(i).
(b)
By
contrast,
the
operation
constituted
by
the
log-Frobenius
functor
[as
“observed”
via
the
observable
Slog
]
is
not
compatible
with
the
ﬁeld
structure
of
the
ﬁelds
[i.e.,
“k”]
involved
[cf.
Corollary
3.6,
(iv)].
(c)
As
a
consequence
of
(a),
the
“group-theoretic
reconstruction”
of
the
base
ﬁeld
via
Corollary
1.10
is
compatible
with
all
of
the
operations
involved,
except
“momentarily”
when
log
acts
on
the
output
of
φAn
—
an
operation
which
“temporarily
obliterates”
the
ﬁeld
structure
of
this
output,
although
this
ﬁeld
structure
may
be
recovered
by
projecting
back
down
to
E
[cf.
(a)]
and
applying
κAn
.
This
sort
of
“conditional
compatibility”
—
i.e.,
up
to
a
“brief
temporary
exception”
—
is
expressed
in
the
telecoricity
asserted
in
Corollary
3.6,
(ii).
In
particular,
if
one
thinks
of
the
various
operations
involved
as
being
“software”
[cf.
Remark
1.9.8],
then
the
projection
to
E
—
i.e.,
the
operation
of
looking
at
the
Galois
group
—
is
compatible
with
simultaneous
execution
of
all
the
“software”
[in
particular,
including
log!]
under
consideration;
the
“group-theoreticity”
of
the
algorithms
of
Corollary
1.10
implies
that
Anab,
κAn
satisfy
a
similar
“compatibility
with
simultaneous
execution
of
all
software”
[cf.
Remark
3.1.2]
property.
Remark
3.6.2.
(i)
The
reasoning
that
lies
behind
the
name
“log-Frobenius
functor”
may
be
understood
as
follows.
At
a
very
naive
level,
the
natural
logarithm
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“raising
to
the
-th
power”
[where

→
0
is
some
indeﬁnite
positive
inﬁnitesimal]
—
i.e.,
“”
plays
the
role
in
characteristic
[
→]0
of
“p”
in
characteristic
p
>
0.
More
generally,
the
logarithm
frequently
appears
in
the
context
of
Frobenius
actions,
in
particular
in
discussions
involving
canonical
coordinates,
such
as
in
[Mzk1],
Chapter
III,
§1.
(ii)
In
general,
Frobenius
morphisms
may
be
thought
of
as
“compression
morphisms”.
For
instance,
this
phenomenon
may
be
seen
in
the
most
basic
example
of
a
Frobenius
morphism
in
characteristic
p
>
0,
i.e.,
the
morphism
t
→
tp
on
Fp
[t].
Put
another
way,
the
“compression”
operation
inherent
in
a
Frobenius
morphism
may
be
thought
of
as
an
approximation
of
some
sort
of
“absolute
constant
object”
[such
as
Fp
].
In
the
context
of
the
log-Frobenius
functor,
this
sort
of
compression
phenomenon
may
be
seen
in
the
pre-log-shells
deﬁned
in
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(iv),
which
will
play
a
key
role
in
the
theory
of
§5
below.
84
SHINICHI

(iii)
Whereas
the
log-Frobenius
functor
obliterates
the
ﬁeld
[or
ring]
structure
[cf.
Remark
3.6.1,
(ii),
(b)]
of
the
ﬁelds
involved,
the
usual
Frobenius
morphism
in
positive
characteristic
is
compatible
with
the
ring
structure
of
the
rings
involved.
On
the
other
hand,
unlike
generically
smooth
morphisms,
the
Frobenius
morphism
in
positive
characteristic
has
the
eﬀect
of
“obliterating
the
diﬀerentials”
of
the
schemes
involved.
Remark
3.6.3.
The
diagram
D
of
Corollary
3.6
—
cf.,
especially,
the
ﬁrst
two
rows
D≤2
and
the
various
natural
actions
of
Z
discussed
in
Corollary
3.6,
(v)
—
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
combinatorial
version
of
Gm
—
cf.
the
point
of
view
of
Remark
1.9.7.
Remark
3.6.4.
One
veriﬁes
immediately
that
one
may
give
a
tempered
version
of
Propositions
3.2,
3.3;
Corollary
3.6
[cf.
Remarks
1.9.1,
1.10.2].
Remark
3.6.5.
The
notions
of
“core”
and
“telecore”
are
reminiscent
of
certain
aspects
of
“Hensel’s
lemma”
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk21],
Lemma
2.1].
That
is
to
say,
if
one
compares
the
successive
approximation
operation
applied
in
the
proof
of
Hensel’s
lemma
[cf.,
e.g.,
the
proof
of
[Mzk21],
Lemma
2.1]
to
the
various
operations
[in
the
form
of
functors]
that
appear
in
a
diagram
of
categories,
then
one
is
led
to
the
following
analogy:
cores
←→
sets
of
solutions
of
“étale”,
i.e.,
“slope
zero”
equations
telecores
←→
sets
of
solutions
of
“positive
slope”
equations
—
i.e.,
where
one
thinks
of
applications
of
Hensel’s
lemma
in
the
context
of
mixed
characteristic,
so
the
property
of
being
“étale
in
characteristic
p
>
0”
may
be
regarded
as
corresponding
to
“slope
zero”.
That
is
to
say,
the
“étale
case”
of
Hensel’s
lemma
is
the
easiest
to
understand.
In
this
“étale
case”,
the
invertibility
of
the
Jacobian
matrix
involved
implies
that
when
one
executes
each
successive
approximation
operation,
the
set
of
solutions
lifts
uniquely,
i.e.,
“transports
isomorphically”
through
the
operation.
This
sort
of
“isomorphic
transport”
is
reminiscent
of
the
deﬁnition
of
a
core
on
a
diagram
of
categories.
On
the
other
hand,
the
“positive
slope
case”
of
Hensel’s
lemma
is
a
bit
more
complicated
[cf.,
e.g.,
the
proof
of
[Mzk21],
Lemma
2.1].
That
is
to
say,
although
the
set
of
solutions
does
not
quite
“transport
isomorphically”
in
the
simplest
most
transparent
fashion,
the
fact
that
the
Jacobian
matrix
involved
is
invertible
up
to
a
factor
of
p
implies
that
the
set
of
solutions
“essentially
transports
isomorphically,
up
to
a
brief
temporary
lag”
—
cf.
the
“brief
temporary
exception”
of
Remark
3.6.1,
(ii),
(c).
Put
another
way,
if
one
thinks
in
terms
of
connections
on
bases
on
which
p
is
nilpotent,
in
which
case
formal
integration
takes
the
place
of
the
“successive
approximation
operation”
of
Hensel’s
lemma,
then
one
has
the
following
analogy:
cores
←→
vanishing
pn
-curvature
telecores
←→
nilpotent
pn
-curvature
[where
we
refer
to
[Mzk4],
Chapter
II,
§2;
[Mzk7],
§2.4,
for
more
on
“pn
-curvature”]
—

3.7.2

Remark
3.6.6.
(i)
In
the
context
of
the
analogy
between
telecores
and
“positive
slope
situations”
discussed
in
Remark
3.6.5,
one
question
that
may
occur
to
some
readers
is
the
following:
What
are
the
values
of
the
positive
slopes
implicitly
involved
in
a
telecore?
At
the
time
of
writing,
it
appears
to
the
author
that,
relative
to
this
analogy,
one
should
regard
telecores
as
containing
“all
positive
slopes”,
or,
alternatively,
“positive
slopes
of
an
indeterminate
nature”,
which
one
may
think
of
as
corresponding
to
the
lengths
of
the
various
paths
emanating
from
the
core
vertex
that
one
may
travel
along
before
descending
back
down
to
the
core
[cf.
Remark
3.5.1].
Indeed,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
analogy
[discussed
in
Remark
3.7.2
below]
with
the
uniformizing
MF
∇
-objects
constructed
in
[Mzk1],
[Mzk4],
this
is
natural,
since
uniformizing
MF
∇
-objects
also
involve,
in
eﬀect,
“all
positive
slopes”.
Moreover,
since
telecores
are
of
an
“abstract,
combinatorial
nature”
[cf.
Remark
1.9.7]
—
i.e.,
not
of
a
“linear,
module-theoretic
nature”,
as
is
the
case
with
MF
∇
-objects
—
it
seems
somewhat
natural
that
this
“combinatorial
non-linearity”
should
interfere
with
any
attempts
to
“separate
out
the
various
distinct
positive
slopes”,
via,
for
instance,
a
“linear
ﬁltration”,
as
is
often
possible
in
the
case
of
MF
∇
-objects.
(ii)
From
the
point
of
view
of
the
analogy
with
[uniformizing]
MF
∇
-objects,
one
has
the
following
[rough]
correspondence:
slope
zero
←→
Frobenius
“”
(an
isomorphism)
positive
slope
←→
Frobenius
“”
pn
·
(an
isomorphism)
[where
“”
is
to
be
understood
as
shorthand
for
the
phrase
“acts
via”;
n
is
a
positive
integer].
Perhaps
the
most
fundamental
example
in
the
p-adic
theory
of
such
a
[uniformizing]
MF
∇
-object
arises
from
the
p-adic
Galois
representation
obtained
by
extracting
p-power
roots
of
the
standard
unit
U
on
the
multiplicative
group
Gm
over
Zp
,
in
which
case
the
“positive
slope”
involved
corresponds
to
the
action
dlog(U
)
=
dU/U
→
p
·
dlog(U
)
induced
by
the
Frobenius
morphism
U
→
U
p
.
In
the
situation
of
Corollary
3.6,
an
analogue
of
this
sort
of
correspondence
may
be
seen
in
the
“temporary
failure
of
coricity”
[cf.
Remark
3.6.1,
(ii),
(c);
the
failure
of
coricity
documented
in
Corollary
3.6,
(iv)]
of
the
“mono-anabelian
telecore”
of
Corollary
3.6,
(ii).
That
is
to
say,
mutiplication
by
a
positive
power
of
p
corresponds
precisely
to
this
“temporary
failure
of
coricity”,
a
failure
that
is
remedied
[where
the
“remedy”
corresponds
to
the
isomorphism
that
appears
by
“pealing
oﬀ
”
an
appropriate
power
of
p]
by
projecting
back
down
to
Anab,
an
operation
which
[in
light
of
the
“group-theoretic
nature”
of
the
algorithms
applied
in
κAn
]
induces
an
isomorphism
of,
for
instance,
the
base-ﬁeld
reconstructed
after
the
application
of
log
with
the
base-ﬁeld
that
was
reconstructed
prior
to
the
application
of
log.
Remark
3.6.7.
Note
that
in
the
situation
of
Corollary
3.6
[cf.
also
the
terminology
introduced
in
Deﬁnition
3.5],
although
we
have
formulated
things
in
the
86
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
language
of
categories
and
functors,
in
fact,
the
mathematical
constructs
in
which
we
are
ultimately
interested
have
much
more
elaborate
structures
than
categories
and
functors.
That
is
to
say:
In
fact,
what
we
are
really
interested
in
is
not
so
much
“categories”
and
“functors”,
but
rather
“types
of
data”
and
“operations”
[i.e.,
algorithms!]
that
convert
some
“input
type
of
data”
into
some
“output
type
of
data”.
One
aspect
of
this
state
of
aﬀairs
may
be
seen
in
the
fact
that
the
crucial
functors
log,
κAn
of
Corollary
3.6
are
equivalences
of
categories
[which,
moreover,
are,
in
certain
cases,
isomorphic
to
the
identity
functor!
—
cf.
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(iv),
(vi)]
—
i.e.,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
purely
category-theoretic
structure
[cf.,
e.g.,
the
point
of
view
of
[Mzk14],
[Mzk16],
[Mzk17]!]
of
“X
”,
“E”,
or
“Anab”,
these
functors
are
“not
doing
anything”.
On
the
other
hand,
from
the
point
of
view
of
“types
of
data”
and
“operations”
on
these
“types
of
data”
[cf.
Remark
3.6.1],
the
operations
constituted
by
the
functors
log,
κAn
are
highly
nontrivial.
To
some
extent,
this
state
of
aﬀairs
may
be
remedied
by
working
with
appropriate
observables
[i.e.,
which
serve
to
project
the
operations
constituted
by
functors
between
diﬀerent
categories
down
into
arrows
in
a
single
category
—
cf.
Remark
3.5.1],
as
in
Corollary
3.6,
(iii),
(iv).
Nevertheless,
the
use
of
observables
does
not
constitute
a
fundamental
solution
to
the
issue
raised
above.
It
is
the
hope
of
the
author
to
remedy
this
state
of
aﬀairs
in
a
more
deﬁnitive
fashion
in
a
future
paper
by
introducing
appropriate
“enhancements”
to
the
usual
theory
of
categories
and
functors.
To
understand
what
is
gained
in
Corollary
3.6
by
the
mono-anabelian
theory
of
§1,
it
is
useful
to
consider
the
following
“bi-anabelian

of
Corollary
3.6.

Proof.
The
proofs
of
the
various
assertions
of
the
present
Corollary
3.7
are
entirely
similar
to
the
proofs
of
the
corresponding
assertions
of
Corollary
3.6.
Remark
3.7.1.
In
some
sense,
the
purpose
of
Corollary
3.7
is
to
examine
what
happens
if
the
mono-anabelian
theory
of
§1
is
not
available,
i.e.,
if
one
is
in
a
situation
in
which
one
may
only
apply
the
bi-anabelian
version
of
this
theory.
This
is
the
main
reason
for
our
assumption
that
“T
=
TF”
in
Corollary
3.7
—
that
is
TOPICS
IN

ANABELIAN
GEOMETRY

89
to
say,
when
T
=
TM,
one
is
obliged
to
apply
Proposition
3.2,
(v),
a
result
whose
proof
requires
one
to
invoke
the
mono-anabelian
theory
of
§1.
Remark
3.7.2.
The
“Frobenius-theoretic”
point
of
view
of
Remarks
3.6.2,
3.6.5,
3.6.6
motivates
the
following
observation:
The
situation
under
consideration
in
Corollaries
3.6,
3.7
is
structurally
reminiscent
of
the
situation
encountered
in
the
p-adic
crystalline
theory,
for
instance,
when
one
considers
the
MF
∇
-objects
of
[Falt].
That
is
to
say,
the
core
E
plays
the
role
of
the
“absolute
constants”,
given,
for
instance,
in
the
p-adic
theory
by
[absolutely]
unramiﬁed
extensions
of
Zp
.
The
isomorphism
∼
bi
θbi
:
prbi
1
→
pr2
bi
[cf.
Corollary
3.7,
(ii)]
between
the
two
projection
functors
prbi
1
,
pr2
:
X
×E
X
→
X
is
formally
reminiscent
of
the
notion
of
a(n)
[integrable]
connection
in
the
crystalline
theory.
The
diagonal
functor
δX
:
X
→
X
×
E
X
[cf.
Corollary
3.7,
(ii)]
is
formally
reminiscent
of
the
diagonal
embedding
into
the
divided
power
envelope
of
the
product
of
a
scheme
with
itself
in
the
crystalline
theory.
Moreover,
since,
in
the
crystalline
theory,
this
divided
power
envelope
may
itself
be
regarded
as
a
crystal,
the
[various
divided
powers
of
the
ideal
deﬁning
the]
diagonal
embedding
may
then
be
regarded
as
a
sort
of
Hodge
ﬁltration
on
this
crystal.
That
is
to
say,
the
telecore
structure
of
Corollary
3.7,
(ii),
may
be
regarded
as
corresponding
to
the
Hodge
ﬁltration,
or,
for
instance,
in
the
context
of
the
theory
of
indigenous
bundles
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk1],
[Mzk4]],
to
the
Hodge
section.
Thus,
from
this
point
of
view,
the
second
incompatibility
of
assertion
(iv)
of
Corollaries
3.6,
3.7,
is
reminiscent
of
the
fact
that
[in
general]
the
Frobenius
action
on
the
crystal
underlying
an
MF
∇
-object
fails
to
preserve
the
Hodge
ﬁltration.
For
instance,
in
the
case
of
indigenous
bundles,
this
failure
to
preserve
the
Hodge
section
may
be
regarded
as
a
consequence
of
the
isomorphicity
of
the
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
associated
to
the
Hodge
section.
On
the
other
hand,
the
log-Frobenius-compatibility
of
the
mono-anabelian
models
discussed
in
Corollary
3.6
may
be
regarded
as
corresponding
to
canonical
Frobenius
actions
on
the
crystals
constituted
by
the
divided
power
envelopes
discussed
above
—
cf.
the
uniformizing
MF
∇
-objects
constructed
in
[Mzk1],
[Mzk4].
Moreover,
the
compatibility
of
the
coricity
of
E,
Anab
with
the
telecore
and
contact
structures
of
Corollary
3.6,
(ii),
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
“logFrobenius
observable”
Slog
of
Corollary
3.6,
(iii),
on
the
other
hand,
is
reminiscent
of
the
construction
of
the
Galois
representation
associated
to
an
MF
∇
-object
by
considering
the
submodule
that
lies
in
the
0-th
step
of
the
Hodge
ﬁltration
and,
moreover,
is
ﬁxed
by
the
action
of
Frobenius
[cf.
Remark
3.7.3,
(ii),
below].
Thus,
in
summary,
we
have
the
following
“dictionary”:
the
coricity
of
E
←→
absolutely
unramiﬁed
constants
bi-anabelian
isomorphism
of
projection

←→

Remark
3.7.3.
The
signiﬁcance
of
Corollary
3.7
in
the
context
of
our
discussion
of
the
mono-anabelian
versus
the
bi-anabelian
approach
to
anabelian
geometry
[cf.
Remark
1.9.8]
may
be
understood
as
follows.
(i)
We
begin
by
considering
the
conditions
that
we
wish
to
impose
on
the
framework
in
which
we
are
to
work.
First
of
all,
we
wish
to
have
some
sort
of
ﬁxed
reference
model
of
“X
”.
The
fact
that
this
model
is
to
be
ﬁxed
throughout
the
discussion
then
translates
into
the
requirement
that
this
copy
of
X
be
a
core,
relative
to
the
various
“operations”
performed
during
the
discussion.
On
the
other
hand,
one
does
not
wish
for
this
model
to
remain
“completely
unrelated
to
the
operations
of
interest”,
but
rather
that
it
may
be
related,
or
compared,
to
the
various
copies
of
this
model
that
appear
as
one
executes
the
operations
of
interest.
In
our
situation,
we
wish
to
be
able
to
relate
the
“ﬁxed
reference
model”
to
the
copies
of
this
model
—
i.e.,
“log-subject
copies”
—
that
are
subject
to
the
log-Frobenius
operation
[i.e.,
functor
—
cf.
Remark
3.6.7].
Moreover,
since
the
log-Frobenius
functor
is
isomorphic
to
the
identity
functor
[cf.
Proposition
3.2,
(v)],
hence
may
only
be
“properly
understood”
in
the
context
of
the
natural
transformations
“ι×
”
and
“ιlog
”,
we
wish
for
everything
that
we
do
to
be
compatible
with
the
operation
of
“making
an
observation”
via
these
natural
transformations.
Thus,
in
summary,
the
main
conditions
that
we
wish
to
impose
on
the
framework
in
which
we
are
to
work
are
the
following:
(a)
coricity
of
the
model;
(b)
comparability
of
the
model
to
log-subject
copies
of
the
model;
(c)
consistent
observability
of
the
various
operations
executed
[especially
log].
In
the
context
of
the
various
assertions
of
Corollaries
3.6,
3.7,
these
three
aspects
correspond
as
follows:
(a)
←→
the
coricity
of
(i),
the
“coricity
portion”
of
the
telecore
structure
of
(ii),
(b)
←→
the
telecore
and
contact
structures/families
of
homotopies
of
(ii),
(c)
←→
the
“log-observable”
of
(iii).
[Here,
we
refer
to
the
content
of
Deﬁnition
3.5,
(iv),
(b),
as
the
“coricity
portion”
of
a
telecore
structure.]
In
the
case
of
Corollary
3.7,
the
“ﬁxed
reference
model”
is
realized
by
applying
a
“category-theoretic
base-change”
(−)
×E
X
,
as
in
Corollary
3.7,
i.e.,
the
copy
of
“X
”
used
to
eﬀect
this
base-change
serves
as
the
“ﬁxed
reference
model”;
in
the
case
of
Corollary
3.6,
the
“ﬁxed
reference
model”
is
given
by
“Anab”
[i.e.,
especially,
the
second
piece
of
parenthesized
data
“(−,
−)”
in
the
deﬁnition
of
Anab
—
cf.
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(vi)].
Also,
we
observe
that
the
second
incompatibility
of
TOPICS
IN
ABSOLUTE
ANABELIAN
GEOMETRY
III
91
assertion
(iv)
of
Corollaries
3.6,
3.7
asserts,
in
eﬀect,
that
neither
of
the
approaches
of
these
two
corollaries
succeeds
in
simultaneously
realizing
conditions
(a),
(b),
(c),
in
the
strict
sense.
(ii)
Let
us
take
a
closer
look
at
the
mono-anabelian
approach
of
Corollary
3.6
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
discussion
of
(i).
From
the
point
of
view
of
“operations
performed”,
this
approach
may
be
summarized
as
follows:
One
starts

applies
the

the

this

obliterates
the

[indeed,
it
obliterates
both
the
additive
and
multiplicative

of
the
arithmetic
data
involved,
hence
leaving
behind,
as
an
invariant
of
log,
only
the
original
“Π”,
to
which
one
may
again
apply
the
mono-anabelian
algorithms
of

The
point
of
the
mono-anabelian
approach
is
that
although
log
obliterates
the
ring
structures
involved
[cf.
the
second
incompatibility
of
Corollary
3.6,
(iv)],
E
—
i.e.,
“Π”
—
remains
constant
[up
to
isomorphism]
throughout
the
application
of
the
various
operations;
this
implies
that
the
“purely
group-theoretic
constructions”
of
Corollary
1.10
—
i.e.,
Anab,
κAn
—
also
remain
constant
throughout
the
application
of
the
various
operations.
In
particular,
in
the
above
diagram,
despite
the
fact
×
that
log
obliterates
the
ring
structure
of
“k

”,
the
operations
executed
induce
an
isomorphism
between
all
the
“Π’s”
that
appear,
hence
an
isomorphism
between
the
×
initial
and
ﬁnal
“(Π

k
An
)’s”.
At
a
more
technical
level,
this
state
of
aﬀairs
may
be
witnessed
in
the
fact
that
although
[cf.
the
proof
of
the
second
incompatibility
of
Corollary
3.6,
(iv)]
there
exist
incompatible
composites
of
homotopies
involving
the
families
of
homotopies
that
constitute
the
telecore,
contact,
and
observable
structures
involved,
these
composites
become
compatible
as
soon
as
one
augments
the
various
paths
involved
with
a
path
back
down
to
the
core
vertex
“Anab”.
At
a
more
philosophical
level:
This
state
of
aﬀairs,
in
which
the
application
of
log
does
not
immediately
×
yield
an
isomorphism
of
“k
’s”,
but
does
after
“pealing
oﬀ
the
operation
×
of
forgetting
the
group-theoretic
construction
of
k
An
”,
is
reminiscent
of
the
situation
discussed
in
Remark
3.6.6,
(ii),
concerning
“Frobenius

pn
·
(an
isomorphism)”
[i.e.,
where
Frobenius
induces
an
isomorphism
after
“pealing
oﬀ
”
an
appropriate
power
of
p].
(iii)
By
contrast,
the
bi-anabelian
approach
of
Corollary
3.7
may
be
understood
in
the
context
of
the
present
discussion
as
follows:
One
starts
with
an
arbitrarily

declared
“model”
copy
“Π

k

”
of
X
,
then
forgets
the
fact
that
this
copy
was
arbitrarily
declared
a
model
[cf.
the
telecore
structure
of
Corollary
3.7,
(ii)];
this
×
yields
a
copy
“Π

k

”
of
X
on
which
log
acts
in
a
fashion
that
obliterates
the
ring
structure
of
the
arithmetic
data
involved,
hence
leaving
behind,
as
an
invariant
of
log,
only
the
original
“Π”.

Thus,
unlike
the
case
with
the
mono-anabelian
approach,
if
one
tries
to
work
with
×
×
another
model
“Π

k

”
after
applying
log,
then
the
“k

”
portion
of
this
×
new
model
cannot
be
related
to
the
“k

”
portion
of
the
original
model
in
a
consistent
fashion
—
i.e.,
such
a
relation
is
obstructed
by
log,
which
obliterates
the
ring
×
structure
of
k
model
.
Moreover,
unlike
the
case
with
the
mono-anabelian
approach,
there
is
“no
escape
route”
in
the
bi-anabelian
approach
[i.e.,
which
requires
the
use
of
models]
from
this
situation
given
by
taking
a
path
back
down
to
some
core
vertex
[i.e.,
such
as
“Anab”].
Relative
to
the
analogy
with
usual
Frobenius
actions
[cf.
Remark
3.6.6,
(ii)],
this
situation
is
reminiscent
of
the
Frobenius
action
on
the
ideal
deﬁning
the
diagonal
of
a
divided
power
envelope
I⊆O
PD
S
×
S
[where
S
is,
say,
smooth
over
Fp
]
—
i.e.,
Frobenius
simply
maps
I
to
0
in
a
fashion
that
does
not
allow
one
to
“recover,
in
an
isomorphic
fashion,
by
pealing
oﬀ
a
power
of
p”.
[Indeed,
the
data
necessary
to
“peal
oﬀ
a
power
of
p”
consists,
in
essence,
of
a
Frobenius
lifting
—
which
is,
in
essence,
equivalent
to
the
datum
of
a
uniformizing
MF

-object
—
cf.
Remark
3.7.2;
the

In
particular:
Although
it
is
diﬃcult
to
give
a
completely
rigorous
formulation
of
the
?
question
“bi-anabelian
=⇒
mono-anabelian”
raised
in
Remark
1.9.8,
the
state
of
aﬀairs
discussed
above
strongly
suggests
a
negative
answer
to
this
question.
(iv)
The
following
questions
constitute
a
useful
guide
to
understanding
better
the
gap
that
lies
between
the
“success
of
the
mono-anabelian
approach”
and
the
“failure
of
the
bi-anabelian
approach”,
as
documented
in
(i),
(ii),
(iii):
(a)
In
what
capacity
—
i.e.,
as
what
type
of
mathematical
object
[cf.
Remark
3.6.7]
—
does
one
transport
—
i.e.,
“eﬀect
the
coricity
of”
[cf.
con×
dition
(a)
of
(i)]
—
the
ﬁxed
reference
model
of
“k
”
down
to
“future
log-generations”
[i.e.,
smaller
elements
of
L]?
(b)
On
precisely
what
type
of
data
[cf.
Remark
3.6.7]
does
the
comparison
[cf.
condition
(b)
of
(i)]
via
telecore/contact
structures
depend?
That
is
to
say,
in
the
mono-anabelian
approach,
the
answer
to
both
questions
is
given
by
E
[i.e.,
“Π”],
Anab;
by
contrast,
in
the
bi-anabelian
approach,
the
answer

×
to
(b)
necessarily
requires
the
inclusion
of
the
“model

”
—
a
requirement
that
is
incompatible
with
the
coricity
required
by
(a)
[i.e.,
since
log
obliterates
the
ring
×
structure
of
k
model
].

One
way
to
understand
this
state
of
aﬀairs
is
as
follows.
If
one
attempts
to
construct
a
“bi-anabelian
version
of
Anab”,
then
the
requirement
of
coricity
means
that
the
×
“model
k
model
”
employed
in
the
bi-anabelian
reconstruction
algorithm
of
such
a
“bi-anabelian
version
of
Anab”
must
be
compatible
with
the
various
isomorphisms
×
×
∼
k
model
→
k

of
Remark
3.6.1,
(i)
—
where
we
recall
that
the
various
distinct
×
k

’s
are
related
to
one
another
by
log
—
i.e.,
compatible
with
the
“building”,
or
×
“ediﬁce”,
of
k

’s
constituted
by
these
isomorphisms
together
with
the
diagram
of
Remark
3.6.1,
(i).
That
is
to
say,
in
order
for
the
required
coricity
to
hold,
this
bi-anabelian
reconstruction
algorithm
must
be
such
that
it
only
depends
on
×
the
ring
structure
of
k
model
“up
to
log”
—
i.e.,
the
algorithm
must
be
immune
to
the
confusion
[arising
from
log]
of
the
additive
and
multiplicative
structures
that
constitute
this
ring
structure.
On
the
other
hand,
the
bi-anabelian
approach
to
reconstruction
clearly
does
not
satisfy
this
property
[i.e.,
it
requires
that
the
ring
×
structure
of
k
model
be
left
intact].
Remark
3.7.4.
In
the
context
of
the
issue
of
distinguishing
between
the
monoanabelian
and
bi-anabelian
approaches
to
anabelian
geometry
[cf.
Remark
3.7.3],
one
question
that
is
often
posed
is
the
following:
Why
can’t
one
somehow
sneak
a
“ﬁxed
refence
model”
into
a
“monoanabelian
reconstruction
algorithm”
by
ﬁnding,
for
instance,
some
copy
of
Q
or
Qp
inside
the
Galois
group
“Π”
and
then
building
up
some
copy
of
the
hyperbolic
orbicurve
under
consideration
over
this
base
ﬁeld
[i.e.,
this
copy
of
Q,
94
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
Qp
],
which
one
then
takes
as
one’s
“model”,
thus
allowing
one
to
“reduce”
mono-anabelian
problems
to
bi-anabelian
ones
[cf.
Remark
1.9.8]?
One
important
observation,
relative
to
this
question,
is
that
although
it
is
not
so
diﬃcult
to
“construct”
such
copies
of
Q
or
Qp
from
Π,
it
is
substantially
more
diﬃcult
to
construct
copies
of
the
algebraic
closures
of
Q
or
Qp
in
such
a
way
that
the
resulting
absolute
Galois
groups
are
isomorphic
to
the
appropriate
quotient
of
the
given
Galois
group
“Π”
in
a
functorial
fashion
[cf.
Remark
3.7.5
below].
Moreover,
once
one
constructs,
for
instance,
a
universal
pro-ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
an
appropriate
hyperbolic
orbicurve
on
which
Π
acts
[in
a
“natural”,
functorial
fashion],
one
must
specify
[cf.
question
(a)
of
Remark
3.7.3,
(iv)]
in
what
capacity
—
i.e.,
as
what
type
of
mathematical
object
—
one
transports
[i.e.,
“eﬀects
the
coricity
of”]
this
pro-hyperbolic
orbicurve
model
down
to
“future
log-generations”.
Then
if
one
only
takes
a
naive
approach
to
these
issues,
one
is
ultimately
led
to
the
arbitrary
introduction
of
“models”
that
fail
to
be
immune
to
the
application
of
the
log-Frobenius
functor
—
that
is
to
say,
one
ﬁnds
oneself,
in
eﬀect,
in
the
situation
of
the
“bi-anabelian
approach”
discussed
in
Remark
3.7.3.
Thus,
the
above
discussion
may
be
summarized
in
ﬂowchart
form,
as
follows:
construction
of
model
[universal
pro-covering]
schemes
without
essential
use
of
Π
⇓
natural
functorial
action
of
Π
on
model
scheme
is

⇓
∼
must
supplement
model
scheme
with
Π
→
Gal(model
scheme)
⇓
essentially
equivalent
situation
to
“bi-anabelian
approach”.
Put
another
way,
if
one
tries
to
sneak
a
“ﬁxed
refence
model”
that
may
be
constructed
without
essential
use
of
“Π”
into
a
“mono-anabelian
reconstruction
algorithm”,
then
one
ﬁnds
oneself
confronted
with
the
following
two
mutually
exclusive
choices
concerning
the
type
of
mathematical
object
[cf.
question
(a)
of
Remark
3.7.3,
(iv)]
that
one
is
to
assign
to
this
model:
(∗)
the
model
arises
from
“Π”
=⇒
“functorially
trivial
model”;
(∗∗)
the
model
does
not
arise
from
“Π”
=⇒
“bi-anabelian
approach”.
In
particular,
Figures
1
and
2
of
Remark
3.7.3,
(iv),
are
not
[at
least
in
an
“a
priori
sense”]
“essentially
equivalent”.
Remark
3.7.5.
(i)
From
the
point
of
view
of
“constructing
models
of
the
base
ﬁeld
from
Π”
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
3.7.4],
one
natural
approach
to
the
issue
of
ﬁnding
TOPICS
IN
ABSOLUTE
ANABELIAN
GEOMETRY
III
95
“Galois-compatible
models”
is
to
work
with
Kummer
classes
of
scheme-theoretic
functions,
since
Kummer
classes
are
tautologically
compatible
with
Galois
actions.
[Indeed,
the
use
of
Kummer
classes
is
one
important
aspect
of
the
theory
of
§1.]
Moreover,
in
addition
to
being
“tautologically
Galois-compatible”,
Kummer
classes
also
have
the
virtue
of
ﬁtting
into
a
container
def
(Π))
H(Π)
=
H
1
(Π,
μ
Z
[cf.
Corollary
1.10,
(d),
where
we
take
“ΠX
”
to
be
Π]
which
inherits
the
coricity
of
Π
[cf.
question
(a)
of
Remark
3.7.3,
(iv)]
in
a
very
natural,
tautological
fashion.
Thus,
once
one
characterizes,
in
a
“group-theoretic”
fashion,
the
“Kummer
subset”
of
this
container
H(Π)
[i.e.,
the
subset
constituted
by
the
Kummer
classes
that
arise
from
scheme-theoretic
functions],
it
remains
to
reconstruct
the
additive
structure
on
[the
union
with
{0}
of]
the
set
of
Kummer
classes
[cf.
the
theory
of
§1].
If
one
takes
the
point
of
view
of
the
question
posed
in
Remark
3.7.4,
then
it
is
tempting
to
try
to
use
“models”
solely
as
a
means
to
reconstruct
this
additive
structure.
This
approach,
which
combines
the
“purely
group-theoretic”
[i.e.,
“monoanabelian”]
container
H(Π)
with
the
indirect
use
of
“models”
to
reconstruct
the
additive
structure
[or
the
Kummer
subset],
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
intermediate
alternative
between
the
“mono-anabelian”
and
“bi-anabelian”
approaches
discussed
so
far;
in
the
discussion
to
follow,
we
shall
refer
to
this
sort
of
intermediate
approach
as
“pseudo-monoanabelian”.
With
regard
to
implementing
this
pseudo-mono-anabelian
approach,
we
observe
that
the
“automorphism
version
of
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture”
[i.e.,
the
functoriality
of
the
algorithms
of
Corollary
1.10,
applied
to
automorphisms]
allows
one
to
conclude
that
the
additive
structure
“pulled
back
from
a
model
scheme
via
the
Kummer
map”
is
rigid
[i.e.,
remains
unaﬀected
by
automorphisms
of
Π].
On
the
other
hand,
the
“isomorphism
version
of
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture”
[i.e.,
the
functoriality
of
the
algorithms
of
Corollary
1.10,
applied
to
isomorphisms
—
cf.
the
isomorphism
θbi
of
Corollary
3.7,
(ii)]
allows
one
to
conclude
that
this
additive
structure
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
model.
(ii)
The
pseudo-mono-anabelian
approach
gives
rise
to
a
theory
that
satisﬁes
many
of
the
useful
properties
satisﬁed
by
the
mono-anabelian
theory.
Thus,
at
ﬁrst
glance,
it
is
tempting
to
consider
simply
abandoning
the
mono-anabelian
approach,
in
favor
of
the
pseudo-mono-anabelian
approach.
Closer
inspection
reveals,
however,
that
the
situation
is
not
so
simple.
Indeed,
relative
to
the
coricity
requirement
of
Remark
3.7.3,
(i),
(a),
there
is
no
problem
with
allowing
the
“hidden
models”
on
which
the
pseudo-mono-anabelian
approach
depends
in
an
essential
way
to
remain
hidden.
On
the
other
hand,
the
issue
of
relating
[cf.
Remark
3.7.3,
(i),
(b)]
these
hidden
models
to
log-subject
copies
of
these
models
is
more
complicated.
Here,
the
central
problem
may
be
summarized
as
follows
[cf.
Remark
3.7.3,
(iv),
(a),
(b)]:
Problem
(∗type
):
Find
a
type
of
mathematical
object
that
[in
the
context
of
the
framework
discussed
in
Remark
3.7.3,
(i)]
serves
as
a
common
type
of
mathematical
object
for
both
“coric
models”
and
“log-subject
copies”,
96
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
thus
rendering
possible
the
comparison
of
“coric
models”
and
“log-subject
copies”.
That
is
to
say,
in
the
mono-anabelian
approach,
this
“common
type”
is
furnished
by
the
objects
that
constitute
E
and
[in
light
of
the
“group-theoreticity”
of
the
algorithms
of
Corollary
1.10]
Anab;
in
the
bi-anabelian
approach,
the
“common
object”
is
furnished
by
the
“copy
of
X
that
appears
in
the
base-change
(−)
×E
X
”.
Note
that
it
is
precisely
the
existence
of
this
“common
type
of
mathematical
object”
that
renders
possible
the
deﬁnition
of
the
telecore
structure
—
cf.,
especially,
the
functor
δX
of
Corollary
3.7,
(ii).
In
particular,
we
note
that
the
deﬁnition
of
the
diagonal
functor
δX
is
possible
precisely
because
of
the
equality
of
the
types
of
mathematical
object
involved
in
the
two
factors
of
X
×E
X
.
On
the
other
hand,
if,
in
implementing
the
pseudo-mono-anabelian
approach,
one
tries
to
use,
for
instance,
E
[i.e.,
without
including
the
“hidden
model”!],
then
although
this
yields
a
framework
in
which
it
is
possible
to
work
with
the
“mono-anabelian
container
H(Π)”,
this
does
not
allow
one
to
describe
the
contents
[i.e.,
the
Kummer
subset
with
its
ring
structure]
of
this
container.
That
is
to
say,
if
one
describes
these
“contents”
via
“hidden
models”,
then
the
data
contained
in
the
“common
type”
is
not
suﬃcient
for
the
operation
of
relating
this
description
to
the
“conventional
description
of
contents”
that
one
wishes
to
apply
to
the
log-subject
copies.
Indeed,
if
the
coric
models
and
log-subject
copies
only
share
the
container
H(Π),
but
not
the
description
of
its
contents
—
i.e.,
the
description
for
the
coric
models
is
some
“mysterious
description
involving
hidden
models”,
while
the
description
for
the
log-subject
copies
is
the
“standard
Kummer
map
description”
—
then,
a
priori,
there
is
no
reason
that
these
two
descriptions
should
coincide.
For
instance,
if
the
“mysterious
description”
is
not
related
to
the
“standard
description”
via
some
common
description
applied
to
a
common
type
of
mathematical
object,
then,
a
priori,
the
“mysterious
description”
could
be
[among
a
vast
variety
of
possibilities]
one
of
the
following:
(1)
Instead
of
embedding
the
[nonzero
elements
of
the]
base
ﬁeld
into
H(Π)
via
the
usual
Kummer
map,
one
could
consider
the
embedding
obtained
by
composing
the
usual
Kummer
map
with
the
automorphism
induced
by
some
automorphism
of
the
quotient
Π

Gk
[cf.
the
notation
of
Corollary
1.10,
where
we
take
“ΠX
”
to
be
Π]
which
is
not
of
scheme-theoretic
origin
[cf.,
e.g.,
[NSW],
the
Closing
Remark
preceding
Theorem
12.2.7].
(2)
Alternatively,
instead
of
embedding
the
function
ﬁeld
of
the
curve
under
consideration
into
H(Π)
via
the
usual
Kummer
map,
one
could
consider
the
embedding
obtained
by
composing
the
usual
Kummer
map
with
the
×.
automorphism
of
H(Π)
given
by
muliplication
by
some
element
∈
Z
Thus,
in
order
to
ensure
that
such
pathologies
do
not
arise,
it
appears
that
there
is
little
choice
but
to
include
the
ring/scheme-theoretic
models
in
the
common
type
that
one
adopts
as
a
“solution
to
(∗type
)”,
so
that
one
may
apply
the
“standard
Kummer
map
description”
in
a
simultaneous,
consistent
fashion
to
both
the
coric
data
and
the
log-subject
data.
But
[since
these
models
are
“functorially
obstructed
from
being
subsumed
into
Π”
—
cf.
Remark
3.7.4]
the
inclusion
of
such
ring/schemetheoretic
models
amounts
precisely
to
the
“bi-anabelian
approach”
discussed
in
Remark
3.7.3
[cf.,
especially,
Figure
2
of
Remark
3.7.3,

(iii)
From
a
“physical”
point
of
view,
it
is
natural
to
think
of
data
that
satisﬁes
some
sort
of
coricity
—
such
as
the
étale
fundamental
group
Π
—
as
being
×
“massless”,
like
light.
By
comparison,
the
arithmetic
data
“k
”
—
on
which
the
log-Frobenius
functor
acts
non-isomorphically
—
may
be
thought
of
as
being
like
matter
which
has
“weight”.
This
dichotomy
is
reminiscent
of
the
dichotomy
discussed
in
the
Introduction
to
[Mzk16]
between
“étale-like”
and
“Frobenius-like”
structures.
Thus,
in
summary:
coricity,
“étale-like”
structures
←→
massless,
like
light
“Frobenius-like”
structures
←→
matter
of
positive
mass.
From
this
point
of
view,
the
discussion
of
(i),
(ii)
may
be
summarized
as
follows:
Even
if
the
container
H(Π)
is
massless,
it
one
tries
to
use
it
to
carry
“cargo
of
substantial
weight”,
then
the
resulting
package
[of
container
plus
cargo]
is
no
longer
massless.
On
the
other
hand,
the
very
existence
of
mono-anabelian
algorithms
as
discussed
in
§1,
§2
corresponds,
in
this
analogy,
to
the
“conversion
of
light
into
matter”
[cf.
the
point
of
view
of
Remark
1.9.7]!
(iv)
Relative
to
the
dichotomy
discussed
in
the
Introduction
to
[Mzk16]
between
“étale-like”
and
“Frobenius-like”
structures,
the
problem
observed
in
the
present
paper
with
the
bi-anabelian
approach
may
be
thought
of
as
an
example
of
the
phenomenon
of
the
non-applicability
of
Galois
[i.e.,
“étale-like”]
descent
with
respect
to
“Frobenius-like”
morphisms
[i.e.,
the
existence
of
descent
data
for
a
“Frobeniuslike”
morphism
which
cannot
be
descended
to
an
object
on
the
codomain
of
the
morphism].
In
classical
arithmetic
geometry,
this
phenomenon
may
be
seen,
for
instance,
in
the
non-descendability
of
Galois-invariant
coherent
ideals
with
respect
to
morphisms
such
as
Spec(k[t])
→
Spec(k[tn
])
[where
n
≥
2
is
an
integer;
k
is
a
ﬁeld],
or
[cf.
the
discussion
of
“X
×E
X
”
in
Remark
3.7.2]
the
diﬀerence
between
an
integrable
connection
and
an
integrable
connection
equipped
with
a
compatible
Frobenius
action
[e.g.,
of
the
sort
that
arises
from
an
MF
∇
-object].
Remark
3.7.6.
With
regard
to
the
pseudo-mono-anabelian
approach
discussed
in
Remark
3.7.5,
one
may
make
the
following
further
observations.
(i)
In
order
to
carry
out
the
pseudo-mono-anabelian
approach
[or,
a
fortiori,
the
mono-anabelian
approach],
it
is
necessary
to
use
the
full
proﬁnite
étale
fundamental
group
of
a
hyperbolic
orbicurve,
say,
of
strictly
Belyi
type.
That
is
to
say,
if,
for
instance,
one
attempts
to
use
the
geometrically
pro-Σ
fundamental
group
of
a
hyperbolic
curve
[i.e.,
where
Σ
is
a
set
of
primes
which
is
not
equal
to
the
set
of
all
primes],
then
the
crucial
injectivity
of
the
Kummer
map
[cf.
Proposition
1.6,
(i)]
fails
to
hold.
In
particular,
this
failure
of
injectivity
means
that
one
cannot
work
with
the
crucial
additive
structure
on
[the
union
with
{0}
of]
the
image
of
the
Kummer
map.
(ii)
In
a
similar
vein,
if
one
attempts
to
work,
for
instance,
with
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
a
number
ﬁeld
—
i.e.,
in
the
absence
of
any
geometric
fundamental
group
of
a
hyperbolic
orbicurve
over
the
number
ﬁeld
—
then,
in
order
to
work
with
Kummer
classes,
one
must
contend
with
the
nontrivial
issue
of
ﬁnding
an

appropriate
[proﬁnite]
cyclotome
[i.e.,
copy
of
“Z(1)”]
to
replace
the
“curve-based
cyclotome
MX
”
of
Proposition
1.4,
(ii)
[cf.
also
Remark
1.9.5].
98
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
(iii)
Next,
we
observe
that
if
one
attempts
to
construct
“models
of
the
base
ﬁeld”
via
the
theory
of
“characters
of
qLT-type”
as
in
[Mzk20],
§3
[cf.
also
the
theory
of
[Mzk2],
§4],
then
although
[just
as
was
the
case
with
Kummer
classes]
such
“qLT-models
of
the
base
ﬁeld”
are
tautologically
Galois-compatible
and
admit
a
coricity
inherited
from
the
coricity
of
Π,
[unlike
the
case
with
Kummer
classes]
the
essential
use
of
p-adic
Hodge
theory
implies
that
the
resulting
“construction
of
the
base
ﬁeld”
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
1.9.5]
is
incompatible
with
the
operation
of
passing
from
global
[e.g.,
number]
ﬁelds
to
local
ﬁelds
[i.e.,
does
not
admit
an
analogue
of
the
ﬁrst
portion
of
Corollary
1.10,
(h)],
hence
also
incompatible
with
the
operation
of
relating
the
resulting
“constructions
of
the
base
ﬁeld”at
diﬀerent
localizations
of
a
number
ﬁeld.
Such
localization
[i.e.,
in
the
terminology
of
§5,
“panalocalization”]
properties
will
play
a
key
role
in
the
theory
of
§5
below.
(iv)
In
the
context
of
(iii),
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
geometrically
pro-Σ
fundamental
groups
as
in
(i)
also
fail
to
be
compatible
with
localization.
Indeed,
even
if
some
sort
of
pro-Σ
analogue
of
the
theory
of
§1
is,
in
the
future,
obtained
for
the
primes
lying
over
prime
numbers
∈
Σ,
such
an
analogue
is
impossible
at
the
primes
lying
over
prime
numbers
∈
Σ
[since,
as
is
easily
veriﬁed,
at
such
primes,
the
automorphisms
of
Gk
[notation
of
Corollary
1.10]
that
are
not
of
scheme-theoretic
origin
may
extend,
in
general,
to
automorphisms
of
the
full
arithmetic
[geometrically
pro-Σ]
fundamental
group].
(v)
At
the
time
of
writing,
it
appears
to
be
rather
diﬃcult
to
give
a
monoanabelian
“group-theoretic”
algorithm
as
in
Theorem
1.9
in
the
case
of
number
ﬁelds
by
somehow
“gluing
together”
[mono-anabelian,
“group-theoretic”]
algorithms
[cf.
the
approach
via
p-adic
Hodge
theory
discussed
in
(iii)]
applied
at
nonarchimedean
completions
of
the
number
ﬁeld.
That
is
to
say,
if
one
tries,
for
instance,
to
construct
a
number
ﬁeld
F
as
a
subset
of
the
product
of
copies
of
F
constructed
at
various
nonarchimedean
completions
of
F
,
then
it
appears
to
be
a
highly
nontrivial
issue
to
reconstruct
the
correspondences
between
the
various
“local
copies”
of
F
.
Indeed,
if
one
attempts
to
work
with
abelianizations
of
local
and
global
Galois
groups
and
apply
class
ﬁeld
theory
[i.e.,
in
the
fashion
of
[Uchi],
in
the
case
of
function
ﬁelds],
then
one
may
only
recover
the
“global
copy”
of
F
×
embedded
in
the
idèles
up
to
an
indeterminacy
that
involves,
in
particular,
various
“solenoids”
[cf.,
e.g.,
[ArTt],
Chapter
Nine,
Theorem
3].
On
the
other
hand,
if
one
attempts
to
work
with
local
and
global
Kummer
classes,
then
one
must
contend
with
the
phenomenon
that
it
is
not
clear
how
to
lift
local
Kummer
classes
to
global
Kummer
classes;
that
is
to
say,
the
indeterminacies
that
occur
for
such
liftings
are
of
a
nature
roughly
reminiscent
of
the
global
Kummer
classes
whose
vanishing
is
implied
by
the
so-called
Leopoldt
Conjecture
[i.e.,
in
its
formulation
concerning
p-adic
localizations
of
units
of
a
number
ﬁeld],
which
is
unknown
in
general
at
the
time
of
writing.
Remark
3.7.7.
(i)
One
way
to
interpret
the
fact
that
the
log-Frobenius
operation
log
is
not
a
ring
homomorphism
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remarks
3.7.3,
3.7.4,
3.7.5]
is
to
think

“log”
as
constituting
a
sort
of
“wall”
that
separates
the
two
“distinct
scheme
theories”
that
occur
before
and
after
its
application.
The
étale
fundamental
groups
that
arise
in
these
“distinct
scheme
theories”
thus
necessarily
correspond
to
disout
tinct,
unrelated
basepoints.
Thus,
if,
for
i

is
a
copy
of
the
out
outer
Galois
action
on
the
geometric
fundamental
group
“Gk

ΔX
”
of
Theorem
1.9
that
arises
in
one
of
these
two
“distinct
scheme
theories”
separated
by
the
“log-wall”,
then
although
this
log-wall
cannot
be
penetrated
by
ring
structures
[i.e.,
by
“scheme
theory”],
it
can
be
penetrated
by
the
abstract
proﬁnite
group
structure
of
the
Gi
—
cf.
the
Galois-equivariance
of
the
map
“logk
”
of
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(i).
Moreover,
since
the
“abstract
outer
action
pair”
[i.e.,
an
abstract
proﬁnite
group
out
equipped
with
an
outer
action
by
another
abstract
proﬁnite
group]

we
thus

that

Once
one

it

to

what

“additional

Typically,
“purely

serve
as
natural
containers
for
such
additional

[cf.,
e.g.,

Thus,
the

The
fundamental
diﬀerence
that
distinguishes
the
pseudo-mono-anabelian
approach
discussed
in
Remark
3.7.5
from
the
mono-anabelian
approach
is
the
issue
of
whether
this
“choice”
is
speciﬁed
in
terms
that
depend
on
the
scheme
theory
that
gives
rise
to
the
choice
[i.e.,
the
pseudo-monoanabelian
case]
or
not
[i.e.,
the
mono-anabelian
case,
in
which
the
choice
may
be
speciﬁed
in
language
that
depends
only
on
the
abstract
group
out
structure
of,
say,
“Gi

Δi
”].
In
fact,
the
discussion
in
Remark
3.7.5,
(ii)
[cf.
also
Figs.
1,
2
of
Remark
3.7.3,
(iv)],
may
be
depicted
via
a
similar
illustration
to
the
above
illustration
of
the
“logwall”
in
which
the
“log-wall”
is
replaced
by
a
“model-wall”
separating
“reference
models”
from
“log-subject
copies”
of
such
models.
In
Remark
3.7.5,
(ii),
special
attention
was
given
to
the
situation
in
which
the
“additional
data”
consists
of
the
“additive
structure”
on
the
image
of
the
Kummer
map.
When
the
Δi
’s
of
(i)
are
given
by
the
birational
geometric
fundamental
groups
“ΔηX
”
of
Theorem
1.11,
another
example
of
such
“additional
data”
in
which
the
speciﬁcation
of
the
“choice”
depends
on
“scheme
theory”
[and
hence
cannot,
at
least
a
priori,
be
shared
on
both
sides
of
the
log-wall]
is
given
by
the
speciﬁcation
of
some
ﬁnite
collection
of
closed
points
corresponding
to
the
cusps
of
some
aﬃne
hyperbolic
curve
that
lies
in
some
given
scheme
theory
[cf.
Remark
1.11.5].
(iii)
With
regard
to
the
issue
of
“specifying
some
ﬁnite
collection
of
closed
points
corresponding
to
the
cusps
of
an
aﬃne
hyperbolic
curve”
discussed
in
the
ﬁnal
portion
of
(ii),
we
note
that
in
certain
special
cases,
a
“purely
group-theoretic”
speciﬁcation
is
in
fact
possible.
For
instance,
if,
in
the
notation
of
Theorem
1.11,
X
is
a
hyperelliptic
curve
whose
unique
nontrivial
k-automorphism
is
given
by
its
hyperelliptic
involution,
then
the
set
of
points
ﬁxed
by
the
hyperelliptic
involution
constitutes
such
an
example
in
which
a
“purely
group-theoretic”
speciﬁcation
can
be
made
by
considering
the
conjugacy
classes
of
inertia
groups
“Ix
”
ﬁxed
by
the
unique
nontrivial
outer
automorphism
of
ΔηX
that
commutes
with
the
given
outer
action
of
Gk
on
ΔηX
.
(iv)
The
“log-wall”
discussed
in
(i)
is
reminiscent
of
the
constant
indeterminacy
arising
from
morphisms
of

Many

are
not
formulated
entirely
rigorously.
Thus,

it
is
quite
possible
that
certain
of
the
obstacles
pointed
out
in
these

can
be
overcome.
Nevertheless,
we
presented
these
remarks
in
the
hope
that
they
could
aid
in
elucidating
the
content
of
and
motivation
[from
the
point
of

of
the
author]
behind
the
various
rigorously
formulated
results
of
the

Archimedean

Compatibility
In
the
present
§4,
we
present
an
archimedean
version
[cf.
Corollary
4.5]
of
the
theory
of
§3,
i.e.,
we
interpret
the
theory
of
§2
in
terms
of
a
certain
compatibility
with
the
“log-Frobenius
functor”.
Deﬁnition
4.1.
(i)
Let
k
be
a
CAF
[cf.
§0].
Write
Ok
⊆
k
for
the
subset
of
elements
of
absolute
value
≤
1,
Ok×
⊆
Ok
for
the
subgroup
of
units
[i.e.,
elements
of
absolute
value
equal
to
1
—
cf.
[Mzk17],
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(ii)],
Ok
⊆
Ok
for
the
multiplicative
monoid
of
def
nonzero
elements,
and
k
∼

k
×
=
k\{0}
for
the
universal
covering
of
k
×
.
Thus,
k
∼

k
×
is
uniquely
determined,
up
to
unique
isomorphism,
as
a
pointed
topological
space
and,
moreover,
[as
is
well-known]
may
be
constructed
explicitly
by
considering
homotopy
classes
of
paths
on
k
×
;
moreover,
the
pointed
topological
space
k
∼
admits
a
natural
topological
group
structure,
determined
by
the
topological
group
structure
of
k
×
.
Note
that
the
“inverse”
of
the
exponential
map
k
→
k
×
[given
by
the
usual
power
series]
determines
an
isomorphism
of
topological
groups
∼
logk
:
k
∼
→
k
—
which
we
shall
refer
to
as
the
logarithm
associated
to
k.
Next,
let
Xell
be
an
elliptically
admissible
Aut-holomorphic
orbispace
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.1,
(i);
Remark
2.1.1].
We
shall
refer
to
as
a

structure
on
Xell
any
isomorphism
of
topological
ﬁelds

∼
def
κk
:
k

AXell
=
AXell

—
where
we
write
AXell
for
the
“Ap
”
of
Corollary
2.7,
(e)
[equipped
with
various
topological
and
algebraic
structures],
which
may
be
identiﬁed
[hence
considered
as
∼
an
object
that
is
independent
of
“p”]
via
the
various
isomorphisms
“Ap
→
Ap
”
of
Corollary
2.7,
(e),
together
with
the
functoriality
of
the
algorithms
of
Corollary
2.7.
Note
that
k,
k
×
,
k
∼
,
and
AXell
are
equipped
with
natural
Aut-holomorphic
structures,
with
respect
to
which
κk
determines
co-holomorphicizations
between
k
and
AXell
,
as
well
as
between
k
∼
and
AXell
;
moreover,
these
co-holomorphicizations
are
compatible
with
logk
.
Next,
let
T
∈
{TF,
TCG,
TLG,

TH,
TH}
—
where
TF,
TCG,
TLG,
TM
as

we
write

for
the

replaced

to

Since

from

is
clearly

deﬁned
[i.e.,

Thus,
for

the

determines
various

[as
well
as

of

(iv)
Observe
that
[in
the
notation
of
(i)]
the
ﬁeld
structure
of
k
determines,
via
the
inverse
morphism
to
logk
,
a
structure
of
topological
ﬁeld
on
the
topological
group
k
∼
;
moreover,
κk
determines
a
k
∼
-Kummer
structure
on
Xell
∼
κk∼
:
k
∼
→
AXell
which
may
be
uniquely
characterized
[i.e.,
among
the
two
k
∼
-Kummer
structures
on
Xell
]
by
the
property
that
the
co-holomorphicization
determined
by
κk∼
coincides
with
the
co-holomorphicization
determined
by
composing
the
composite
of
natural
maps
k
∼

k
×
→
k
with
the
co-holomorphicization
determined
by
κk
.
In
particular,
[cf.
(i)]
the
co-holomorphicizations
determined
by
κk
,
κk∼
are
compatible
104
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
with
logk
.
Since
the
various
operations
applied
here
to
construct
this
ﬁeld
structure
on
k
∼
[such
as,
for
instance,
the
power
series
used
to
deﬁne
logk
]
are
clearly
intrinsically
deﬁned
[cf.
the
natural
functors
deﬁned
in

we
thus
obtain
that
the
construction
that
assigns
(the
topological
ﬁeld
k,
with
its
Kummer
structure
κk
)
→
(the
topological
ﬁeld
k

,
with
its
Kummer

)
determines
a
natural
functor
hol
hol
→
CTF
logTF,TF
:
CTF
—
which
we
shall
refer
to
as
the
log-Frobenius
functor.
Since
logk
determines
a
functorial
isomorphism
between
the
ﬁelds
k,
k
∼
,
it
follows
immediately
that
the
functor
logTF,TF
is
isomorphic
to
the
identity
functor
[hence,
in
particular,
is
an
equivalence
of
categories].
By
composing
logTF,TF
with
the
various
natural
functors
deﬁned
in
(iii),
we
also
obtain,
for
T
∈
{TLG,
TCG,

a
functor
hol
logTF,T
:
CTF
→
CThol
—
which
[by
abuse
of
terminology]
we
shall
also
refer
to
as
“the

In
a
similar
vein,

where

be

The

is
essentially

Example

Remark
4.1.2.
Although,
to
simplify
the
discussion,
we
have
chosen
to
require
that
the
structure-orbispace
always
be
elliptically
admissible,
and
that
the
base
ﬁeld
always
be
a
CAF,
many
aspects
of
the
theory
of
the
present
§4
may
be
generalized
to
accommodate
“structure-orbispaces”
that
are
Aut-holomorphic
orbispaces
that
arise
from
more
general
hyperbolic
orbicurves
[cf.,
e.g.,
Propositions

over
arbitrary
archimedean
ﬁelds
[i.e.,
either
CAF’s

Such
generalizations,
however,
are
beyond

the

[hence,

Proof.
The

follows
immediately
from
the
required

of

[cf.
also
the

To
verify
the
id-rigidity
of

it
suﬃces
to
observe
that
for
any
object
X

Ob(EA),
which
necessarily
arises
from
some
elliptically
admissible
hyperbolic
orbicurve
X
over
a
CAF,
the
full
subcategory
of

consisting
of
objects
that
map
to
X
may,
by
Corollary
2.3,
(i)
[cf.
also
[Mzk14],
Lemma
1.3,
(iii)],
be
identiﬁed
with
the
category
of
ﬁnite
étale
R-localizations
“LocR

[i.e.,
the

of
the
category
of

étale

of
[Mzk10],
§2,
obtained
by
considering

R-linear
morphisms].
Thus,
the
id-rigidity
of
EA
follows
immediately
from
the
slimness
assertion
of
Lemma
4.3
below.
In
light
of
the
bijectivity
portion
of
assertion
(i),
the
id-rigidity

follows
in
a
similar
fashion.
This

the

of

Assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions
[and
the

of

Remark
4.2.1.
Note
that,
unlike
the
case
with
Proposition
3.2,
(iv),
the
idrigidity
portion
of
Proposition
4.2,
(i),
is
[as
is
easily
verifed]
false
for
the
“C”
and
“C”
versions
of
CThol
,
CThol-sB
.
The
following
result
is
well-known.
Lemma
4.3.
(Slimness
of
Archimedean
Fundamental
Groups)
Let
X
be
a
hyperbolic
orbicurve
over
an
archimedean
ﬁeld
kX
.
Then
the
étale
fundamental
group
ΠX
of
X
is
slim.
Proof.
Let
k
X
be
an
algebraic
closure
of
kX
.
Thus,
we
have
an
exact
sequence
of
proﬁnite
groups
1
→
ΔX
→
ΠX
→
G
→
1
def
def
[where
ΔX
=
π1
(X
×kX
k
X
);
G
=
Gal(k
X
/kX
)].
Since
ΔX
is
slim
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk20],
Proposition
2.3,
(i)],
it
suﬃces
to
consider
the
case
where
there
exists
an
element
σ
∈
ΠX
that
maps
to
a
nontrivial
element
σG
∈
G
∼
=
Z/2Z
and,
moreover,
commutes
with
some
open
subgroup
H
⊆
ΠX
.
We
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
H
⊆
ΔX
,
and,
moreover,
that
H
corresponds
to
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
X
×kX
k
X
which
is
a
hyperbolic
curve
of
genus
≥
2.
In
particular,
by
replacing
X
by
the
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
X
determined
by
the
open
subgroup
of
ΠX
generated
by
H
and
σ,
we
may
assume
that
σ
lies
in
the
center
of
ΠX
,
and,
moreover,
that
X
is
a
hyperbolic
curve
of
genus
≥
2.
In
particular,
by
ﬁlling
in
the
cusps
of
X,
we
may
assume
further
that
X
is
proper.
Now
if
l
is
any
prime
number,
then
the
ﬁrst
Chern
class
of,
say,
the
canonical
bundle
of
X
determines
a
generator
of
H

(1))
∼
=
H
2
(ΔX
,
Ql

[where
the
“(1)”
denotes
a
Tate
∼
twist],
hence
an
isomorphism
of
G-modules
H
2
(ΔX
,
Ql
)
→
Ql
(−1).
In
particular,
TOPICS

it
follows
that
σ
acts
nontrivially
on
H
2
(ΔX
,
Ql
),
in
contradiction
to
the
fact
that
σ
lies
in
the
center
of
ΠX
.
This
contradiction
completes
the
proof
of
Lemma
4.3.
Lemma
4.4.
(Topological
Distinguishability
of
Additive
and
Multiplicative
Structures)
Let
k
be
a
CAF
[cf.
Deﬁnition
4.1,
(i)].
Then
[in
the
notation
of
Deﬁnition
4.1,
(i)]
no
composite
of
the
form
k×
α
−→
(k
∼
)×
→
k∼

k×
—
where
the
“×”
of
“(k
∼
)×
”
is
relative
to
the
ﬁeld
structure
of
k
∼
[cf.
Deﬁnition
4.1,
(iv)];
α
is
an
isomorphism
of
topological
groups;
“→”
is
the
natural
inclusion;
“”
is
the
natural
map
—
is
bijective.
Proof.
Indeed,
the
non-injectivity
of
k

k
×
implies
that
the
composite
under
consideration
fails
to
be
injective.

given
in

In
particular,
the
various
homotopies
discussed
above
yield
a
family
of
homotopies
which
determines
an
observable
Slog
,
as
desired.
Moreover,
it
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions
—
i.e.,
in
essence,
because
the
various
structure-orbispaces
that
appear
remain
“undisturbed”
by
the
various
manipulations
involving
arithmetic
data
that
arise
from
“ιlog,

“ι×

—
that
this
family
of
homotopies
is
compatible
with
the

that
constitute

structures
of

This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iv).
Suppose
that
D≤2
admits
a
structure
of
core
on
D≤1
in
a
fashion
that
is
compatible
with
the
observable
Slog
of
(iii).
Then
this
core
structure
determines
a
homotopy
ζ0
for
the
pair
of
paths
([id
],
[id−1
]
◦
[log])
[for

∈
L];
thus,
by
composing
the
result
ζ0
of
applying
λ×
to
ζ0
with
the
homotopy
ζ1
associated
[via
Slog
]
to
the
pair
of
paths
([λ×
]
◦
[id−1
]
◦
[log],
[λ∼
]
◦
[id
])
[of
type
(1)]
and
then
with
the
homotopy
ζ2
associated
[via
Slog
]
to
the
pair
of
paths
([λ∼
]
◦
[id
],
[λ×
]
◦
[id
])
[of
type
(4)],
we
obtain
a
natural
transformation
ζ1
=
ζ2
◦
ζ1
◦
ζ0
:
λ×
◦
id
→
λ×
◦
id
—
which,
in
order
for
the
desired
compatibility
to
hold,
must
coincide
with
the
“identity
homotopy”
[of
type
(5)].
On
the
other
hand,
by
writing
out
explicitly
the
meaning
of
such
an
equality
ζ1
=
id,
we
conclude
that
we
obtain
a
contradiction
to
Lemma
4.4.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
ﬁrst
incompatibility
of
assertion
(iv).
The
proof
of
the
second
incompatibility
of
assertion
(iv)
is
entirely
similar
[cf.
the
proof
of
Corollary
3.6,
(iv)].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iv).
Finally,
the
total
-rigidity
portion
of
assertion
(v)
follows
immediately
from
Proposition
4.2,
(i)
[cf.
also
the
ﬁnal
portion
of
Proposition
4.2,
(ii)];
the
remainder
of
assertion
(v)
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions.
Remark
4.5.1.

The
“output”
of
the
observable
Slog
of
Corollary
4.5,

to

of

[cf.
Corollary
4.5,

Finally,
the
incompatibility
assertions
of
Corollary
4.5,
(iv),
may
be
thought
of
as
a
statement
of
the
non-existence
of
some
“universal

that
maps

in

fashion
that
is

with

“

“←”
of

(ii)
In
words,
the
essential
content
of
Corollary
4.5
may
be
understood
as
follows
[cf.
the
“intuitive
diagram”
of
(i)]:
Although
the
operation
represented
by
the
log-Frobenius
functor
is
compatible
with
the
[Aut-holomorphic]
structure-orbispaces,
hence
with
the
“software”
constituted
by
the
algorithms
of
Corollary
2.7,
it
is
not
compatible
with
the
additive
or
multiplicative
structures
on
the
various
arithmetic
data
involved
—
cf.
Remark
3.6.1.
That
is
to
say,
more
concretely,
if
one
starts
with
an
elliptically
admissible
Autholomorphic
orbispace
X
on
which
[for
some
CAF
k]
k
×
“acts
via
the
local
linear
holomorphic
structures
of
Corollary
2.7,
(e)”
[i.e.,
X
is
equipped
with
a
Kummer
κ
structure
X

k
×
],
then
applies
logk
to
the
universal
covering
k
∼
→
k
×
to
equip
k
∼
with
a
ﬁeld
structure,
with
respect
to
which
k
∼
“acts”
on
some

X
of
X

(k


X

[where
the
“×”
of
“(k
∼
)×
”
is
taken
with
respect
to
this
ﬁeld
structure
of
k
∼
],
then
∼
although
the
“actions”
of
k
×
,
(k
∼
)×
on
X
→
X
are
not
strictly
compatible
[i.e.,
the
diagram
does
not
commute],
they
become
“compatible”
if
one
“loosens
one’s
notion
of
compatibility”
to
the
notion
of
being
“compatible
with
the
[Aut-]holomorphic
structure”
of
the
various
objects
involved
[cf.
the
analogy
of
Remark
2.7.3].
This
state
of
aﬀairs
may
be
expressed
formally
as
a
compatibility
between
the
various
hol
in
Deﬁnition
4.1,
(i),
co-holomorphicizations
involved
[cf.
the
deﬁnition
of
CTH
(ii),
(iii)].
In
summary,
as
should
be
evident
from
its
statement,
Corollary
4.5
is
intended
as
an
archimedean
analogue
of
Corollary
3.6.
In
particular,
the
“general
formal
content”
of
Remarks
3.6.1,
3.6.2,
3.6.3,
3.6.5,
3.6.6,
and
3.6.7
applies
to
the
present
archimedean
situation,
as
well.
Remark
4.5.2.
By
comparison
to
the
nonarchimedean
case
treated
in
§3,
certain
—
but
not
all!
—
of
the
“arrows”
that
appear
in
the
archimedean
case
go
in
the
opposite
direction
to
the
nonarchimedean
case.
This
is
somewhat
reminiscent
of
the
“product
formula”
in
elementary
number
theory,
where,
for
instance,
positive
112
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
powers
of
prime
numbers
→
0
at
nonarchimedean
primes,
but
→
∞
at
archimedean
primes.
In
the
context
of
Corollary
4.5,
perhaps
the
most
important
example
of
this
phenomenon
is
given
by
“ι×
”.
This
leads
to
a
somewhat
diﬀerent
structure
for
the
observable
Slog
of
Corollary
4.5,
(iii)
—
involving
“archimedean”
homotopies
of
arbitrarily
large
“length”
[cf.
the
“non-[γ]-portion”
of
the
pairs
of
paths
of
types
(1),
(2),
(3),
(4)
in
the
proof
of
Corollary
4.5,
(iii)]
—
from
the
structure
of
the
observable
Slog
of
Corollary
3.6,
(iii)
—
which
involves
“nonarchimedean”
paths
of
bounded
“length”
[cf.
the
“non-[γ]-portion”
of
the
pairs
of
paths
of
types
(1),
(2)
in
the
proof
of
Corollary
3.6,
(iii)].
Remark
4.5.3.
(i)
By
replacing
“λ×pf
”
by
“λ∼
”,
“ι×
=
ι×
:
λ×
→
λ×pf
”
by
“ι×
=
ι×
:
λ∼
→
λ×
”,
and
“Corollary
1.10”
by
“Corollary
2.7”,
[and
making
various
other
suitable
revisions]
one
obtains
an
essentially
straightforward
“Aut-holomorphic
translation”
of
the
bi-anabelian
incompatibility
result
given
in
Corollary
3.7.
We
leave
the
routine
details
to
the
reader.
(ii)
The
“general
formal
content”
of
Remarks
3.7.1,
3.7.2,
3.7.3,
3.7.4,
3.7.5,
3.7.7,
and
3.7.8
applies
to
the
archimedean
analogue
of
Corollary
3.7
discussed
in
(i)
—
cf.
also
the
analogy
of
Remark
2.7.3;
the
discussion
in
Remark
2.7.4
of
“ﬁxed
reference
models”
in
the
context
of
the
deﬁnition
of
the
notion
of
a
“holomorphic
structure”.
(iii)
With
regard
to
the
discussion
in
Remark
3.7.4
of
“functorially
trivial
models”
[i.e.,
models
that
“arise
from
Π”
without
essential
use
of
Π,
hence
are
equipped
with
trivial
functorial
actions
of
Π],
we
note
that
although
“the
Galois
group
Π”
does
not
appear
in
the
present
archimedean
context,
the
“functorial
detachment”
of
such
“functorially
trivial
models”
means,
for
instance,
that
if
one
regards
some
model
Xmodel
as
“arising”
from
an
elliptically
admissible
Aut-holomorphic
orbispace
X
in
a
“trivial
fashion”,
then
when
one
applies
the
“elliptic
cuspidalization”
portion
of
the
algorithm
of
Corollary
2.7,
(b),
the
various
coverings
of
X
involved
in
this
elliptic
cuspidalization
algorithm
functorially
induce
trivial
coverings
of
Xmodel
,
hence
do
not
give
rise
to
a
functorial
isomorphism
of
the
respective
“base
ﬁelds”
[cf.
Remark
2.7.3]
of
X,
Xmodel
.
(iv)
With
regard
to
the
discussion
in
Remark
3.7.5,
one
may
give
an
archimedean
analogue
of
the
“pathological
versions
of
the
Kummer
map”
given
in
Remark
3.7.5,
∼
(ii),
by
composing
the
k-Kummer
structure
[cf.
Deﬁnition
4.1,
(i)]
“κk

”,
restricted,
say,
to
k
×
,
with
the
[non-additive!]
automorphism
of
∼

that
acts
as
the
identity
on

is
given

raising
to

Section
5:
Global
Log-Frobenius
Compatibility
In
the
present
§5,
we
globalize
the
theory
of
§3,
§4.
This
globalization
allows
one
to
construct
canonical
rigid
compacta
—
i.e.,
canonical
integral
structures
—
that
enable
one
to
consider
[“pana-”]localizations
of
global
arithmetic
line
bundles
[cf.
Corollary
5.5]
without
obliterating
the
“volume-theoretic”
information
inherent
in
the
theory
of
global
arithmetic
degrees,
and
in
a
fashion
that
is
compatible
with
the
operation
of
“mono-analyticization”
[cf.
Corollary
5.10]
—
i.e.,
the
operation
of
“disabling
the
rigidity”
of
one
of
the
“two
combinatorial
dimensions”
of
a
ring
[cf.
Remark
5.6.1].
The
resulting
theory
is
reminiscent,
in
certain
formal
respects,
of
the
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
of
[Mzk1],
[Mzk4]
[cf.
Remark
5.10.3].
Deﬁnition
5.1.
(i)
Let
F
be
a
number
ﬁeld.
Then
we
shall
write
V(F
)
for
the
set
of
[archimedean
def
{
F
},
where
the
and
nonarchimedean]
valuations
of
F
,
and
V
(F
)
=
V(F
)
symbol
“
F
”
is
to
be
thought
of
as
representing
the
global
ﬁeld
F
,
or,
alternatively,
the
generic
prime
of
F
.
If
F
is
an
algebraic
closure
of
F
,
then
we
shall
write

V(K);

V
(F

=

[where
K
ranges
over
the
ﬁnite
extensions
of
F
in
F
]
for
the
inverse
limits
relative
to
the
evident
systems
of
morphisms.
The
inverse
system
of
“
K
’s”
determines
a
unique
global
element
F
∈
V
(F
/F
);
the
other
elements
of
V
(F
/F
)
lie
in
the
image
of
the
natural
injection
V(F
/F
)
→
V
(F
/F
)
and
will
be
called
local;
moreover,
we
have
a
natural
decomposition

V(F
/F
)
=
V(F
/F
)arc
V(F
/F
)non
into
archimedean
and
nonarchimedean
local
elements.
There
is
a
natural
continuous
action
of
Gal(F
/F
)
on
the
pro-sets
V(F
/F
),
V
(F
/F
).
For
K
⊆
F
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
F
,
V(K),
V
(K)
may
be
identiﬁed,
respectively,
with
the
sets
of
Gal(F
/K)
(⊆
Gal(F
/F
))-orbits
V(F
/F
)/Gal(F
/K),
V
(F
/F
)/Gal(F
/K)
of
V(F
/F
),
V
(F
/F
).

Let
X
be
an
elliptically
admissible
[cf.
[Mzk21],
Deﬁnition

hyperbolic
orbicurve
over
a
totally
imaginary
number
ﬁeld
F
[so
X
is
also
of
strictly
Belyi
type
—
cf.
Remark

Write
ΠX

fundamental

X
[for

some
choice
of
basepoint];
ΠX

GF

Gal(F

for
the

surjection
onto
the
absolute
Galois
group
GF
of
F
[for
some
choice
of
algebraic
closure
F
of
F
];
ΔX
⊆
ΠX
for
the
kernel
of
this
surjection
[which
may
be
characterized
“grouptheoretically”
as
the
maximal
topologically
ﬁnite

closed
normal

of
ΠX
—
cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk9],
Lemma
1.1.4,

Write
F
mod
⊆
F
for
the
“ﬁeld
of

of

i.e.,
the
subﬁeld
of
F
determined
by
the
[open]
image
def
of
Aut(XF
)
[i.e.,
the
group
of

114
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
Aut(F

(⊇

);
Aut(X),
Aut(F
)
for
the
respective
automorphism
groups
of
the
schemes
X,
Spec(F
).
For
simplicity,
we
also
make
the
following
assumption
on
X:
F
is
Galois
over
F
mod
;
the
natural
homomorphism
Aut(X)
→
Aut(F
)
surjects
onto
Gal(F/F
mod

(⊆
Aut(F
));
we
have
a
natural
isomorphism
∼
Aut(X/F

→
Aut(XF
/F
)
between
the
group
of
F
-automorphisms
of
X
and
the
group
of
F
-automorphisms
of
XF
.
This
assumption
on
X
implies
that
we
have
a
natural
isomorphism
∼
Aut(X)
×Gal(F/F
mod
)
Gal(F
/F
mod
)
→
Aut(XF
)
[induced
by
the
ﬁber
product

and
hence
that
the
natural
exact
sequence

a

the

to

Note
that
by
the
functoriality
of
the
algorithms
of
Theorem
1.9,
it
fol∼
lows
that
there
is
a
natural

Aut(X)

that
is
compatible
with
the
natural

Aut(X)


∼

Out(GF
)
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk15],
Theorem
3.1],
Out(ΠX

);
in
particular,
one
may
functorially
construct
the

Next,

(∼

constructed
in
Theorem

[cf.

denote

we

[where

the

one
may

Note
that

uniquely
determined
by
the

stated.
Indeed,

non
this
follows
by
considering
the
stabilizers
in

of
elements

with
the
well-known
fact
that
a

Moreover,

Indeed,
by
Corollary

(i)
[cf.

this

from
the

By



M

Thus,

to

the

we
obtain
a

on
the
portion

a

constituted
by
this
local

Moreover,
by
composing
this

In

Note

Here,
we

Observe
that

formed

obtained

preserved

Remark
5.4.1.
Note
that
the
diagrams
of
Deﬁnition
5.4,
(iii),
(v),
[hence
also
the
natural
transformations
of
Deﬁnition
5.4,
(vii)]
cannot
be
extended
to
global
number
ﬁelds!
Indeed,
this
observation
is,
in
essence,
a
reﬂection
of
the
fact
that
the
various
logarithms
that
may
be
deﬁned
at
the
various
completions
of
a
number
ﬁeld
do
not
induce
maps
from,
say,
the
group
of
units
of
the
number
ﬁeld
to
the
number
ﬁeld!
Remark
5.4.2.
Note
that
in
the
context
of
Deﬁnition
5.4,
(iii),
when
k
is
not
absolutely
unramiﬁed,
the
“gap”
between
OkΠ∼k
and
I
may
be
bounded
in
terms
of
the
ramiﬁcation
index
of
k
over
Qpk
.
We
leave
the
routine
details
to
the
interested
reader.
Remark
5.4.3.
The
inclusions
“OkΠ∼k
⊆
I”,
“Ok∼
⊆
I”
of
Deﬁnition
5.4,
(iii),
(v),
may
be
thought
of
as
inclusions,
within
the
log-shell
I,
of
the
various
localizations
of
the
trivial
-line
bundle
of
Deﬁnition
5.3,
(ii)
—
an
-line
bundle
whose
structure
is
determined
by
the
global
ring
of
integers
[i.e.,
“OM

”
in
the
notation
of
Deﬁnition
5.3,
(ii)],
equipped
its
natural
metrics
at
the
archimedean
primes.
That
is
to
say,
the
deﬁnition
of
the
trivial
-line
bundle
involves,
in
an
essential
way,
not
just
the
additive
[i.e.,
“”]
structure
of
the
global
ring
of
integers,
but
also
the
multiplicative
[i.e.,
“”]
structure
of
the
global
ring
of
integers.

of

3.6,

to
the
reader.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iv).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(v).
The
fact
that

is
a
nexus
of
Γ•D
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions.
When
•
=
,
the
total
-rigidity
of
D•
follows
immediately
∼

from
the
equivalence
of
categories
Th
T
→
EA
of
Corollary
5.2,
(iv),
together
with
the
slimness
of
the
proﬁnite
groups
that
appear
as
objects
of
EA
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk20],
Proposition
2.3,
(ii)].
When
•
=
,
the
total
-rigidity
of
D•
follows,
in
light
of
the
“Kummer
theory”
of
Propositions
3.2,
(iv);
4.2,
(i),
from
the
fact
that
the
orbi-objects
that
appear
in
the
deﬁnition
of
a
panalocal
Galois-theater
are
deﬁned
in
such
a
way
as
to
eliminate
all
the
automorphisms
[cf.
Deﬁnition
5.1,
(iv),
(b),
(c)].
The
remainder
of
assertion
(v)
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions
and
constructions
made
thus
far.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(v).
Finally,
we
observe
that
assertion
(vi)
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions
and
constructions
made
thus
far.
Remark
5.5.1.
The
“general
formal
content”
of
the
remarks
following
Corollaries
3.6,
3.7
applies
to
the
situation
discussed
in
Corollary
5.5,
as
well.
We
leave
the
routine
details
of
translating
these
remarks
into
the
language
of
the
situation
of
Corollary
5.5
to
the
interested
reader.
Remark
5.5.2.
Note
that
it
does
not
appear
realistic
to
attempt
to
construct
a
theory
of
“geometric
panalocalization”
with
respect
to
the
various
closed
points
of
the
hyperbolic
orbicurve
over
an
MLF
under
consideration
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remarks
1.11.5;
3.7.7,
(ii)].
Indeed,
the
decomposition
groups
of
such
closed
points
[which
are
either
isomorphic
to
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
an
MLF
or
an
extension

of
such
an
absolute
Galois
group
by
a
copy
of
Z(1)]
do
not
satisfy
an
appropriate
analogue
of
the
crucial
mono-anabelian
result
Corollary
1.10
[hence,
in
particular,
do
not
lead
to
a
situation
in
which
both
of
the
two
combinatorial
dimensions
of
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
an
MLF
under
consideration
are
rigidiﬁed
—
cf.
Remark
1.9.4].

Remark
5.6.1.
(i)
Observe
that
a
monoid
M
may
be
thought
of
as
a
[1-]category
CM
consisting
of
a
single
object
whose
monoid
of
endomorphisms
is
given
by
M
.
In
a
similar
vein,
a
ring
R,
whose
underlying
additive
group
we
denote
by
R
,
may
be
thought
of
as
a
2-category
consisting
of
the
single
1-category
CR
,
together
with
the
functors
CR
→
CR
arising
from
left
multiplication
by
elements
of
R.
(ii)
The
constructions
of
(i)
suggest
that
whereas
a
monoid
may
be
thought
of
as
a
mathematical
object
with
“one
combinatorial
dimension”,
a
ring
should
be
thought
of
as
a
mathematical
object
with
“two
combinatorial
dimensions”.
Moreover,
in
the
case
of
an
MLF
k,
these
two
combinatorial
dimensions
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
the
two
cohomological
dimensions
of
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
k,
while
in
the
case
of
a
CAF
k,
these
two
combinatorial
dimensions
may
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
the
two
real
or
topological
dimensions
of
k.
Thus,
from
this
point
of
view,
it
is
natural
to
think
of
ring
structures
as
corresponding
to
holomorphic
structures
—
i.e.,
both
ring
and
holomorphic
structures
are
based
on
a
certain
complicated
“intertwining
of
the
underlying
two
combinatorial
dimensions”.
So
far,
in
the
theory
of
§1,
§2,
§3,
and
§4
of
the
present
paper,
the
emphasis
has
been
on
“holomorphic
structures”,
i.e.,
of
restricting
ourselves
to
situations
in
which
this
“complicated
intertwining”
is
rigid.
By
contrast,
the
various
ideas
introduced
in
Deﬁnition
5.6
relate
to
the
issue
of
disabling
this
rigidity
—
i.e.,
of
“passing
from
one
holomorphic
to
two
underlying
combinatorial/topological
dimensions”
—
an
operation
which,
as
was
discussed
in
Remarks
1.9.4,
2.7.3,
has
the
eﬀect
of
leaving
only
one
of
the
two
combinatorial
dimensions
rigid.
Put
another
way,
this
corresponds
to
the
operation
of
“passing
from
rings
to
monoids”;
this
is
the
principal
motivation
for
the
term
“mono-analyticization”.
The
following
result
is
elementary
and
well-known.
Proposition
5.7.
(Local
Volumes)
Let
k
be
either
a
mixed-characteristic
nonarchimedean
local
ﬁeld
or
a
complex
archimedean
ﬁeld.
(i)
Suppose
that
k
is
nonarchimedean
[cf.
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(i)].
Write
mk
⊆
Ok
for
the
maximal
ideal
of
Ok
and
M(k)
for
the
set
of
compact
open
subsets
of

Then:
(a)
There
exists
a
unique
map

:
M(k)

that
satisﬁes
the
following
properties:
(1)
additivity,
i.e.,
μk
(A
B)
=
μk
(A)
+
μk
(B),
for
A,
B
∈
M(k)
such
that
A
B
=
∅;
(2)
-translation
invariance,
i.e.,
μk
(A
+
x)
=
μk
(A),
for
A
∈
M(k),
x
∈
k;
(3)
normalization,
i.e.,
μk
(Ok
)
=
1.
We
shall
refer
to
μk
(−)
as
the
volume
on
k.
def
Also,
we
shall
write
μlog
k
(−)
=
log(μk
(−))
[where
log
denotes
the
natural

R>0
→

and
refer
to

as

Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
Part
(a)
follows
immediately
from
wellknown
properties
of
the
Haar
measure
on
the
locally
compact
[additive]
group
k.
Part
(b)
follows
immediately
from
the
uniqueness
portion
of
part
(a).
To
verify
part
(c)
for
arbitrary
A,
it
suﬃces
[by
the
additivity
property
of
μk
(−)]
to
verify
part
(c)
for
A
of
the
form
x
+
mnk
for
n
a
suﬃciently
large
positive
integer,
x
∈
Ok×
.
∼
But
then
logk
determines
a
bijection
x
+
mnk
→
logk
(x)
+
mnk
,
so
the
equality
log
log
μlog
k
(A)
=
μk
(logk
(A))
follows
from
the
-translation
invariance
of
μk
(−).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
wellknown
properties
of
the
geometry
of
the
complex
plane.
Remark
5.7.1.
The
“log-compatibility”
[i.e.,
part
(c)]
of
Proposition
5.7,
(i),
(ii),
may
be
regarded
as
a
sort
of
“integrated
version”
of
the
fact
that
the
derivative
of
the
formal
power
series
log(1
+
X)
=
X
+
.
.
.
at
X
=
0
is
equal
to
1.
Moreover,
the
opposite
directions
of
the
“arrows
involved”
[i.e.,
logarithm
versus
exponential]
in
the
nonarchimedean
and
archimedean
cases
is
reminiscent
of
the
discussion
of
Remark
4.5.2.
Proposition
5.8.
(Mono-analytic
Reconstruction
of
Log-shells)
(i)
Let
Gk
be
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
an
MLF

Then
there

[cf.
[Mzk9],
Proposition
1.2.1,
(iii),
(iv)].
Here,
the
asserted
“functoriality”
is
contravariant
and
induced
by
the
Verlagerung,
or
transfer,
map
on
abelianizations.
In
particular,
we
obtain
a
functorial
“group-theoretic”
algorithm
for
reconstructing
the
residue
characteristic
p
[cf.
[Mzk9],
Proposition
1.2.1,
(i)],

Proof.
The
various
assertions
of
Proposition
5.8
are
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions
and
the
references
quoted
in
these
deﬁnitions.
Remark
5.8.1.
(i)
One
way
to
summarize
the
archimedean
portion
of
Proposition
5.8
is
as
follows:
Suppose
that
one
starts
with
the
[Aut-]holomorphic
monoid
given
by
an
isomorph
of
OC
[i.e.,
where
one
thinks
of
the
[Aut-]holomorphic
structure
on
OC
as

consisting
of
a(n)
[Aut-]holomorphic
structure
on
(OC
)gp
=
C×
]
arising
as
the
OA
X
for
some
X
∈
Ob(EA).
The
operation
of
mono-analyticization
consists
of
“forgetting
the
rigidiﬁcation
of
the
[Aut-]holomorphic
structure
furnished
by
X”
[cf.
Remark
2.7.3].
Thus,
applying
the
operation
of
mono-analyticization
to
an
isomorph
of
OC
yields
the
object
of
TM
consisting
of
an
isomorph
of
the
topological
monoid
OC
equipped
with
the
submonoid
corresponding
to
OC
∩
R>0
,
which
is
non-rigid,
in
the
sense
that
it
is
subject
to
dilations
[cf.
Remark
2.7.3].
On
the
other
hand:
From
the
point
of
view
of
the
theory
of
log-shells,
one
wishes
to
perform
the
operation
of
mono-analyticization
—
i.e.,
of
“forgetting
the
[Aut]holomorphic
structure”
—
in
such
a
way
that
one
does
not
obliterate
the
metric
rigidity
[i.e.,
the
“applicability”
of
the
theory
of
Proposition
5.7]
of
the
log-shells
involved.
This
is
precisely
what
is
achieved
by
the
use
of
the
category
TB
—
cf.,
especially,
hol
hol
→
CTB
in
Deﬁnition
5.6,
(iv);
the
the
construction
of
the
natural
functor
CTH
constructions
of
Proposition
5.8,
(iv),
(v),
(vi).
That
is
to
say,
the
“metric
rigidity”
of
log-shells
is
preserved
even
after
mono-analyticization
by
thinking
of
the
“metric
rigidity”
of
the
original
[Aut-]holomorphic
OC
as
being
constituted
by
“the
metric
rigidity
of
S1
∼
=
OC×
,
together
with
the
rotation
automorphisms
of
Lie(C×
)
of
order
4”
[cf.
Deﬁnition
5.6,
(iv)].
That
is
to
say,
this
approach
to
describing
“[Aut-]holomorphic
metric
rigidity”
has
the
advantange
of
being
“immune
to
mono-analyticization”
—
cf.
the
construction
of
k
∼
(G)
as
“C
∼
×
C
∼
”
in
Proposition
5.8,
(iv).
On
the
other
hand,
it
has
the
TOPICS
IN
ABSOLUTE
ANABELIAN
GEOMETRY
III
143
disadvantage
that
it
is
not
compatible
[as
one
might
expect
from
any
sort
of
monoanalyticization
operation!]
with
preserving
the
complex
archimedean
ﬁeld
structure
of
“k
∼
”.
That
is
to
say,
the
two
factors
of
C
∼
appearing
in
the
product
“C
∼
×
C
∼
”
—
which
should
correspond
to
the
imaginary
and
real
portions
of
such
a
complex
archimedean
ﬁeld
structure
—
may
only
be
related
to
one
another
up
to
a
{±1}
indeterminacy,
an
indeterminacy
that
has
the
eﬀect
of
obliterating
the
ring/ﬁeld
structure
involved.
(ii)
It
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
discussion
of
the
archimedean
situation
of
(i)
is
strongly
reminiscent
of
the
nonarchimedean
portion
of
Proposition
5.8,
which
allows
one
to
construct
metrically
rigid
log-shells
which
are
immune
to
mono-analyticization,
but
only
at
the
expense
of
sacriﬁcing
the
ring/ﬁeld
structures
involved.

we

then
we
obtain

where
the

Thus,

we
note
that

In

suppose

Then

Thus,
for

we

Moreover,
by

If

then
we

Proof.
The
various
assertions
of
Corollary
5.10
are
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions,
together
with
the
references
quoted
in
the
statement
of
Corollary
5.10.
Here,
we
note
that
in
the
nonarchimedean
portion
of
part
(c)
of
assertion
(iv),
in
order
to
construct
the
isomorphisms
ηv,ν
,
it
is
necessary
to
relate
the
construction
of
the
base
ﬁeld
as
a
subset
of
abelianizations
of
various
open
subgroups
of
the
Galois
group
[cf.
Proposition
5.8,
(i)]
to
the
Kummer-theoretic
construction
of
the
base
ﬁeld
as
performed
in
Theorem
1.9,
(e).
This
may
be
achieved
by
applying
the
group-theoretic
construction
algorithms
of
Corollary
1.10
—
i.e.,
more
precisely,
by
combining
the
“fundamental
class”
natural
isomorphism
of
Corollary
1.10,
(a)
[cf.
also
the
ﬁrst
isomorphism
of
the
display
of
Corollary
1.10,
(b)],
with
the
cyclotomic
natural
isomorphism
of
Corollary
1.10,
(c)
[cf.
also
Remark
1.10.3,
(ii)].
Put
another
way,
this
series
of
algorithms
may
be
summarized
as
a
“group-theoretic
algorithm
for
constructing
the
reciprocity
map
of
local
class
ﬁeld
theory”.
Remark
5.10.1.
(i)
Note
that,
in
the
notation
of
Corollary
5.10,
(iv),
(c),
by
pre-composing
ηv,ν
with
the
telecore
arrow
φ
:
An•
[X
]
→
X
of
Corollary
5.5,
(ii),
and
applying
the
coricity
of
Corollary
5.5,
(i),
together
with
an
appropriate
mono-analyticization
homotopy,
we
obtain
that
one
may
think
of
ηv,ν
as
yielding
a
homotopy
from
the

path
φAn
v,ν
•
An
[X
]
−→
An
[N
]
−→
Nv
—
which
is
somewhat
simpler
[hence
perhaps
easier
to
grasp
intuitively]
than
the
domain
path
of
the
original
homotopy
ηv,ν
—
to
the
path
•
An
[X

φ
−→
X

v,ν
−→
Nv
−→
Nv
0
[i.e.,
obtained
by
simply
pre-composing
γv,ν
with
φ
].
(ii)
Note
that
the
isomorphism
of
(i)
between
the
two
composites
of
functors
An
[X
]
→
Nv
depends
only
on
“Galois-theoretic/Aut-holomorphic
data”.
In
particular,
one
may
construct
—
in
the
style
of
Remarks
5.3.1,
5.9.1
—
a
category
“An•
[X
,
η
]”
whose
objects
consist
of
the
data
of
objects
of
An•
[X
],
together
with
the
algorithms
used
to
construct
the
various
homotopies
of
(i)
arising
from
ηv,ν
[i.e.,
associated
to
the
various
v
∈
V(F
mod
),
ν
∈
Γ×
v
],
and
whose
morphisms
are
the
•
morphisms
induced
by
morphisms
of
An
[X
].
That
is
to
say,
objects
of
An•
[X
,
η
]
consist
of
objects
of
An•
[X
],
together
with
“group-theoretic
algorithms
encoding
the
reciprocity
law
of
local
class
ﬁeld
theory
at
the
nonarchimedean
primes
and
the
archimedean
analogue
of
these
algorithms
at
the
archimedean
primes”.
Moreover,
the
“forgetful
functor”
∼
An•
[X
,
η
]
→
An•
[X
]
•
determines
a
natural
equivalence
of
categories.
Finally,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
one
may
replace
“An•
[X
]”
by
“An•
[X
,
η
]”
in
Corollaries
5.5
and
5.10
without
aﬀecting
the
validity
of
their
content
—
e.g.,
without
aﬀecting
the
coricity
of
Corollary
5.5,
(i).
We
leave
the
routine
details
to
the
interested
reader.
Remark
5.10.2.
The
signiﬁcance
of
the
theory
of
log-shells
as
summarized
in
Corollary
5.10
—
and,
more
generally,
of

entire
theory
of
the
present
paper
—
may
be
understood
in
more
intuitive
terms
as
follows.

(i)
One
important
aspect
of
the
classical
theory
of
line
bundles
on
a
proper
curve
[over
a
ﬁeld]
is
that
although
such
line
bundles
exhibit
a
certain
rigidity
arising
from
the
properness
of
the
curve,
this
rigidity
is
obliterated
by
Zariski
localization
on
the
curve.
Put
another
way,
to
work
with
line
bundles
up
to
isomorphism
amounts
to
allowing
oneself
to
“multiply
the
line
bundle
by
a
rational
function”,
i.e.,
to
work
up
to
rational
equivalence.
Although
rational
equivalence
does
not
obliterate
the
global
degree
of
a
line
bundle
over
the
entire
proper
curve,
if
one
thinks
of
a
line
bundle
as
a
collection
of
integral
structures
at
the
various
primes
of
the
curve,
then
rational
equivalence
has
the
eﬀect
of
“rearranging
these
integral
structures”
at
the
various
primes.

If
one
restricts
oneself
to
working
globally
on
the
proper
curve,
then
such
“rearrangements”
are
coordinated
with
one
another
in
such
a
way
as
to
preserve,
for
instance,
the
global
degree;
on
the
other
hand,
if
one
further
imposes
the
condition
of
compatibility
with
Zariski
localization,
then
such
“coordination
of
integral
structure”
mechanisms
are
obliterated.
By
contrast,
the
“MF
∇
-objects”
of
[Falt]
satisfy
a
certain
“extraordinary
rigidity”
with
respect
to
Zariski
localization
that
reﬂects
the
fact
that
they
form
a
category
that
is
equivalent
to
a
certain
category
of
Galois
representations.
From
the
point
of
view
of
thinking
of
line
bundles
as
collections
of
integral
structures
at
the
various
primes,
the
rigidity
of
MF
∇
-objects
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“freezing
of
the
integral
structures”
at
the
various
primes
in
a
fashion
that
is
immune
to
the
gluing
indeterminacies
that
occur
for
line
bundles
upon
execution
of
Zariski
localization
operations.
Put
another
way,
this
rigidity
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“immunity
to
social
isolation”
from
other
primes.
In
the
context
of
Corollary
5.10,
this
property
corresponds
to
the
panalocalizability
[i.e.,
Corollary
5.10,
(iii)]
of
[the
integral
structures
constituted
by]
log-shells.

(ii)
At
this
point,
it
is
useful
to
observe
that,
at
least
from
an
a
priori
point
of
view,
there
exist
other
ways
in
which
one
might
attempt
to
“freeze
the
local
integral
structures”.
For
instance,
instead
of
working
strictly
with
line
bundles,
one
could
consider
the
ring
structure
of
the
global
ring
of
integers
of
a
number
ﬁeld
[which
gives
rise
to
the
trivial
line
bundle
—
cf.
Deﬁnition
5.3,
(ii)];
that
is
to
say,
by
considering
ring
structures,
one
obtains
a
“rigid
integral
structure”
that
is
compatible
with
Zariski
localization
—
i.e.,
by
considering
the
ring
structure
“O”
of
the
local
rings
of
integers
[cf.
Remark
5.4.3].
Indeed,
log-shells
may
be
thought
of
—
and,
moreover,
were
originally
intended
by
the
author
—
as
a
sort
of
approximation
of
these
local
integral
structures
“O”
[cf.
Remark
5.4.2].
On
the
other
hand,
this
sort
of
rigidiﬁcation
of
local
integral
structures
that
makes
essential
use
of
the
ring
structure
is
no
longer
compatible
with
the
operation
of
mono-analyticization
[cf.
Remark
5.6.1],
i.e.,
of
forgetting
one
of
the
two
combinatorial
dimensions
“”,
“”
that
constitute
the
ring
structure.
Thus,
another
crucial
property
of
log-shells
is
their
compatibility
with
mono-analyticization,
as
documented
in
Corollary
5.10,
(iv)
[cf.
also
Remarks
5.8.1,
5.9.2;
Deﬁnition
5.9,
(iii)],
i.e.,
their
“immunity
to
social
isolation”
from
the
given
ring
structures.
From
the
point
of
view
of
the
theory
of
§1,
§2,
§3,
§4,
such
ring
structures
may
be
thought
of
as
“arithmetic
holomorphic
structures”
[i.e.,
outer
Galois
actions
at
nonarchimedean
primes
and
Aut-holomorphic
structures
at
archimedean
primes]
—
cf.
Remark
5.6.1.
Thus,
if
one
thinks
of
the
result
of
forgetting
such
“arithmetic
holomorphic
structures”
as
being
like
a
sort
of
“arithmetic
real
analytic
core”
on
which
various
“arithmetic
holomorphic
structures”
may
be
imposed
—
i.e.,
a
sort
of
arithmetic
analogue
of
the
underlying
real
analytic
surface
of
a
Riemann
surface,
on
which
various
holomorphic
structures
may
be
imposed
[cf.
Remark
5.10.3
below]
—
then
the
theory
of
mono-analyticization
of
log-shells
guarantees
that
log-shells
remain
meaningful
even
as
one
travels
back
and
forth
between
various
“zones
of
arithmetic
holomorphy”
joined
—
in
a
fashion
reminiscent
of
spokes
emanating
from
a
core
—
by
a
single
“mono-analytic
core”.

SHINICHI

(iii)
Another
approach
to
constructing
“mono-analytic
rigid
local
integral
structures”
is
to
work
with
the
local
monoids
“O
”
[i.e.,
as
opposed
to
“log(O×
)”,
as
was
done
in
the
case
of
log-shells].
Here,
“O
”
may
be
thought
of
as
a
[possibly
twisted]
product
of
“O×
”
with
some
“valuation
monoid”
that
consists
of
a
submonoid
of
R≥0
.
For
instance,
in
the
[complex]
archimedean
case,
OC
∼
=
OC×
×
R>0
.
On
the
other
hand
[cf.
Remark
5.6.1],
the
dimension
constituted
by
the
“valuation
monoid”
R>0
fails
to
retain
its
rigidity
when
subjected
to
the
operation
of
mono-analyticization.
The
resulting
“dilations”
of
R>0
[i.e.,
by
raising
to
the
λth
power,
for
λ
∈
R>0
]
may
be
thought
of
as
being
like
Teichmüller
dilations
of
the
mono-analytic
core
discussed
in
(ii)
above
[cf.
also
the
discussion
of
Remark
5.10.3
below].
If,
moreover,
one
is
to
retain
a
coherent
theory
of
global
degrees
of
arithmetic
line
bundles
in
the
presence
of
such
“arithmetic
Teichmüller
dilations”,
then
[in
order
to
preserve
the
“product
formula”
of
elementary
number
theory]
it
is
necessary
to
subject
the
valuation
monoids
at
nonarchimedean
primes
to
“arithmetic
Teichmüller
dilations”
which
are
“synchronized”
with
the
dilations
that
occur
at
the
archimedean
primes.
From
the
point
of
the
theory
of
Frobenioids
of
[Mzk16],
[Mzk17],
such
“arithmetic
Teichmüller
dilations”
at
nonarchimedean
primes
are
given
by
the
unit-linear
Frobenius
functor
studied
in
[Mzk16],
Proposition
2.5.
Thus,
in
summary:
In
order
to
guarantee
the
rigidity
of
the
local
integral
structures
under
consideration
when
subject
to
mono-analyticization,
one
must
abandon
the
“valuation
monoid”
portion
of
“O
”,
i.e.,
one
is
obliged
to
restrict
one’s
attention
to
the
“O×
”
portion
of
“O
”.
On
the
other
hand,
within
each
zone
of
arithmetic
holomorphy
[cf.
(ii)],
one
wishes
to
consider
various
diverse
modiﬁcations
of
integral
structure
on
the
“rigid
standard
integral
structures”
that
one
constructs.
Since
this
is
not
possible
if
one
restricts
oneself
to
“O×
”
regarded
multiplicatively,
one
is
thus
led
to
working
with
“log(O×
)”
—
i.e.,
in
eﬀect
with
the
log-shells
discussed
in
Corollary
5.10.
Thus,
within
each
zone
of
arithmetic
holomorphy,
one
wishes
to
convert
the
“”
operation
of
“O×
”
into
a
“”
operation,
i.e.,
by
applying
the
logarithm.
On
the
other
hand,
when
one
leaves
that
zone
of
arithmetic
holomorphy,
one
wishes
to
return
again
to
working
with
“O×
”
multiplicatively,
so
as
to
achieve
compatibility
with
the
operation
of
mono-analyticization.
Here,
we
note
that
-line
bundles
—
i.e.,
in
other
words,
line
bundles
regarded
from
an
idèlic
point
of
view
—
have
the
virtue
of
being
deﬁned
using
only
the
multiplicative
structure
of
the
rings
involved
[cf.
the
theory
of
Frobenioids
of
[Mzk16],
[Mzk17]],
hence
of
being
compatible
with
mono-analyticization.
[We
remark
here
that
the
detailed
speciﬁcation
of
precisely
which
monoids
we
wish
to
use
when
we
apply
the
theory
of
Frobenioids
is
beyond
the
scope
of
the
present
paper.]
By
contrast,
although
-line
bundles
—
i.e.,
line
bundes
regarded
as
modules
of
a
certain
type
—
are
not
compatible
with
mono-analyticization,
they
have
the
virtue
of
allowing
us
to
relate,
within
each
zone
of
arithmetic
holomorphy,
the
additive
module
“log(O×
)”
to
the
theory
of
-line
bundles
[which
is
compatible
with
mono-analyticization].
Thus,
in
summary:
This
state
of
aﬀairs
obliges
one
to
work
in
a
“framework”
in
which
one
may
pass
freely,
within
each
zone
of
arithmetic
holomorphy,
back
and
forth
between
“”
and
“”
via
application
of
the
logarithm
at
the
various
nonarchimedean
and
archimedean
primes.

On
the
other
hand,
since
the
logarithm
is
not
a
ring
homomorphism,
it
is
not
at
all
clear,
a
priori,
how
to
establish
a
framework
in
which
one
may
apply
the
logarithm
at
will
[within
each
zone
of
arithmetic
holomorphy],
without
obliterating
the
foundations
[e.g.,
scheme-theoretic!]
underlying
the
mathematical
objects
that
one
works
with,
and,
moreover,
[a
related
issue
—
cf.
Remark
5.4.1]
without
obliterating
the
crucial
global
structure
of
the
number
ﬁelds
involved
[which
is
necessary
to
make
sense
of
global
arithmetic
line
bundles!].
A
solution
to
this
problem
of
ﬁnding
an
appropriate
“framework”
as
discussed
above
is
precisely
what
is
provided
by
“Galois
theory”
[cf.
also
the
“log-invariant
log-volumes”
of
Corollary
5.10,
(i),
(ii)]
—
which
is
both
global
and
“log-invariant”;
the
suﬃciency
of
this
“framework”
[from
the
point
of
view
of
carrying
out
various
arithmetic
operations
involving
line
bundles,
as
discussed
above]
is
precisely
what
is
guaranteed
by
the

and

[i.e.,
over

of

Note
that
in
order
to
work
with
-line

[cf.
the

it
is
necessary
[unlike
the
case
with
-line
bundles]
to
work
with
all
the
primes
of
a
number
ﬁeld.
Indeed,
to
work
with
“line
bundles”
in
a
fashion
that
allows
one
to
ignore
some
nonempty
set
of
primes
of
the
number
ﬁeld
amounts
to
working
with
a
notion
of
rational
equivalence
that
involves
some
proper
subgroup
of
the
multiplicative
group
F
×
associated
to
the
number

F
.
On
the
other,
the
only
subgroups
of
F

that
[if
one
considers
the
union
of
F

with
{0}]
are
closed
under
addition
are
the
subgroups
of
F

that
arise
from
subﬁelds
of

i.e.,
which
correspond,
in

to

The

concerning
the

of

Finally,
we
recall
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
discussion
of
telecores
in
the
remarks
following
Corollaries
3.6,
3.7,
the
various
“forgetful
functors”
of
assertion
(ii)
of
Corollaries
3.6,
4.5,
5.5
may
be
thought
of
as
being
analogous
to
passing
to
the
“underlying
vector
bundle
plus
Hodge
ﬁltration”
of
an
MF
∇
-object
[cf.
Remark
3.7.2].
From
this
point
of
view:
Log-shells
may
be
thought
of,
in
the
context
of
this
analogy
with
MF
∇
objects,
as
corresponding
to
the
section
of
a
[projective]
nilpotent
admissible
indigenous
bundle
in
positive
characteristic
determined
by
the
p-curvature
[i.e.,
in
other
words,
the
Frobenius
conjugate
of
the
Hodge
ﬁltration].
Remark
5.10.3.
From
the
point
of
the
view
of
the
analogy
of
the
theory
of
monoanabelian
log-compatibility
[cf.
§3,
§4]
with
the
theory
of
uniformizing
MF
∇
-objects
[cf.
Remark
3.7.2],
the
global/panalocal/mono-analytic
theory
of
log-shells
presented
in
the
present
§5
may
be
understood
as
follows.
(i)
The
mathematical
apparatus
on
a
number
ﬁeld
arising
from
the
global/panalocal
mono-anabelian
log-compatibility
of
Corollary
5.5
may
be
thought
of
as
being
analogous
to
the
[mod
p]
MF
∇
-object
constituted
by
a
nilpotent
indigenous
bundle
on
a
hyperbolic
curve
in
positive
characteristic
[cf.
the
theory
of
[Mzk1],
[Mzk4]].
Note
that
this
mathematical
apparatus
on
a
number
ﬁeld
arises,
essentially,
from
the
outer
Galois
representation
determined
by
a
once-punctured
elliptic
curve
over
the
number
ﬁeld.
That
is
to
say,
roughly
speaking,
we
have
correspondences
as
follows:
number
ﬁeld
F
once-punctured
ell.
curve
X
over
F
←→
hyperbolic
curve
C
in
pos.
char.
←→
nilp.
indig.
bundle
P
over
C.
Here,
we
note
that
the
correspondence
between
number
ﬁelds
and
curves
over
ﬁnite
ﬁelds
is
quite
classical;
the
correspondence
between
families
of
elliptic
curves
and
indigenous
bundles
is
natural
in
the
sense
that
the
most
fundamental
example
of
an
indigenous
bundle
is
given
by
the
projectivization
of
the
ﬁrst
de
Rham
cohomology
module
of
the
tautological
family
of
elliptic
curves
over
the
moduli
stack
of
elliptic
curves.
Note,
moreover,
that:
Just
as
in
the
case
of
indigenous
bundles,
the
fact
that
the
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
is
an
isomorphism
may
be
interpreted
as
asserting
that
the
base
curve
“entrusts
its
local
moduli
to
the
indigenous
bundle”,
in
the
mono-anabelian
theory
of
the
present
paper,
the
various
localizations
of
a
number
ﬁeld
“entrust
their
ring
structures
to
the
mono-anabelian
data
determined
by
the
once-punctured
elliptic
curve”
[cf.
Remarks
1.9.4,
2.7.3,
5.6.1;
Remark
5.10.2,
(iii)].
Relative
to
this
analogy,
we
observe
that
panalocalizability
corresponds
to
the
local
rigidity
of
MF
∇
-objects
[cf.
Remark
5.10.2,
(i)].
Moreover,
the
operation
of
monoanalyticization
—
i.e.,
“forgetting
the
once-punctured
elliptic
curve”
—
corresponds
to
forgetting
the
indigenous
bundle,
hence
to
relinquishing
control
of
the
local
moduli
of
the
base
curve
C;
thus,
just
as
this
led
to
“Teichmüller
dilations”
in
the
discussion
of
Remark
5.10.2,
(ii),
(iii),
in
the
theory
of
indigenous
bundles,
forgetting
the
TOPICS
IN
ABSOLUTE
ANABELIAN
GEOMETRY
III
155
indigenous
bundle
means,
in
particular,
loss
of
control
of
the
deformation
moduli
of
the
base
curve
C.
Another
noteworthy
aspect
of
this
analogy
may
be
seen
in
the
fact
that:
Just
as
the
log-Frobenius
operation
only
exists
for
local
ﬁelds
[cf.
Remark
5.4.1],
in
the
theory
of
indigenous
bundles,
Frobenius
liftings
only
exist
Zariski
locally
on
the
base
curve
C.
On
the
other
hand,
unlike
the
“linear
algebra-theoretic”
nature
of
the
theory
of
indigenous
bundles
[which
may
be
thought
of
as
sl2
-bundles],
the
outer
Galois
representations
that
appear
in
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
are
fundamentally
“anabelian”
in
nature
—
i.e.,
their
“non-abelian
nature”
is
not
limited
to
a
relatively
weak
“linear
algebra-theoretic”
departure
from
abelianity,
but
rather
on
a
par
with
that
of
[proﬁnite]
free
groups.
In
particular,
unlike
the
linear
algebratheoretic
[i.e.,
“sl2
-theoretic”]
nature
of
the
intertwining
of
the
two
dimensions
of
an
indigenous
vector
bundle,
the
two
combinatorial
dimensions
involved
[cf.
Remark
5.6.1]
are
intertwined
in
an
essentially
anabelian
fashion
[i.e.,
constitute
a
sort
of
“noncommutative
plane”].
(ii)
Once
one
has
the
“rigid
standard
integral
structures”
constituted
by
logshells
[cf.
Remark
5.10.2,
(iii)],
it
is
natural
to
consider
modifying
these
integral
structures
by
means
of
the
“Gaussian
zeroes”
[i.e.,
the
inverse
of
the
“Gaussian
poles”]
that
appear
in
the
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
of
elliptic
curves
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk6],
§1.1].
From
the
point
of
view
of
this
theory,
this
amounts,
in
eﬀect,
to
considering
the
“crystalline
theta
object”
[cf.
[Mzk7],
§2].
That
is
to
say,
the
mathematical
apparatus
developed
in
the
present
§5
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
preparatory
step,
relative
to
the
goal
of
constructing
a
“global
MF
∇
-objecttype
version
of
the
crystalline
theta
object”.
This
point
of
view
is
in
line
with
the
point
of
view
of
the
Introduction
to
[Mzk18]
[cf.
also
[Mzk18],
Remark
5.10.2],
together
with
the
fact
that
the
theory
of
the
étale
theta
function
given
in
[Mzk18],
§1,
involves,
in
an
essential
way,
the
theory
of
elliptic
cuspidalizations
[cf.
Remark
2.7.2].
Moreover,
this
point
of
view
is
reminiscent
of
the
discussion
in
[Mzk7],
§2,
of
the
relation
of
crystalline
theta
objects
to
MF
∇
-objects
—
that
is
to
say,
the
crystalline
theta
object
has
many
properties
that
are
similar
to
those
of
an
MF
∇
object,
with
the
notable
exception
constituted
by
the
vanishing
of
the
higher
pcurvatures
despite
the
fact
that
the
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
is
an
isomorphism
[cf.
[Mzk7],
Remark
2.11].
This
vanishing
of
higher
p-curvatures,
when
viewed
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
theory
of
“VF-patterns”
of
indigenous
bundles
in
[Mzk4],
seems
to
suggest
that,
whereas
the
indigenous
bundles
considered
in
the
p-adic
uniformization
theory
of
[Mzk4]
are
of
“ﬁnite
Frobenius
period”
[in
the
sense
that
they
are
ﬁxed,
up
to
isomorphism,
by
some
ﬁnite
number
of
applications
of
Frobenius],
the
crystalline
theta
object
may
only
be
equipped
with
an
“MF
∇
object
structure”
if
one
allows
for
inﬁnite
Frobenius
periods.
On
the
other
hand,
by
comparison
to
the
Frobenius
morphisms
that
appear
in
the
theory
of
[Mzk4],
the
log-Frobenius
operation
log
certainly
has
the
feel
of
an
operation
of
“inﬁnite
order”.
Moreover,
as
discussed
in
Remark
3.6.5,
the
telecoricity
of
the
mathematical
apparatus
of
Corollary
5.5
may
be
regarded
as
being
analogous
to
nilpotent,
but
non-vanishing
p-curvature.
That
is
to
say:
By
considering
the
crystalline
theta
object
not
in
the
scheme-theoretic
framework
of
[scheme-theoretic!]
Hodge-Arakelov
theory,
but
rather
in
156
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
the
mono-anabelian
framework
of
the
present
paper,
one
obtains
a
theory
in
which
the
“contradiction”
[from
the
point
of
view
of
the
classical
theory
of
MF
∇
-objects]
of
“vanishing
higher
p-curvatures
in
the
presence
of
a
Kodaira-Spencer
isomorphism”
is
naturally
resolved.
The
above
discussion
suggests
that
one
may
reﬁne
the
correspondence
between
“once-punctured
elliptic
curves”
and
“indigenous
bundles”
discussed
in
(i)
as
follows:
crystalline
theta
objects
in
scheme-theoretic
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
the
theory
of
mono-anabelian
log-Frobenius
compatibility
of
the
present
paper
—
i.e.,
in
essence,
Belyi
cuspidalization
←→
the
scheme-theoretic
aspects
of
indigenous
bundles
[cf.
[Mzk1],
Chapter
I]
←→
the
positive
characteristic
Frobenius-theoretic
aspects
of
indigenous
bundles
—
e.g.,
the
Verschiebung
on
ind.
buns.
[cf.
[Mzk1],
Chapter
II]
Note
that
the
mono-anabelian
theory
of
the
present
paper
depends,
in
an
essential
way,
on
the
technique
of
Belyi
cuspidalization
[cf.
§1].
Since
the
technique
of
elliptic
cuspidalization
[cf.,
e.g.,
the
theory
of
[Mzk18],
§1!]
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
simpliﬁed,
linearized
[cf.
(v)
below]
version
of
the
technique
of
Belyi
cuspidalization,
and
the
Frobenius
action
on
square
diﬀerentials
in
the
theory
of
[Mzk1],
Chapter
II,
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
derivative
[i.e.,
a
sort
of
“simpliﬁed,
linearized
version”]
of
the
Verschiebung
on
indigenous
bundles,
it
is
natural
to
supplement
the
correspondences
given
above
with
the
following
further
correspondence:
the
theory
of
the
étale
theta
function
given
in
[Mzk18]
—
i.e.,
in
essence,
elliptic
cuspidalization
the
Frobenius
action
on
the
linear
space
of
square
diﬀerentials
[cf.
[Mzk1],
Chapter
II]
←→
These
analogies
with
the
theory
of
[Mzk1],
Chapter
II,
suggest
the
following
further
possible
correspondences:
?
hyp.
orbicurves
of
strictly
Belyi
type
←→
nilp.
admissible
ind.
buns.
elliptically
admissible
hyp.
orbicurves
←→
?
nilp.
ordinary
ind.
buns.
[i.e.,
where
all
of
the
hyperbolic
orbicurves
involved
are
deﬁned
over
number
ﬁelds
—
cf.
Remark
2.8.3].
At
any
rate,
the
correspondence
with
the
theory
of
Chapters
I,
II
of
[Mzk1]
suggests
strongly
the
existence
of
a
theory
of
canonical
liftings
for
number
ﬁelds
equipped
with
a
once-punctured
elliptic
curve
that
is
analogous
to
the
theory
of
Chapter
III
of
[Mzk1].
The
author
hopes
to
develop
such
a
theory
in
a
future
paper.
(iii)
Relative
to
the
discussion
of
“units”
versus
“valuation
monoids”
in
Remark
5.10.2,
(iii),
the
fact
that
the
logarithm
[i.e.,
log-Frobenius]
has
the
eﬀect
of
TOPICS
IN
ABSOLUTE
ANABELIAN
GEOMETRY
III
157
converting
[a
certain
portion
of]
the
“units”
into
a
“new
log-generation
valuation
monoid”
is
very
much
in
line
with
the
“positive
slope”
—
i.e.,
“telecore-theoretic”
—
nature
of
a
uniformizing
MF
∇
-object
[cf.
the
discussion
of
(i),
(ii)].
Indeed,
from
the
point
of
view
of
uniformizations
of
a
Tate
curve
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
2.7.2;
the
discussion
of
the
Introduction
of
[Mzk18]]
the
valuation
monoid
portion
of
an
MLF
corresponds
precisely
to
“slope
zero”,
whereas
the
units
of
an
MLF
correspond
to
“positive
slope”;
a
similar
such
correspondence
also
appears
in
classical
formulations
of
local
class
ﬁeld
theory.
(iv)
One
important
aspect
of
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
is
that
it
is
only
applicable
to
elliptically
admissible
hyperbolic
orbicurves,
i.e.,
hyperbolic
orbicurves
that
are
closely
related
to
a
once-punctured
elliptic
curve.
In
light
of
the
“entrusting
of
local
moduli/ring
structure”
aspect
of
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
discussed
in
(i)
above,
it
seems
reasonable
to
suspect
that
this
special
nature
of
once-punctured
elliptic
curves
[i.e.,
relative
to
the
theory
of
the
present
paper]
may
be
closely
related
to
the
fact
that,
unlike
arbitrary
hyperbolic
orbicurves,
the
moduli
stack
of
once-punctured
elliptic
curves
has
precisely
one
[holomorphic]
dimension
[i.e.,
corresponding
to
the
“one
holomorphic
dimension”
of
a
number
ﬁeld].
This
“special
nature
of
once-punctured
elliptic
curves”
is
also
reminiscent
of
the
observation
made
in
[Mzk6],
§1.5.2,
to
the
eﬀect
that
it
does
not
appear
possible
[at
least
in
any
immediate
way]
to
generalize
the
scheme-theoretic
HodgeArakelov
theory
of
elliptic
curves
either
to
higher-dimensional
abelian
varieties
or
to
higher
genus
curves.
Moreover,
it
is
reminiscent
of
the
parallelogram-theoretic
reconstruction
algorithms
of
Corollary
2.7,
which,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
theory
of
[Mzk14],
§2,
may
only
be
performed
canonically
once
one
chooses
some
ﬁxed
“one-dimensional
space
of
square
diﬀerentials”
—
a
choice
which
is
not
necessary
in
the
elliptically
admissible
case,
precisely
because
of
the
one-dimensionality
of
the
moduli
of
once-punctured
elliptic
curves.
(v)
Observe
that
the
“arithmetic
Teichmüller
dilations”
discussed
in
Remark
5.10.2,
(iii)
—
which
deform
the
“arithmetic
holomorphic
structure”
—
are
linear
in
nature
[cf.,
e.g.,
the
“unit-linear
Frobenius
functor”].
On
the
other
hand,
the
logFrobenius
operation
within
each
“zone
of
arithmetic
holomorphy”
is
“non-linear”,
with
respect
to
both
the
additive
and
multiplicative
structures
of
the
rings
involved.
Indeed,
as
discussed
extensively
in
the
remarks
following
Corollaries
3.6,
3.7
[cf.
also
the
discussion
in
the
latter
half
of
Remark
5.10.2,
(iii)],
the
essential
reason
for
the
introduction
of
mono-anabelian
geometry
in
the
present
paper
is
precisely
the
need
to
deal
with
this
non-linearity.
In
the
classical
theory
of
Teichmüller
deformations
of
Riemann
surfaces,
the
deformations
of
holomorphic
structure
are
linear
[cf.
the
approach
to
this
theory
given
in
[Mzk14],
§2].
On
the
other
hand,
non-linearity
may
be
witnessed
in
classical
Teichmüller
theory
in
the
quadratic
nature
of
the
square
diﬀerentials.
Typically,
non-linearity
is
related
to
some
sort
of
“bounded
domain”.
In
the
complex
theory,
the
bounded
nature
of
the
upper
half-plane,
as
well
as
of
Teichmüller
space
itself,
constitute
examples
of
this
phenomenon
—
cf.
the
discussion
of
“Frobenius-invariant
integral
structures”
in
[Mzk4],
Introduction,
§0.4.
In
the
case
of
elliptic
curves,
the
quadratic
nature
of
the
square
diﬀerentials
corresponds
precisely
to
the
quadratic
nature
of
the
exponent
that
appears
in
the
classical
series
representation
of
the
theta
function;
moreover,
this
quadratic
correspondence
“Z
n
→
n2
∈
Z”
is
[unlike
the
linear
correspondence
n
→
c
·
n,
for
c
∈
Z]
bounded
from
below.
Returning
to
the
theory
of
log-shells,
let
us
recall
158
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
that
the
non-linear
log-Frobenius
operation
is
used
precisely
to
achieve
the
crucial
boundedness
[i.e.,
“compactness”]
property
of
log-shells
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
5.10.2!].
Also,
relative
to
the
discussion
of
(ii)
above,
let
us
recall
that
the
goal
of
constructing
a
comparison
isomorphism
between
non-linear
compact
domains
of
function
spaces
formed
one
of
the
key
motivations
for
the
development
of
the
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
of
elliptic
curves
[cf.
[Mzk6],
§1.3.2,
§1.3.3].
(vi)
Relative
to
the
analogy
between
“once-punctured
elliptic
curves
over
number
ﬁelds”
and
“nilpotent
indigenous
bundles”
[cf.
(i)],
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
if
one
thinks
of
the
number
ﬁelds
involved
as
“log
number
ﬁelds”
—
i.e.,
number
ﬁelds
equipped
with
a
ﬁnite
set
of
primes
at
which
the
elliptic
curve
is
allowed
to
have
bad
[but
multiplicative!]
reduction
—
then
Siegel’s
classical
ﬁniteness
theorem
[which
implies
the
ﬁniteness
of
the
set
of
isomorphism
classes
of
elliptic
curves
over
a
given
“log
number
ﬁeld”]
may
be
regarded
as
the
analogue
of
the
ﬁniteness
of
the
Verschiebung
on
indigenous
bundles
given
in
[Mzk1],
Chapter
II,
Theorem
2.3
[which
implies
the
ﬁniteness
of
the
set
of
isomorphism
classes
of
nilpotent
indigenous
bundles
over
a
given
hyperbolic
curve
in
positive
characteristic].
Remark
5.10.4.
The
analogy
with
Frobenius
liftings
that
appears
in
the
discussion
of
Remark
5.10.3
is
interesting
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
theory
of
[Mzk21],
§2
[cf.,
especially
[Mzk21],
Remark
2.9.1].
Indeed,
[Mzk21],
§2,
may
be
thought
of
as
a
theory
concerning
the
issue
of
passing
from
decomposition
groups
to
ring
[i.e.,
additive!]
structures
in
a
p-adic
setting
[cf.
[Mzk21],
Corollary
2.9],
hence
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
p-adic
analogue
of
the
lemma
of
Uchida
reviewed
in
Proposition
1.3.

Appendix:
Complements
on
Complex
Multiplication
In
the
present
Appendix,
we
expose
the
portion
of
the
well-known
theory
of
abelian
varieties
with
complex
multiplication
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Lang-CM],
[Milne-CM],
for
more
details]
that
underlies
the
observation
“(∗CM
)”
—
i.e.,
roughly
speaking,
to
the
eﬀect
that,
if
p
is
a
prime
number,
then
every
Lubin-Tate
character
on
an
open
subgroup
of
the
inertia
group
of
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
a
p-adic
local
ﬁeld
arises,
after
possible
restriction
to
an
open
subgroup,
from
a
subquotient
of
the
p-adic
Tate
module
associated
to
an
abelian
variety
with
complex
multiplication
—
related
to
the
author
by
A.
Tamagawa
[cf.
[Mzk20],
Remark
3.8.1].
In
particular,
we
verify
that
this
observation
(∗CM
)
does
indeed
hold.
[Here,
we
remark
in
passing
that
the
proof
of
(∗CM
)
given
in
the
present
Appendix
is,
according
to
Tamagawa,
apparently
somewhat
diﬀerent
from
the
proof
that
he
originally
considered.
Unfortunately,
however,
he
was
unable
to
recall
the
details
of
his
original
argument.]
This
implies
that
the
observation
“(∗A-qLT
)”
discussed
in
[Mzk20],
Remark
3.8.1,
also
holds,
and
hence,
in
particular,
that
the
hypothesis
of
[Mzk20],
Corollary
3.9,
to
the
eﬀect
that
“either
(∗A-qLT
)
or
(∗CM
)
holds”
may
be
eliminated
[i.e.,
that
[Mzk20],
Corollary
3.9,
holds
unconditionally].
On
the
other
hand,
we
conclude
the
present
Appendix
by
observing
that,
in
this
context,
there
still
remains
an
interesting
open
problem
that
could
serve
to
stimulate
further
research.
In
the
following,
we
shall
ﬁx
a
prime
number
p
and
write
Q
for
the
ﬁeld
of
rational
numbers,
Zp
for
the
topological
ring
of
p-adic
integers,
Qp
for
the
topological
ﬁeld
of
p-adic
numbers,
R
for
the
topological
ﬁeld
of
real
numbers,
C
for
the
topological
ﬁeld
of
complex
numbers,
ι
:
C
→
C
for
the
automorphism
of
C
given
by
complex
conjugation,
and
Qalg
⊆
C
for
the
subﬁeld
of
algebraic
numbers.
Also,
we
shall
use
the
notation
“O”
to
denote
the
ring
of
integers
associated
to
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Q
or
Qp
and
the
notation
“tr(−)
”
to
denote
the
trace
map
associated
to
a
ﬁnite
ﬁeld
extension
“(−)”.
(CM1)
Fix
a
ﬁnite
extension
L
of
degree
d
≥
1
of
Qp
.
Thus,
L
=
Qp
(α)
for
some
α
∈
L.
Let
f
(x)
∈
Qp
[x]
be
a
monic
irreducible
polynomial
such
that
f
(α)
=
0.
If
def
def
d
=
2,
then
set
g(x)
=
x2
+
1;
if
d
=
2,
then
set
g(x)
=
(x
−
1)(x
−
2)
·
.
.
.
·
(x
−
d).
Thus,
both
f
(x)
∈
Qp
[x]
and
g(x)
∈
Q[x]
are
of
degree
d.
Then
by
approximating
the
coeﬃcients
of
f
and
g
by
elements
of
Q
at
the
p-adic
and
real
places
of
Q,
we
conclude
that
there
exists
a
monic
polynomial
h(x)
∈
Q[x]
of
degree
d
such
that
the
following
conditions
hold:
(a)
there
exists
an
element
β
∈
L
such
that
h(β)
=
0
and
L
=
Qp
(β);
(b)
if
d
=
2,
then
the
complex
roots
of
h(x)
are
non-real
and
distinct;
(c)
if
d
=
2,
then
the
complex
roots
of
h(x)
are
real
and
distinct.
Indeed,
(a)
follows
by
arguing
as
in
[Kobl],
pp.
69-70;
(b)
follows
by
considering
the
sign
of
the
discriminant
of
h(x);
(c)
follows
by
considering
the
signs
of
values
of
g(x)
as
x
varies
over
the
real
numbers
in
the
various
intervals
between
roots
of
g(x).
Note
that
it
follows
from
(a)
that
the
polynomial
h(x)
∈
Q[x]
is
irreducible.
Thus,
we
obtain
a
number
ﬁeld
160
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
def
F
=
Q[x]/(h(x))
such
that
[F
:
Q]
=
d,
and
F
⊗Q
Qp
is
isomorphic
to
L.
If
d
=
2,
then
F
is
a
complex
quadratic
extension
of
Q,
hence
admits
an
element
γ
∈
F
\
Q
such
that
γ
2
∈
Q
[which
implies
that
γ
2
<
0,
F
=
Q(γ)].
Next,
let
us
observe
[cf.
[Kobl],
p.
81]
that
1
−
p3
admits
a
square
root
in
Qp
.
Thus,
if
d
=
2,
then
the
number
ﬁeld
F
is
totally
real
and
hence
linearly
disjoint
over
Q
from
the
complex
quadratic
def
extension
K0
=
Q(λ0
),
where
λ20
=
1
−
p3
.
In
particular,
if
d
=
2,
then
the
number
ﬁeld
def
K
=
F
·
K0
is
a
CM
ﬁeld
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Lang-CM],
Chapter
1,
§2]
of
degree
2d
over
Q.
(CM2)
Suppose
that
d
=
2.
Let
ϕ0
:
F
→
C
be
an
embedding
such
that
the
imaginary
part
of
ϕ0
(γ)
is
positive.
Write
ιF
∈
Gal(F/Q)
for
the
unique
nontrivial
element
of
Gal(F/Q)
[so
ϕ0
◦
ιF
=
ι
◦
ϕ0
].
Then
recall
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Lang-CM],
Chapter
1,
§4]
that
the
complex
torus
C/ϕ0
(OF
),
together
with
the
Riemann
form
determined
by
the
pairing
(ξ,
η)
→
trF/Q
(ξ
·
ιF
(η)
·
γ)
∈
Q
[where
ξ,
η
∈
F
],
determine
an
elliptic
curve
E
with
complex
multiplication
by
OF
,
which
is
deﬁned
over
some
ﬁnite
subextension
M
of
ϕ0
(F
)
in
C.
Now
it
is
immediate
from
the
Main
Theorem
of
Complex
Multiplication
[i.e.,
Shimura
reciprocity
—
cf.,
e.g.,
[Lang-CM],
Chapter
4,
Theorem
1.1;
[Milne-CM],
Theorem
10.1]
that
there
def
exists
an
open
subgroup
H
of
the
inertia
group
⊆
GM
=
Gal(Qalg
/M
)
associated
to
some
prime
of
Qalg
that
divides
p
such
that
H
acts
on
the
p-adic
Tate
module
associated
to
E
via
the
Lubin-Tate
character
associated
to
L.
This
completes
the
proof
of
(∗CM
)
in
the
case
d
=
2.
(CM3)
Suppose
that
d
=
2.
Let
Φ0
be
a
collection
of
d
embeddings
K
→
C
of
K
into
the
complex
numbers
such
that
every
embedding
F
→
C
is
obtained
as
the
restriction
of
an
element
of
Φ0
,
and,
moreover,
the
embeddings
of
Φ0
map
λ0
to
a
complex
number
whose
imaginary
part
is
positive.
[Thus,
the
embeddings
of
Φ0
coincide
on
K0
.]
Fix
an
element
ϕ0
∈
Φ0
.
Thus,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
both
Φ0
and
def
Φ
=
{ϕ0
}
∪
{ι
◦
ϕ
|
ϕ0
=
ϕ
∈
Φ0
}
form
CM
types
of
K
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Lang-CM],
Chapter
1,
§2].
Moreover,
if
we
write
def
Φι0
=
{ι
◦
ϕ
|
ϕ
∈
Φ0
},
then
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
the
set
of
embeddings
K
→
C
[or,
equivalently,
K
→
Qalg
]
∼
Φ0
∪
Φι0
→
Φ0
×
{id,
ι}
def
[where
id
denotes
the
identity
automorphism
of
C]
admits
a
natural
action
by
GQ
=
Gal(Qalg
/Q)
that
preserves
the
product
decomposition
[induced
by
restricting
the
embeddings
in
question
to
F
or
K0
]
of
the
above
display.
Then
one
veriﬁes
immedidef
ately
that
the
subgroup
of
GQ
that
stabilizes
Φ0
is
equal
to
GK0
=
Gal(Qalg
/K0
),
and
hence
that
the
reﬂex
ﬁeld
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Lang-CM],
Chapter
1,
§5]
associated
to
(K,
Φ0
)
is
equal
to
ϕ0
(K0
).
On
the
other
hand,
observe
that
our
assumption
that
d
=
2
implies
that
the
cardinalities
[namely,
1
and
d
−
1]
of
the
intersections
Φ
∩
Φ0
and
Φ
∩
Φι0
are
distinct.
Thus,
since
the
action
of
any
element
of
GQ
on
Φ0
∪
Φι0
is
TOPICS
IN
ABSOLUTE
ANABELIAN
GEOMETRY

161
compatible
with
the
projection
to
the
set
{id,
ι},
one
veriﬁes
immediately
[by
considering
the
ﬁbers,
i.e.,
Φ0
and
Φι0
,
of
this
projection]
that
our
assumption
that
d
=
2
implies
that
an
element
of
GQ
stabilizes
Φ
if
and
only
if
it
ﬁxes
ϕ0
.
In
particular,
we
conclude
that
the
reﬂex
ﬁeld
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Lang-CM],
Chapter
1,
§5]
associated
to
(K,
Φ)
is
equal
to
ϕ0
(K).
(CM4)
We
continue
our
analysis
of
the
situation
discussed
in
(CM3).
Write
ιK
∈
Gal(K/F
)
for
the
unique
nontrivial
element
of
Gal(K/F
)
[so
ϕ
◦
ιK
=
ι
◦
ϕ,
for
all
ϕ
∈
Φ].
Observe
that
by
approximating
λ0
relative
to
ϕ0
and
−λ0
relative
to
ϕ
∈
Φ
\
{ϕ0
},
one
may
construct
an
element
λ
∈
K
such
that
the
imaginary
part
of
ϕ(λ)
is
positive
for
all
ϕ
∈
Φ.
Moreover,
by
replacing
λ
by
λ
−
ιK
(λ),
one
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
ιK
(λ)
=
−λ.
Next,
recall
[cf.,
e.g.,
[LangCM],
Chapter
1,
§4]
that
the
CM
type
(K,
Φ),
together
with
the
lattice
OK
⊆
K
and
the
Riemann
form
determined
by
the
pairing
(ξ,
η)
→
trK/Q
(ξ
·
ιK
(η)
·
λ)
∈
Q
[where
ξ,
η
∈
K],
determine
a
polarized
abelian
variety
A
with
complex
multiplication
by
OK
,
which
is
deﬁned
over
some
ﬁnite
subextension
M
of
ϕ0
(K)
def
in
C.
Next,
write
GM
=
Gal(Qalg
/M
),
Tp
(A)
for
the
p-adic
Tate
module
associated
to
A.
Thus,
Tp
(A)
admits
a
natural
structure
of
rank
one
free
OK
⊗
Zp
-module,
as
well
as
a
natural
GM
-action.
In
particular,
since
OK
⊗
Zp
∼
=
OL
⊕
OL
,
we
thus
conclude
that
Tp
(A)
admits
a
direct
sum
decomposition
Tp
(A)
=
T

⊕
T

as
a
direct
sum
of
rank
one
free
OL
-modules
T

,
T

.
On
the
other
hand,
let
us
recall
that
the
Main
Theorem
of
Complex
Multiplication
[i.e.,
Shimura
reciprocity
—
cf.,
e.g.,
[Lang-CM],
Chapter
4,
Theorem
1.1;
[Milne-CM],
Theorem
10.1]
allows
one
to
compute
the
Galois
action
of
GM
on
Tp
(A)
by
means
of
the
reﬂex
type
norm
applied
to
an
idèle
of
M
.
In
particular,
it
follows
immediately
from
our
construction
of
Φ
from
Φ0
in
(CM3),
together
with
the
resulting
computation
of
the
associated
reﬂex
ﬁeld,
that,
after
possibly
interchanging
T

and
T

,
there
exists
an
open
subgroup
H
of
the
inertia
group
⊆
GM
associated
to
some
prime
of
Qalg
that
divides
p
such
that
H
acts
on
T1
via
the
Lubin-Tate
character
×
χLT
:
H
→
OL
associated
to
L
[i.e.,
in
essence,
via
the
embedding
ϕ0
]
and
on
T2
via
the
dual
character
×
χ∗LT
:
H
→
OL
[that
is
to
say,
the
character
determined
by
the
relation
χLT
·
χ∗LT
=
χcycl
,
where
χcycl
:
H
→
Z×
p
is
the
cyclotomic
character,
i.e.,
in
essence,
via
the
product
of
the
embeddings
∈
Φ
\
{ϕ0
}].
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
observation
(∗CM
)
[for
arbitrary
d].
(CM5)
The
above
argument
completes
the
proof
of
the
observation
(∗CM
)
and
hence
also
of
the
observation
(∗A-qLT
),
of
[Mzk20],
Remark
3.8.1.
On
the
other
hand,
we
conclude
by
observing
that,
in
this
context,
the
following
problem
remains
unresolved:
Let
X
be
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
a
ﬁnite
extension
k
of
Qp
.
Then
is
it
always
the
case
that
the
étale
fundamental
group
of
X
is
of
A-qLT-type
[cf.
[Mzk20],
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(v)]?
Here,
we
recall
that,
roughly
speaking,
this
condition
of
being
“of
A-qLT-type”
may
be
described
as
the
condition
that
every
Lubin-Tate
character
on
the
inertia
162
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
subgroup
of
an
open
subgroup
of
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
k
arises,
after
possibly
restricting
to
an
open
subgroup,
from
some
subquotient
of
the
p-adic
Tate
module
of
the
Jacobian
of
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
X
[cf.
[Mzk20],
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(v),
for
more
details].
Thus,
(∗A-qLT
)
consists
of
the
assertion
that
this
problem
admits
an
aﬃrmative
answer
whenever
X
admits
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
that,
in
turn,
admits
a
dominant
map
to
a
copy
of
the
projective
line
minus
three
points
over
k.
We
recall
from
[Mzk20],
Remark
3.8.1,
that
(∗A-qLT
)
is
derived
from
(∗CM
)
by
using
Belyi
maps.
Thus,
the
above
unresolved
problem
is
particularly
of
interest
in
the
case
of
various
“classes”
of
X
for
which
techniques
involving
Belyi
maps
cannot
be
applied,
e.g.,
the
case
of
proper
X.
Finally,
we
observe
that
this
problem
may
also
be
understood
in
the
context
of
the
general
theme
of
applications
of
Belyi
maps,
i.e.,
in
the
style
of
Belyi
injectivity
or
[André],
Theorems
7.2.1,
7.2.3
[which
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
padic
version
of
Belyi
injectivity].
In
the
case
of
Belyi
injectivity
or
André’s
results,
a
version
for
arbitrary
hyperbolic
curves
was
obtained,
by
applying
techniques
from
combinatorial
anabelian
geometry,
in
[HM1],
Theorem
C
[in
the
case
of
Belyi
injectivity]
and
[HM2],
Theorem
B
[in
the
case
of
André’s
results].
On
the
other
hand,
in
the
case
of
the
unresolved
problem
discussed
above,
it
is
not
clear
to
the
author
at
the
present
time
how
to
apply
techniques
from
combinatorial
anabelian
geometry
to
resolve
this
problem.
