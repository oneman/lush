In
this
paper,
we
study
the
pro-Σ
fundamental
groups
of
conﬁguration
spaces,
where
Σ
is
either
the
set
of
all
prime
numbers
or
a
set
consisting
of
a
single
prime
number.
In
particular,
we
show,
via
two
somewhat
distinct
approaches,
that,
in
many
cases,
the
“ﬁber
subgroups”
of
such
fundamental
groups
arising
from
the
various
natural
projections
of
a
conﬁguration
space
to
lower-dimensional
conﬁguration
spaces
may
be
characterized
group-theoretically.

Deﬁnition

(i)].
By
omitting
the
factors
corresponding
to
various
subsets
of
the
set
of
n
copies
of
X,
we
obtain
various
natural
projection
morphisms
Xn
→
Xm
for
nonnegative
integers
m
≤
n
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.1,
(ii)].
Next,
let
ΣC
be
either
the
set
of
all
prime
numbers
or
a
set
consisting
of
a
single
prime
number.
Write
C
for
the
class
of
all
ﬁnite
groups
of
order
a
product
of
primes
∈
ΣC
.
Then
by
considering
the
maximal
pro-C
quotient
of
the
étale
fundamental
group,
which
we
denote
by
“π1C
(−)”,
we
obtain
various
natural
surjections
π1C
(Xn
)

π1C
(Xm
)
arising
from
the
natural
projection
morphisms
considered
above.
We
shall
refer
to
the
kernel
of
such
a
surjection
π1C
(Xn
)

π1C
(Xm
)
as
a
ﬁber
subgroup
of
π1C
(Xn
)
of
length
n
−
m
and
co-length
m
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.3,
(iii)].
Also,
we
shall
refer
to
a
closed
subgroup
of
π1C
(Xn
)
that
arises
as
the
inverse
image
of
a
closed
subgroup
of
π1C
(Pn
)
via
the
natural
surjection
π1C
(Xn
)

π1C
(Pn
)
[induced
by
the
inclusion
Xn
→
Pn
]
as
product-theoretic
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.3,
(ii)].
The
present
paper
is
concerned
with
the
issue
of
the
group-theoretic
characterization
of
these
ﬁber
subgroups.
Our
main
results
[cf.
Corollaries
4.8,
6.3]
may
be
summarized
as
follows:
(i)
Suppose
that
g
≥
2.
Let
H

⊆
π1C
(Xn
)
be
a
product-theoretic
open
subgroup.
Then
the
subgroups
H
F
of
H
—
where
F
ranges
over
the
various
ﬁber
subgroups
of
π1C
(Xn
)
—
may
be
characterized
group-theoretically
[cf.
Corollary
4.8].
(ii)
Suppose
that
(g,
r)
is
not
equal
to
(0,
3)
or
(1,
1).
Then
the
ﬁber
subgroups
of
π1C
(Xn
)
may
be
characterized
group-theoretically
[cf.
Corollary
6.3].
The
proof
of
(i)
is
obtained
as
a
consequence
of
the
following
result
[cf.
Theorem
4.7]:
(iii)
In
the
notation
of
(i),
every
normal
closed
subgroup
J
⊆
H
such
that
the
quotient
group
H/J
is
abelian
and
torsion-free
is,
in
fact,
product-theoretic.
The
proof
of
(iii)
is
based
on
a
slightly
complicated
computation
involving
Chern
classes
[cf.
§4],
together
with
the
well-known
fact
that
the
action
of
the
Galois
group
of
a
ﬁnite
Galois
covering
of
a
curve
of
genus
≥
2
on
the
Tate
module
of
the
Jacobian
of
the
covering
curve
contains
the
regular
representation
[cf.
Proposition
1.3].
On
the
other
hand,
the
proof
of
(ii),
due
to
the
second
author,
makes
essential
use
to
the
notion
of
a
“nearly
abelian
group”,
i.e.,
a
proﬁnite
group
G
which
admits
a
normal
closed
subgroup
N
⊆
G
which
is
topologically
normally
generated
by
a
single
element
∈
G
such
that
G/N
contains
an
open
abelian
subgroup
[cf.
Deﬁnition
6.1].
It
is
worth
noting
that
at
the
time
of
writing,
we
are
unable
to
prove
either
an
analogue
of
(i)
for
g
<
2
or
an
analogue
of
(ii)
when
(g,
r)
is
equal
to
(0,
3)
or
(1,
1).

The
original
proof
of
(i)
[due
to
the
ﬁrst
author]
given
in
§4
may
be
regarded
as
a
consequence
of
various
explicit
group-theoretic
manifestations
of
certain
algebrogeometric
properties.
This
proof
of
(i)
motivated
the
second
author
to
develop
a
more
direct
approach
to
understanding
these
essentially
purely
algebro-geometric
properties.
This
approach,
which
is
exposed
in
§5,
allows
one
to
prove
a
stronger
version
[cf.
Theorem
5.6],
in
the
case
of
proper
hyperbolic
curves,
of
Theorem
4.7
and,
moreover,
implies
certain
interesting
consequences
concerning
the
nonexistence
of
units
on
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
a
suﬃciently
generic
hyperbolic
curve
[cf.
Corollary
5.7].
The
contents
of
the
present
paper
may
be
summarized
as
follows:
Basic
wellknown
facts
concerning
the
proﬁnite
fundamental
groups
of
hyperbolic
curves
and
conﬁguration
spaces,
including
a
certain
mild
generalization
of
a
theorem
of
LubotzkyMelnikov-van
den
Dries,
are
reviewed
in
§1,
§2,
respectively.
In
§3,
we
discuss
the
group-theoreticity
of
direct
product
decompositions
of
proﬁnite
groups.
In
§4,
§6,
we
present
the
proofs,
via
somewhat
diﬀerent
techniques,
of
the
main
results
(i),
(ii)
discussed
above.
In
§5,
we
discuss
the
algebraic
geometry
of
divisors
and
units
on
conﬁguration
spaces,
a
theory
which
yields
an
alternate
approach
to
the
theory
of
§4,
in
the
case
of
proper
hyperbolic
curves.
Finally,
in
§7,
we
observe
that
these
results
(i),
(ii)
imply
a
certain
discrete
analogue
[cf.
Corollary
7.4]
of
(i),
(ii).

Numbers:
The
notation
Q
will
be
used
to
denote
the
ﬁeld
of
rational
numbers.
The
notation
Z
⊆
Q
will
be
used
to
denote
the

group,
or

of
rational
integers.
The
notation
N
⊆

will
be
used
to
denote
the

[additive]
monoid
of
nonnegative

If
l
is

then
the

Ql
(respectively,

Topological
Groups:
Let
G
be
a
Hausdorﬀ
topological
group,
and
H
⊆
G
a
closed
subgroup.
Let
us
write

centralizer
of
H
in
G.
Also,
we
shall
write
Z(G)
=
ZG
(G)
for
the
center
of
G.
We
shall
say
that
a
proﬁnite
group
G
is
slim
if
for
every
open
subgroup
H
⊆
G,
the
centralizer
ZG
(H)
is
trivial.
Note
that
every
ﬁnite
normal
closed
subgroup
N
⊆
G
of
a
slim
proﬁnite
group
G
is
trivial.
[Indeed,

this
follows
by
observing
that
for
any
normal
open

H

such
that
N

consideration
of
the

reveals
that
the
conjugation
action
of
H
on
N
is
trivial,
i.e.,
that
N
⊆
ZG
(H)
=
{1}.]
We
shall
write
Gab
for
the
abelianization
of
G,
i.e.,
the
quotient
of
G
by
the
closure
of
the
commutator
subgroup
of
G.
We
shall
denote
the
group
of
automorphisms
of
G
by
Aut(G).
Conjugation
by
elements
of
G
determines
a
homomorphism
G
→
Aut(G)
whose
image
consists
of
the
inner
automorphisms
of
G.
We
shall
denote
by
Out(G)
the
quotient
of
Aut(G)
by
the
[normal]
subgroup
consisting
of
the
inner
automorphisms.
In
particular,
if
G
is
center-free,
then
we
have
an
exact
sequence
1
→
G
→
Aut(G)
→
Out(G)
→
1.
Curves:
Suppose
that
g
≥
0
is
an
integer.
Then
if
S
is
a
scheme,
a
family
of
curves
of
genus
g
X→S
is
deﬁned
to
be
a
smooth,
proper,
geometrically
connected
morphism
of
schemes
X
→
S
whose
geometric
ﬁbers
are
curves
of
genus
g.
Suppose
that
g,
r
≥
0
are
integers
such
that
2g
−
2
+
r

0.
We
shall
denote
the
moduli
stack
of
r-pointed
stable
curves
of
genus
g
over
Z
(where
we
assume
the
points
to
be
ordered)
by
Mg,r
[cf.
[DM],
[Knud]
for
an
exposition
of
the
theory
of
such
curves].
The
open
substack
Mg,r
⊆
Mg,r
of
smooth
curves
will
be
referred
to
as
the
moduli

of
smooth
r-pointed
stable
curves
of
genus
g
or,
alternatively,
as
the
moduli
stack
of
hyperbolic
curves
of
type
(g,
r).
The
divisor
at
inﬁnity
Mg,r
\Mg,r
of
Mg,r
is
a
divisor
with
normal
crossings
on
the
Z-smooth
algebraic
stack
Mg,r
,
hence
determines
a
log
structure
on
Mg,r
;
denote
the
resulting
log
log
stack
by
Mg,r
.
For
any
integer
r

>
r,
the
operation
of
“forgetting
the
last
r

−
r
points”
determines
a
[1-]morphism
of
log
algebraic
stacks
log
log
Mg,r
→
Mg,r
which
factors
as
a
composite
of
structure
morphisms
of
various
tautological
log
stable
curves
[cf.
[Knud]],
hence
is
log
smooth.
A
family
of
hyperbolic
curves
of
type
(g,

is
deﬁned
to
be
a

which

and
a

of

One
checks
easily
that,
if
S
is

then
the

(Y,

is
unique
up
to
canonical

We

Section
1:
Surface
Groups
In
the
present
§1,
we
discuss
various
well-known
preliminary
facts
concerning
the
sorts
of
proﬁnite
groups
that
arise
from
étale
fundamental
groups
of
hyperbolic
curves.
Deﬁnition
1.1.
Let
C
be
a
family
of
ﬁnite
groups
containing
the
trivial
group;
Σ
a
set
of
prime
numbers.
(i)
We
shall
refer
to
a
ﬁnite
group
as
a
Σ-group
if
every
prime
dividing
its
order
belongs
to
Σ.
We
shall
refer
to
a
ﬁnite
group
belonging
to
C
as
a
C-group
and
to
a
proﬁnite
group
every
ﬁnite
quotient
of
which
is
a
C-group
as
a
pro-C
group.
We
shall
refer
to
C
as
a
full
formation
[cf.
[FJ],
p.
343]
if
it
is
closed
under
taking
quotients,
subgroups,
and
extensions.
(ii)
Suppose
that
C
is
a
full
formation;
write
ΣC
for
the
set
of
primes
p
such

Then

Z

C
for
the
maximal
pro-C
quotient
of
Z.
that
Z/pZ
is
a
C-group
and
Z
we
shall
say
that
the
formation
C
is
nontrivial
if
there
exists
a
nontrivial
C-group
[or,
equivalently,
if
ΣC
is
nonempty].
We
shall
say
that
the
formation
C
is
primary
if
ΣC
is
of
cardinality
one.
We
shall
say
that
the
formation
C
is
solvable
if
every
C-group
is
solvable.
We
shall
say
that
the
formation
C
is
total
if
every
ﬁnite
group
is
a
C-group.
We
shall
say
that
C
is
a
PT-formation
if
it
is
either
primary
or
total.
We
shall
say
that
C
is
invertible
on
a
scheme
S
if
every
prime
of
ΣC
is
invertible
on
S.
(iii)
Suppose
that
C
is
a
full
formation;
let
G
be
a
proﬁnite
group.
If
G
admits
an
open
subgroup
H
which
is
abelian,
then
we
shall
say
that
G
is
almost
abelian.
If
G
admits
an
open
subgroup
H
which
is
pro-C,
then
we
shall
say
that
G
is
almost
pro-C.
We
shall
refer
to
a
quotient
G

Q
as
almost
pro-C-maximal
if
for
some
open
subgroup
H
⊆
G
with
maximal
pro-C
quotient
[cf.
[FJ],
p.
344]
H

P
,
we
have
Ker(G

Q)
=
Ker(H

P
).
[Thus,
any
almost
pro-C-maximal
quotient
of
G
is
almost
pro-C.]
If
G
is
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated,
and,
moreover,
the
abelianization
J
ab
of
every
open
subgroup
J
⊆
G
is
torsion-free,
then
we
shall
say
that
G
is
strongly
torsion-free.
Remark
1.1.1.
The
notion
of
a
full
formation
is
a
special
case
of
the
notion
of
a
Melnikov
formation
[cf.
[FJ],
p.
343].
In
the
present
paper,
[partly
for
the
sake
of
simplicity]
we
restrict
ourselves
to
full
formations.
Remark
1.1.2.
Let
C
be
a
full
formation.
Then
[it
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions
that]
a
solvable
ﬁnite
group
is
a
ΣC
-group
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(ii)]
6
SHINICHI

AND

if
and
only
if
it
is
a
C-group.
In
particular,
if
C
is
solvable,
then
it
is
completely
determined
by
the
set
of
primes
ΣC
.
Remark
1.1.3.
Recall
that
every
ﬁnite
group
whose
order
is
a
prime
power
is
nilpotent,
hence,
in
particular,
solvable.
Thus,
[cf.
Remark
1.1.2]
a
primary
full
formation
C
is
completely
determined
by
the
unique
prime
number
∈
ΣC
.
Remark
1.1.4.
One
veriﬁes
immediately
that
in
the
various
deﬁnitions
in
Definition
1.1,
(iii),
of
terms
of
the
form
“almost
P”,
where
“P”
is
some
property,
an
equivalent
deﬁnition
is
obtained
if
one
requires
the
open
subgroup
“H”
to
be
normal.
Remark
1.1.5.
If
G
is
a
strongly
torsion-free
proﬁnite
group,
then
one
veriﬁes
immediately
[by
considering
abelianizations
of
open
subgroups
of
G]
that
G
is
torsion-free
in
the
usual
sense,
i.e.,
that
G
has
no
nontrivial
elements
of
ﬁnite
order.
Deﬁnition
1.2.
Let
C
be
a
full
formation.
We
shall
say
that
a
proﬁnite
group
is
a
[pro-C]
surface
group
(respectively,
an
almost
pro-C-surface
group)
if
it
is
isomorphic
to
the
maximal
pro-C
quotient
(respectively,
to
some
almost
proC-maximal
quotient)
of
the
étale
fundamental
group
of
a
hyperbolic
curve
[cf.
§0]
over
an

closed
ﬁeld
of

zero
[or,
equivalently,
the
proﬁnite
completion
of
the
topological
fundamental
group
of
a
hyperbolic
Riemann
surface
of
ﬁnite
type].
We
shall
refer
to
an
almost
pro-C-surface
group
as
open
(respectively,
closed)
if
it
admits
(respectively,
does
not
admit)
a
pro-C
free
[cf.
[FJ],
p.
345]
open
subgroup.
Remark
1.2.1.
Thus,
in
the
notation
of
Deﬁnition
1.2,
every
pro-C
surface
group
is
an
almost
pro-C-surface
group.
On
the
other
hand,
if
C
is
not
total,
then
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
there
exist
almost
pro-C-surface
groups
which
are
not
proC
surface
groups.
Nevertheless,
every
almost
pro-C-surface
group
admits
a
normal
open
subgroup
which
is
a
pro-C
surface
group.
Remark
1.2.2.
We
recall
that
if
Π
is
a
pro-C
surface
group
arising
from
a
hyperbolic
curve
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.2]
of
type
(g,
r),
then
Π
is
topologically
generated
by
2g
+
r
generators
subject
to
a
single
[well-known!]
relation,
and
Πab
[cf.
§0]
is
a
free
abelian
pro-C
group
of
rank
2g
−
1
+
r
(if
r
>
0),
2g
(if
r
=
0).
In
particular,
[since
every
open
subgroup
of
Π
is
again
a
pro-C
surface
group,
it
follows
that]
Π
is
strongly
torsion-free.
Moreover,
for
any
l
∈
ΣC
,
the
l-cohomological
dimension
of
Π
is
equal
to
1
(if
r
>
0),
2
(if
r
=
0);
dimQl
(H

(Π,

))
=
dimFl
(H
2
(Π,
Fl
))
is
equal
to
0
(if
r
>
0),
1
(if
r
=
0).
In
particular,
the
quantity
χ(Π)
=
2

·
dimQl
(H

(Π,

=

is

satisﬁes
the
property
that
χ(Π1

[Π

·
χ(Π)
for
any

Finally,
we
recall
that
this
formula
admits
a
representation-theoretic
generalization,
which
will
play
a
crucial
role
in
§4
below,
in
the
form
of
the
following
elementary
consequence:
Proposition
1.3.
(Inclusion
of
the
Regular
Representation)
Let
Y
→
X
be
a
ﬁnite
[possibly
ramiﬁed]
Galois
covering
of
smooth
proper
hyperbolic
curves
over
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
k
of
characteristic
prime
to
the
order
of
def
G
=
Gal(Y
/X);
l
a
prime
number
that
is
invertible
in
k.
Write
V
for
the
G-module
1
determined
by
the
ﬁrst
étale
cohomology
module
Hét
(Y,
Ql
).
Then
the
G-module
V
contains
the
regular
representation
of
G
as
a
direct
summand.
Proof.
Indeed,
this
follows
immediately
from
the
computation
of
the
Galois
module
V
in
[Milne],
p.
187,
Corollary
2.8
[cf.
also
[Milne],
p.
187,
Remark
2.9],
in
light
of
our
assumption
that
X
is
proper
hyperbolic,
hence
of
genus
≥
2.

Proposition
1.4.
(Slimness)
Let
C
be
a
nontrivial
full
formation.
Then
every
almost
pro-C-surface
group
Π
is
slim.
Proof.
Indeed,
this
follows
immediately
by
considering
the
conjugation
action
of
Π/N
on
N
ab
⊗
Zl
,
where
l
∈
ΣC
,
for
suﬃciently
small
normal
open
subgroups
N
⊆
Π
[cf.
Remark
1.2.1].
That
is
to
say,
in
light
of
the
interpretation
of
a
certain
quotient
of
N
ab
⊗
Zl
as
the
Tate
module
arising
from
the
l-power
torsion
points
of
the
Jacobian
of
the
compactiﬁcation
of
the
covering
determined
by
N
of
any
hyperbolic
curve
that
gives
rise
to
Π
[cf.
the
proof
of
[Mzk3],
Lemma
1.3.1],
it
follows
that
this
conjugation
action
is
faithful.
Another
[earlier]
approach
to
the
slimness
of
surface
groups
may
be
found
in
[Naka],
Corollary
1.3.4.

Remark
1.4.1.
The
property
involving
the
regular
representation
discussed
in
Proposition
1.3
may
be
regarded
as
a
stronger
version
[in
the
case
of
coverings
of
curves
of
genus
≥
2]
of
the
faithfulness
of
the
action
of
Π/N
on
[a
certain
quotient
of]
N
ab
⊗
Zl
that
was
applied
in
the
proof
of
Proposition
1.4,
hence,
in
particular,
as
a
stronger
version
of
the
slimness
of
surface
groups.
Next,
we
give
a
mild
generalization
to
arbitrary
surface
groups
of
a
well-known
result
for
free
pro-C
groups
due
to
Lubotzky-Melnikov-van
den
Dries.
In
particular,
the
argument
given
below
in
the
proof
of
Theorem
1.5
may
be
regarded
as
a
short
elementary
proof
of
[a
certain
portion
of]
the
theorem
of
Lubotzky-Melnikov-van
den
Dries,
as
exposed
in
[FJ],
Proposition
24.10.3;
[FJ],
Proposition
24.10.4,
(a).
Theorem
1.5.
(Normal
Closed
Subgroups
of
Surface
Groups)
Let
C
be
a
full
formation;
Π
an
almost
pro-C-surface
group;
N
⊆
Π
a
topologically
8
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
AND
AKIO
TAMAGAWA
ﬁnitely
generated
normal
closed
subgroup.
Then
N
is
either
trivial
or
of
ﬁnite
index.
Proof.
First,
we
observe
that
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
C
is
nontrivial.
Since
Π
is
slim,
hence
does
not
contain
any
nontrivial
ﬁnite
normal
closed
subgroups
[cf.
§0],
it
follows
that
we
may
always
replace
Π
by
an
open
subgroup
of
Π.
In
particular,
[cf.
Remark
1.2.1]
we
may
assume,
without
loss
of
generality,
that
Π
is
a
pro-C
surface
group.
Now
suppose
that
N
is
nontrivial
and
of
inﬁnite
index.
Then
there
exists
an
l
∈
ΣC
such
that
N
contains
a
nontrivial
subgroup
A
⊆
N
which
is
a
quotient
of
Zl
.
In
particular,
there
exists
a
normal
open
subgroup
Π1
⊆
Π
such
that
the
image
of
A
in
Π/Π1
is
nontrivial.
Now
set

def
def
ΠA
=
Π1
·
A
⊆
Π,
NA
=
N
ΠA
[so
ΠA
,
NA
are
open
subgroups
of
Π,
N
,
respectively].
Then
NA
is
a
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated
normal
closed
subgroup
of
inﬁnite
index
of
ΠA
such
that
A
⊆
NA
surjects
onto
the
[nontrivial,
abelian!]
image
of
ΠA
in
Π/Π1
.
In
particular,
by
replacing
N
⊆
Π
by
NA
⊆
ΠA
,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
the
image
of
N
in
Πab
is
nontrivial.
Since
Π
is
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated,
there
exists
a
descending
sequence
of
normal
open
subgroups
.
.
.
⊆
Hn
⊆
.
.
.
⊆
Π
[where
n
ranges
over
the
positive
integers]
of
Π
which
is,
moreover,
exhaustive,

def
i.e.,
n
Hn
=
{1}.
Thus,
if
we
set
Nn
=
Hn
·
N
[for
n
≥
1],
then
[one
veriﬁes
immediately
that]
we
obtain
a
descending
sequence
of
normal
open
subgroups
.
.
.
⊆
Nn
⊆
.
.
.
⊆
Π

[where
n
ranges
over
the
positive
integers]
of
Π
such
that
n
Nn
=
N
[cf.
the
fact
that
N
is
closed!].
Since
N
is
of
inﬁnite
index
in
Π,
it
follows
that
[Π
:
Nn
]
→
∞
as
n
→
∞,
hence
[cf.
Remark
1.2.2]
that
|χ(Nn
)|
→
∞
as
n
→
∞.
In
particular,
there
exists
an
n
such
that
the
rank
[as
a
free
abelian
pro-C
group]
of
Nnab
is
≥
s
+
2,
where
we
write
s
for
any
positive
integer
such
that
there
exist
s
elements
of
N
that
topologically
generate
N
.
Since,
moreover,
the
image
of
N
in
Πab
,
hence
a
fortiori
in
Nnab
is
nontrivial,
it
follows
that
there
exists,
for
some
l
∈
ΣC
,
a
nontrivial
homomorphism
Zl
→
Nnab
that
factors
through
N
.
Now
write
Nn

Π
∗
for
the
maximal
pro-l
quotient
of
Nn
[so
Π∗
is
a
pro-l
surface
group],
N
∗
⊆
Π∗
for
the
image
of
N
in
Π∗
.
Thus,
N
∗
⊆
Π∗
is
a
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated
normal
closed
subgroup
whose
image
in
[the
free
Zl
-module
of
ﬁnite
rank]
(Π∗
)ab
is
a
nontrivial
Zl
-submodule
M
⊆
(Π∗
)ab
whose
rank
is
≤
s,
hence
≤
the
rank
of
(Π∗
)ab
minus
2.
In
particular,
there
exists
an
element
x
∈
Π∗
such
that
if
we
denote
by
F
∗
⊆
Π∗
the
[necessarily
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated!]
closed
subgroup
topologically
generated
by
N
∗
and
x,
then
we
obtain
inclusions
of
closed
subgroups
N
∗
⊆
F
∗
⊆
Π∗
THE
PROFINITE
FUNDAMENTAL
GROUPS
OF
CONFIGURATION
SPACES
9
such
that
N
∗
is
of
inﬁnite
index
in
F
∗
,
and
F
∗
is
of
inﬁnite
index
in
Π∗
[as
may
be
seen
by
considering
the
ranks
of
the
images
of
these
subgroups
in
Πab
].
Now
observe
that
for
any
two
open
subgroups
J2
⊆
J1
⊆
Π∗
,
the
induced
morphism
H
2
(J1
,
Zl
)
→
H
2
(J2
,
Zl
)
maps
a
generator
of
H
2
(J1
,
Zl
)
to
[J1
:
J2
]
times
a
generator
H
2
(J2
,
Zl
)
[where
we
recall
that
H
2
(J1
,
Zl
),
H
2
(J2
,
Zl
)
are
either
both
zero
or
both
isomorphic
to
Zl
,
depending
on
whether
Π
is
an
open
or
a
closed
surface
group].
[Indeed,
this
follows
immediately
by
thinking
about
degrees
of
coverings
of
proper
hyperbolic
curves!
We
refer
to
Remark
4.1.1;
Lemma
4.2,
(i)
[and
its
proof],
below,
for
more
details
on
this
well-known
circle
of
ideas.]
In
particular,
since
F
∗
is
a
subgroup
of
inﬁnite
index
in
Π∗
,
it
follows
immediately
[by
considering
open
subgroups
J
⊆
Π∗
containing
F
∗
]
that
F
∗
is
a
pro-l
group
whose
[l-]cohomological
dimension
is
≤
1.
Thus,
by
[RZ],
Theorem
7.7.4,
F
∗
is
a
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated
free
pro-l
group
[i.e.,
in
particular,
a
pro-l
open
surface
group],
and
N
∗
⊆
F
∗
is
a
nontrivial
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated
closed
normal
subgroup
of
inﬁnite
index.
Put
another
way,
it
suﬃces
to
prove
Theorem
1.5
in
the
case
where
Π
is
a
pro-l
open
surface
group.
Thus,
we
return
to
the
original
notation
of
the
statement
of
Theorem
1.5,
under
the
further
assumption
that
Π
is
a
pro-l
open
surface
group
[and
N
is
nontrivial
of
inﬁnite
index].
Since
N
is
of
inﬁnite
index
in
Π,
by
replacing
Π
by
an
open
subgroup
containing
N
[cf.
the
argument
above
involving
the
“Hn
”
and
“Nn
”],
we
may
assume
that
the
rank
of
Π
is
>
the
rank
of
N
.
Thus,
[cf.,
e.g.,
[RZ],
the
proof
of
Theorem
7.7.4]
dimFl
(Πab
⊗
Fl
)
>
dimFl
(N
ab
⊗
Fl
).
Next,
observe
that
there
exists
ab
a
normal
open
subgroup

H
⊆∼
Π
such
that
the
natural
surjection
N

N
⊗
Fl
factors
through
N/(N
H)
→
(N
·
H)/H.
But
this
implies
that
the
inclusion
N
→
N
·
H
induces
a
homomorphism
N
ab
⊗
Fl
→
(N
·
H)ab
⊗
Fl
that
admits
a

∼
∼
splitting
(N
·
H)ab
⊗
Fl

((N
·
H)/H)ab
⊗
Fl
→
(N/(N
H))ab
⊗
Fl
→
N
ab
⊗
Fl
.
In
particular,
by
replacing
Π
by
the
open
subgroup
N
·
H
[where
we
note
that
dimFl
((N
·H)ab
⊗Fl
)
≥
dimFl
(Πab
⊗Fl
)],
we
may
assume,
without
loss
of
generality,
that
the
natural
homomorphism
N
ab
⊗Fl
→
Πab
⊗Fl
is
injective,
but
not
surjective.
Thus,
it
follows
[cf.,
e.g.,
[RZ],
the
proof
of
Theorem
7.7.4]
that
there
exists
a
collection
of
free
generators
{γi
}i∈I
[where
I
is
a
ﬁnite
set]
of
Π
such
that
for
some
nonempty
proper
subset
I

⊆
I,
the
{γi
}i∈I

form
a
collection
of
free
generators
of
N
.
But,
as
is
well-known
[and
easily
veriﬁed,
by
applying
the
universal
property
of
free
pro-l
groups,
together
with
the
existence
of
non-normal
cyclic
subgroups
of
ﬁnite
l-groups!],
this
contradicts
the
normality
of
N
.

Section
2:
Conﬁguration
Space
Groups
In
the
present
§2,
we
discuss
various
well-known
preliminary
facts
concerning
the
sorts
of
proﬁnite
groups
that
arise
from
étale
fundamental
groups
of
conﬁguration
spaces
associated
to
hyperbolic
curves.
First,
let
us
suppose
that
we
have
been
given
a
log
scheme
Z
log
10
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
AND
AKIO
TAMAGAWA
which
is
log
regular
[cf.,
[Kato2],
Deﬁnition
2.1];
write
UZ
⊆
Z
for
the
interior
of
Z
log
[i.e.,
the
open
subscheme
on
which
the
log
structure
of
Z
log
is
trivial].
By
abuse
of
notation,
we
shall
often
use
the
notation
for
a
scheme
to
denote
the
log
scheme
with
trivial
log
structure
determined
by
the
scheme.
If
C
is
a
full
formation
that
is
invertible
on
Z,
and
Z
is
connected,
then
we
shall
write
π1C
(Z
log
)
for
the
maximal
pro-C
quotient
of
the
étale
fundamental
group
[obtained
by
considering
Kummer
log
étale
coverings,
for
some
choice
of
basepoint
—
cf.
[Ill]
for
more
details]
of
Z
log
.
Thus,
by
the
log
purity
theorem
of
Fujiwara-Kato
[cf.
[Ill];
[Mzk1],
Theorem
B],
the
natural
morphism
UZ
→
Z
log
induces
a
[continuous
outer]
∼
isomorphism
π1C
(UZ
)
→
π1C
(Z
log
).
Next,
suppose
that
S
is
a
regular
scheme,
and
that
X→S
is
a
family
of
hyperbolic
curves
of
type
(g,
r)
over
S,
with
compactiﬁcation
X
→
Y
→
S
and
divisor
of
cusps
D
⊆
Y
[cf.
§0].
For
simplicity,
we
assume
that
the
ﬁnite
étale
covering
D
→
S
is
split.
Let
n
∈
N.

Write

Let

Proof.
First,
let
us
observe
that
since
the
kernel
of
the
natural
surjection
π1C
(Xs
)

π1C
(Ys
)
is
topologically
normally
generated
by

groups

[which

”
is
as

(1),
where
the
“(1)”
denotes
a
“Tate
twist”,
and
“Z
are
isomorphic
to
Z
in
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(ii)],
condition
(c)
[together
with
our
assumption
that
the
divisor
of
cusps
of
X
→
S
is
split]
implies
that
for
each
l
∈
ΣC
,
the
image
of
the
natural
Galois
action
π1
(S)
→
Aut(π1
(Xs
)ab
⊗
Fl
)
arising
from
the
family
of
hyperbolic
curves
X
→
S
is
a
C-group.
Now
we
claim
that
to
complete
the
proof
of
Proposition
2.2,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
assertion
(v).
Indeed,
let
us
assume
that
assertion
(v)
holds
and
reason
by
induction
on
n
≥
1.
[That
is
to
say,
if
n
≥
2,
then
we
assume
that
assertions
(i),
(ii),
and
(iii)
have
already
been
veriﬁed
for
“n
−
1”.]
Then
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
assertion
(iv)
follows
from
assertion
(v)
by
a
standard
argument
in
elementary
algebraic
geometry
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk4],
Proposition
2.3,
(ii),
in
the
case
where
k
is
of
characteristic
zero,
n
=
1;
since
C
is
invertible
on
UZ
,
and
we
are
free
to
apply
assertion
(v),
the
case
of
positive
characteristic
k
and
arbitrary
n
is
entirely
similar].
Next,
observe
that
[in
light
of
Remark
2.1.2;
the
easily
veriﬁed
fact
that
the
family
Xn
→
Xn−1
also
satisﬁes
conditions
(a),
(b),
(c)]
assertion
(i)
is
a
special
case
of
assertion
(iii)
for
“n
=
1”;
thus,
[by
applying
the
induction
hypothesis]
we
may
assume
that
assertion
(i)
holds
if
n
≥
2.
Since,
moreover,
the
property
of
being
a
slim
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated
proﬁnite
group
holds
for
a
proﬁnite
group
which
is
an
extension
of
a
proﬁnite
group
G1
by
a
proﬁnite
group
G2
whenever
it
holds
for
G1
and
G2
,
assertion
(ii)
[for
“n”]
follows
immediately,
by
applying
the
induction
hypothesis,
from
assertion
(i)
(when
n
≥
2)
and
Proposition
1.4.
As
for
assertion
(iii),
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
by
assertions
(iv),
(v)
[and
various
standard
arguments
in
elementary
algebraic
geometry],
we
may
assume
without

loss
of
generality
that
s
arises
from
an
algebraic
closure
of
the
function
ﬁeld
K
def
of
S.
Thus,
by
considering
the
natural
action
of
GK
=
π1
(Spec(K),
s)
on
s,
we
obtain
a
natural
outer
action
GK
→
Out(π1C
((Xn
)s
))
which
is
compatible
with
the
natural
outer
action
of
GK
on
π1C
((Pn
)s
)
[which
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
product
of
n
copies
of
π1C
(Xs
)],
relative
to
the
natural
inclusion
Xn
→
Pn
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.1,
(i)].
In
particular,
since
[by
Zariski-Nagata
purity
—
i.e.,
the
classical
non-logarithmic
version
of
the
“log
purity
theorem”
quoted
above]
the
kernel
of
the
natural
surjection
π1C
((Xn
)s
)

π1C
((Pn
)s
)
is
topologically
normally
generated
by
the
inertia
groups
of
the
divisors
of
(Pn
)s
lying
in

C
(1)],
condition
the
complement
(Pn
\Xn
)s
[which
are
isomorphic
to
quotients
of
Z
(c)
[together
with
the
observation
at
the
beginning
of
the
present
proof]
implies
that
for
each
l
∈
ΣC
,
the
image
of
the
natural
Galois
action
GK
→
Aut(π1
((Xn
)s
)ab
⊗
Fl
)
is
a
C-group,
hence
[cf.
Remark
1.1.3
when
C
is
primary]
that
the
homomorphism
GK
→
Out(π1C
((Xn
)s
))
factors
through
the
maximal
pro-C
quotient
GCK
of
GK
.
Note,
moreover,
that
[again]
by
Zariski-Nagata
purity
[i.e.,
the
classical
non-logarithmic
version
of
the
“log
purity
theorem”
quoted
above],
the
kernel
of
the
natural
surjection
GCK

π1C
(S)
is
topologically
normally
generated
by
the
various
inertia
groups
determined
by
the
prime
divisors
of
S.
On
the
other
hand,
by
assertion
(v),
the
images
of
these
inertia
groups
in
Out(π1C
((Xn
)s
))
are
trivial.
Thus,
we
obtain
a
homomorphism
π1C
(S)
→
Out(π1C
((Xn
)s
)),
hence
—
by
pulling
back
the
natural
exact
sequence
1
→
π1C
((Xn
)s
)
→
Aut(π1C
((Xn
)s
))
→
Out(π1C
((Xn
)s
))
→
1
[cf.
assertion
(ii);
§0]
via
this
homomorphism
—
an
exact
sequence
as
in
assertion
(iii).
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
claim.
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(v).
First,
we
remark
that
assertion
(v)
is
a
special
case
of
the
more
general
result
of
[Vid],
Théorème
2.2;
since,
however,
[Vid]
has
yet
to
be
published
at
the
time
of
writing,
we
give
a
self-contained
[modulo
published
results]
proof
of
assertion
(v),
as
follows.
We
begin
by
observing
that
by
the
log
purity
theorem,
we
have
natural
isomorphisms
∼
π1C
((Xn
)s
)
→
π1C
((Znlog
)s
);
∼
π1C
((Xn
)η
)
→
π1C
((Znlog
)η
)
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.1,
(i);
Remark
2.1.1].
Now
suppose
that
W0log
→
(Znlog
)s
is
a
connected
Kummer
log
étale
covering.
Since
(Znlog
)s
is
log
regular,
it
thus
follows
that
W0log
is
also
log
regular,
hence,
in
particular,
normal.
By
the
deﬁnition
of
“log
étale”,
one
may
deform
this
covering
to
a
formal
Kummer
log
étale
covering
over
the
mR
-completion
[where
mR
is
the
maximal
ideal
of
R]
of
Znlog
.
Moreover,
the
underlying
scheme
of
this
formal
covering
may
be
algebrized
[cf.
[EGA
III],
Théorème
5.4.5;
the
easily
veriﬁed
fact
that
Zn
is
projective],
hence
determines
a
14
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
AND
AKIO
TAMAGAWA
ﬁnite
morphism
W
→
Zn
.
Now
it
follows
from
the
well-known
local
structure
of
Kummer
log
étale
coverings
that
the
formal
covering
that
gave
rise
to
W
is
S-ﬂat,
hence
that
W
itself
is
S-ﬂat,
with
normal
special
ﬁber
Ws
∼
=
W0
.
Since
S
is,
of
course,
normal,
we
thus
conclude
[cf.
[EGA
IV],
Corollaire
6.5.4,
(ii)]
that
W
is
normal
and
connected,
hence
irreducible.
By
considering
the
formal
covering
that
gave
rise
to
W
at
completions
of
closed
points
of
Zn
lying
in
the
interior
Xn
⊆
Zn
,
it
follows,
moreover,
that
W
→
Zn
is
generically
étale.
Thus,
it
makes
sense
to
speak
of
the
ramiﬁcation
divisor
in
Zn
of
W
→
Zn
.
On
the
other
hand,
again
by
considering
the
formal
covering
that
gave
rise
to
W
,
it
follows
immediately
that
this
ramiﬁcation
divisor
is
contained
in
the
complement
of
Xn
in
Zn
,
hence
[by
the
log
purity
theorem!]
that
W
→
Zn
determines
a
Kummer
log
étale
covering
W
log
→
Znlog
whose
special
ﬁber
Wslog
→
(Znlog
)s
may
be
naturally
identiﬁed
with
the
given
covering
W0log
→
(Znlog
)s
.
Thus,
by
algebrizing
morphisms
between
formal
Kummer
log
étale
coverings
[cf.
[EGA
III],
Théorème
5.4.1],
we
conclude
that
the
deformation
and
algebrization
procedure
just
described
determines
an
equivalence
of
categories
between
the
categories
of
Kummer
log
étale
coverings
of
(Znlog
)s
,
Znlog
.
∼
In
particular,
we
obtain
a
natural
isomorphism
π1C
((Znlog
)s
)
→
π1C
((Znlog
)).
On
the
other
hand,
again
by
the
log
purity
theorem,
it
follows
immediately
that
we
obtain
an
isomorphism
∼
C
log

π1C
((Znlog
)η
)
→
lim
←−
π1
(Zn

[where
S

ranges
over
the
normalizations
of
S
in
the
various
ﬁnite

of
K
in

of

hence,
by
applying
the
isomorphisms
∼
π1C
(Znlog

)
→
π1C
((Znlog

)
[where
we
regard
s


]
obtained
above,
we
obtain
∼
an
isomorphism
π1C

as
desired.

Proof.
Assertions
(i),
(ii)
are
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions
[and
Remark
2.1.2].
Next,
let
us
consider
assertion
(vi).
In
light
of
assertions
(i),
(ii),
it
suﬃces
to
verify
assertion
(vi)
in
the
case
where
F2
=
Π;
also,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
F1
is
of
length
1.
Then,
by
induction
on
n
[cf.
also
assertion
(i)],
Π/F1
is
topologically
generated
by
its
ﬁber
subgroups
of
length
1.
Since
the
inverse
image
in
Π
of
any
ﬁber
subgroup
of
length
1
of
Π/F1
is
clearly
a
ﬁber
subgroup
of
length
2,
it
follows
[cf.
assertions
(i),
(ii)]
that
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
n
=
2.
But
then
it
suﬃces
to
observe
that
if
Fα
,
Fβ
⊆
Π
are
ﬁber
subgroups
whose
proﬁles
Eα
,
Eβ
⊆
E
are
disjoint
subsets
of
length
1,
then
the
natural
morphism
Fα
⊆
Π

Π/Fβ
[which
is
simply
the
morphism
induced
on
“π1C
(−)’s”
by
an
open
immersion
of
hyperbolic
curves]
is
a
surjection.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(vi).
Now
assertion
(iv)
follows
formally
from
assertion
(vi);
also,
in
light
of
assertion
(vi),
assertion
(iii)
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions.
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(v).
First,
let
us
observe
that
when
n
=
2,
assertion
(v)
follows
by
observing
that
the
kernel
of
the
natural
surjection
π1C
(X2
)

π1C
(P2
)
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.3,
(ii)]
is
topologically
normally
generated
by
the
inertia

C
(1)
[hence
topologgroup
of
the
diagonal
divisor
of
X2
,
which
is
isomorphic
to
Z
ically
generated
by
a
single
element].
Now
assertion
(v)
follows
immediately
for
arbitrary
n,
by
applying
assertions
(i),
(ii),
(iv).

Remark
2.4.1.
Note
that
it
follows
immediately
from
Proposition
2.2,
(ii);
Proposition
2.4,
(i)
[or,
alternatively,
(vi)],
that
the
ﬁber
subgroups
of
π1C
(Xn
)
are
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated
normal
closed
subgroups.
Section
3:
Direct
Products
of
Proﬁnite
Groups
In
the
present
§3,
we
study
quotients
of
products
of
proﬁnite
groups.
In
particular,
we
show
that,
in
certain
cases,
the
product
decomposition
of
a
direct
product
of
proﬁnite
groups
is
“group-theoretic”.
Deﬁnition
3.1.
Let
G
be
a
proﬁnite
group.
Then
we
shall
say
that
G
is
∼
indecomposable
if,
for
any
isomorphism
of
proﬁnite
groups
G
→
H
×
J,
where
H,
J
are
proﬁnite
groups,
it
follows
that
either
H
or
J
is
the
trivial
group.
We
shall
say
that
G
is
strongly
indecomposable
if
every
open
subgroup
of
G
is
indecomposable.
Proposition
3.2.
(The
Indecomposability
of
Surface
Groups)
Let
C
be
a
nontrivial
full
formation.
Then
every
almost
pro-C-surface
group
Π
is
strongly
indecomposable.
Proof.
Since
every
open
subgroup
of
an
almost
pro-C-surface
group
is
again
an
almost
pro-C-surface
group,
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
Π
is
indecomposable.
Suppose
THE
PROFINITE
FUNDAMENTAL
GROUPS
OF
CONFIGURATION
SPACES
17
that
we
have
an
isomorphism
of
proﬁnite
groups
Π
∼
=
H
×
J,
where
H,
J
are
nonabelian
[since
Π
is
slim
—
cf.
Proposition
1.4!]
inﬁnite
[again
since
Π
is
slim,
hence
does
not
contain
any
nontrivial
ﬁnite
normal
closed
subgroups
—
cf.
§0]
proﬁnite
groups.
Note
that
since
H,
J,
are
inﬁnite,
it
follows
that
for
any
open
subgroup
Π1
,
we
may
always
replace
Π
by
an
open
subgroup
of
Π1
.
In
particular,
[cf.
Remark
1.2.1]
we
may
assume,
without
loss
of
generality,
that
Π
is
a
pro-C
surface
group
arising
from
a
curve
of
genus
≥
2.
Now
we
claim
that
for
every
prime
number
l
∈
ΣC
,
there
exist
ﬁnite
quotients
H

QH
,
J

QJ
such
that
l
divides
the
order
of
QH
,
QJ
.
Indeed,
suppose
that
l
does
not
divide
the
order
of
any
ﬁnite
quotient
of
H.
Then
there
exists
a
proper
normal
open
subgroup
NH
⊆
H
such
def
that
if
we
set
N
=
NH
×
J
⊆
Π,
then
the
conjugation
action
of
Π/N
∼
=
H/NH
on
ab
ab
ab
ab
∼
∼
N
⊗
Zl
=
(NH
⊗
Zl
)
×
(J
⊗
Zl
)
=
J
⊗
Zl
is
trivial,
which,
as
was
seen
in
the
proof
of
Proposition
1.4,
leads
to
a
contradiction.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
claim.
Thus,
by
replacing
Π
by
the
maximal
pro-l
quotient
of
a
suitable
open
subgroup
of
Π
for
some
l
∈
ΣC
[and
replacing
C
by
the
primary
formation
determined
by
l],
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
Π,
H,
J
are
pro-l
groups.
Note,
moreover,
that
since
H,
J
are
nonabelian
pro-l
groups,
it
follows
that
dimFl
(H
ab
⊗
Fl
)
≥
2,
dimFl
(J
ab
⊗
Fl
)
≥
2
[cf.,
e.g.,
[RZ],
Proposition
7.7.2].
On
the
other
hand,
observe
that
the
cup
product
morphism
H
1
(H,
Fl
)
⊗
H
1
(J,
Fl
)
→
H
2
(Π,
Fl
)
is
an
injection.
[Indeed,
this
follows
immediately
by
considering
the
spectral
sequences
associated
to
the
surjections
Π
∼
=
H
×
J

J,
H

{1},
where
we
note
that
the
latter
surjection
may
be
regarded
as
a
quotient
of
the
former
surjection.]
But
this
implies
that
dimFl
(H
2
(Π,
Fl
))
≥
2,
which
[cf.
Remark
1.2.2]
is
absurd.
This
completes
the
proof
of
Proposition
3.2.

Remark
3.2.1.
Note
that
the
strong
indecomposability
of
Proposition
3.2
may
also
be
derived
as
an
immediate
consequence
of
Theorem
1.5,
in
light
of
the
slimness
of
Proposition
1.4.
Proposition

(Quotients

Let

that
N

[cf.
§0],
and
the
composite
Π

Q/N
of
φ
with
the
surjection

induces
an

—
where
we
write
Gi
=
Gi
/Hi
.
In
particular,
if
Q
is
center-free,
then
we
obtain
∼
an
isomorphism
Π
→
Q;
if
Q
is
center-free
and
indecomposable,
then
we
obtain
∼
an
isomorphism
Gi
→
Q
for
some
i
∈
{1,
.
.
.
,
n}.
def
Proof.
Indeed,
write
I
=
Ker(φ)
⊆
Π;
Ii
⊆
Gi
for
the
inverse
image
of
I
via
the
natural
injection
ιi
:
Gi
→
Π
into
the
i-th
factor;
Hi
⊆
Gi
for
the
image
of
I
under
the
natural
projection
πi
:
Π

Gi
to
the
i-th
factor
[where
i
∈
{1,
.
.
.
,
n}].
Thus,
we
have
inclusions
def
ΠI
=
n

def
Ii
⊆
I
⊆
Π
H
=
i=1
n

Hi
⊆
Π
i=1
inside
Π.
Now
observe
that
the
commutator
of
any
element
(1,
.
.
.
,
1,
gi,
1,
.
.
.
,
1)
∈
Π
[i.e.,
all
of
whose
components,
except
possibly
the
i-th
component
gi
∈
Gi
,
are
equal
to
1]
with
an
element
h
∈
I
yields
an
element
of
I
[since
I
is
normal
in
Π]
which
lies
in
the
image
of
ιi
,
hence
determines
an
element
of
Ii
⊆
Gi
,
which
is
in
fact
equal
to
the
commutator
[gi
,
πi
(h)]
∈
Gi
[where
we
observe
that
πi
(h)
∈
Hi
]
computed
in
Gi
.
In
particular,
since
gi
∈
Gi
is
arbitrary,
and
any
element
of
Hi
arises
as
such
a
“πi
(h)”,
it
follows
that
the
commutator
subgroup
[Gi
,
Hi
]
is
contained
in
Ii
.
But
this
implies
that
the
commutator
subgroup
[Π,
ΠH
]
is
normally
generated
in
Π
by
elements
of
ΠI
⊆
I,
hence
[since
I
is
normal
in
Π]
is
contained
in
I.
Put
∼
another
way,
if
we
set
N
⊆
Q
equal
to
the
image
in
Π/I
→
Q
of
ΠH
,
then
it
follows
that
N
⊆
Z(Q).
On
the
other
hand,
it
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
φ
n
∼
determines
an
isomorphism
i=1
(Gi
/Hi
)
→
Q/N
,
as
desired.

Remark
3.3.1.
Proposition
3.3
may
be
regarded
as
being
motivated
by
the
following
elementary
fact
concerning
products
of
rings:
If
R1
,
.
.
.
,
Rn
[where
n
≥
1
is
an
integer]
are
[not
necessarily
commutative]
rings
with
unity
and
def
φ:R
=
n

Ri

Q
i=1
is
a
surjection
of
rings
with
unity,
then
there
exist
two-sided
ideals
Ii
⊆
Ri
[for
i
=
1,
.
.

,
n]
such
that
φ
induces
an
isomorphism
def
R
=
n

∼
Ri
→
Q
i=1
def
—
where
we
write
Ri
=
Ri
/Ii
.
[Indeed,
this
follows
immediately
by
observing
that
if,
for
i
=
1,
.
.
.
,
n,
we
write
ei
∈
R
for
the
element
whose
i-th
component
is
1
and
whose
other
components
are
0,
then
any
element
f

Ker(φ)
may
be
written
in
the

Remark
3.3.2.
Proposition
3.3
is
due
to
the
second
author.
We
observe
in
passing
that
when,
in
the
notation
of
Proposition
3.3,
Q
is
an
almost
pro-C-surface
group
for
some
nontrivial
full
formation
C
[hence
slim
and
strongly
indecomposable
—
cf.
Propositions
1.4,
3.2],
and
the
Gi
are
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated,
one
may
give
a
diﬀerent
proof
of
Proposition
3.3
by
applying
Theorem
1.5
to
the
images
Ji
of
the
various
composites
of
φ
with
the
natural
inclusions
ιi
:
Gi
→
Π
—
which
allows
one
to
conclude
[in
light
of
the
slimness
of
Q!]
that
only
one
of
the
Ji
[as
i
ranges
over
the
integers
1,
.
.
.
,
n]
can
be
nontrivial.
In
fact,
this
argument
was
the
approach
originally
taken
by
the
ﬁrst
author
to
proving
Proposition
3.3
and,
moreover,
underlies
the
proof
of
the
main
result
of
this
paper
via
the
approach
of
the
second
author
given
in
§6
below.
On
the
other
hand,
this
argument
[unlike
the
very
elementary
proof
of
Proposition
3.3
given
above!]
has
the
drawback
that
it
depends
on
the
generalization
of
the
result
of
Lubotzky-Melnikov-van
den
Dries
given
in
Theorem
1.5.
This
drawback
was
pointed
out
by
the
second
author
to
the
ﬁrst
author
when
the
ﬁrst
author
ﬁrst
informed
the
second
author
of
this
restricted
version
of
Proposition
3.3
and,
indeed,
served
to
motivate
the
second
author
to
obtain
the
more
elementary
proof
of
Proposition
3.3
given
above.

.
For
i
=
1,

.

,
n;
j
=
1,
.
.
.
,
m,
write
Hj=
⊆
ΠH
G=
i
⊆
ΠG
;
for
the
respective
intersections
of
G,
H
with
the
images
of
the
natural
injections
Gi
→
ΠG
,
Hj
→
ΠH
;
G=

i
⊆
ΠG
;
for
the
respective
intersections
of
G,
H
with
the
kernels
of
the
natural
projections
ΠG

Gi
,
ΠH

Hj
.
Now
we
claim
that
for
each
j
=
1,
.
.
.
,
m,
the
kernel
of
the
composite
ψj
:
G
→
Hj
of
α
with
the
natural
projection
(H
⊆)
ΠH

Hj
contains
G=
i
,
for
a
unique
i
∈
{1,
.
.
.
,
n}.
Indeed,
since
the
image
of
ψj
is
open,
hence
slim,
it
follows
[cf.
§0]
that
this
image
has
no
nontrivial
ﬁnite
normal
closed
subgroups;
since
the
G=
i
are
normal
closed
subgroups
of
G,
it
thus
suﬃces
to
prove
that
the
kernel
of
the
restriction
of
ψj
to
the
open
subgroup
of
G
⊆
ΠG
determined
by
the
direct
product

of
the
G=
i
[for
i
=
1,
.
.
.
,
n]
contains
the
intersection
of
this
open
subgroup
with
=
Gi
,
for
a
unique
i.
But
[since
Hj
is
slim
and
strongly
indecomposable]
this
follows
formally
from
Proposition
3.3.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
claim.
Note,
moreover,
that
[in
the
notation
of
the
claim]
the
assignment
j
→
i
determines
a
map
{1,
.
.
.
,
m}
→
{1,
.
.
.
,
n},
which,
in
light
of
the
injectivity
of
α,
is
easily
veriﬁed
to
be
surjective.
But
this
implies
that
m
≥
n;
thus,
by
applying
this
argument
to
α−1
,
we
obtain
that
m
=
n.
In
particular,
the
map
{1,
.
.
.
,
m}
→
{1,
.
.
.
,
n}
considered
above
is
a
bijection,
whose
inverse
we
denote
by
σ.
By
rearranging
the
indices,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
σ
is
the
identity.
Now
it
follows
from
the
deﬁnition
of
[the
map
that
gave
rise
to]
σ
that
we
obtain
a
surjection

αi
:
G
i

Hi
for
each
i
=
1,
.
.
.
,
n,
such
that
the
restriction
of
[the
composite
with
the
inclusion
into
ΠH
of]
the
surjection

(α1
,
.
.
.
,
αn
)
:
ΠG
⊇
n

i=1
(G
i
)

n

(Hi
)

⊆
ΠH
i=1
to
G
coincides
with
[the
composite
with
the
inclusion
into
ΠH
of]
α.
In
particular,
since
α
is
injective,
it
follows
that
the
kernel
of
each
αi
is
a
ﬁnite
closed
normal
subgroup
of
an
open
subgroup
of
Gi
.
Thus,
by
the
slimness
of
Gi
,
we
conclude
[cf.
§0]
that
the
αi
are
injective,
as
desired.

Product-theoretic
Quotients
In
the
present
§4,
we
show
that
in
the
case
of
genus
≥
2,
the
[closure
of
the]
commutator
subgroup
of
a
product-theoretic
open
subgroup
of
a
conﬁguration
space
group
is,
up
to
torsion,
again
product-theoretic
[cf.
Theorem
4.7].
This
result,
combined
with
the
theory
of
§3,
implies
a
rather
strong
result,
in
the
case
of
genus
≥
2,
concerning
the
group-theoreticity
of
the
various
ﬁber
subgroups
associated
to
a
conﬁguration
space
group
[cf.
Corollary
4.8].
Let
Y
be
a
connected
smooth
variety
over
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
k
which
[for
simplicity]
we
assume
to
be
of

zero.
Deﬁnition
4.1.
Let

Then
we

such
that

Remark
4.1.1.
As
is
well-known,
it
follows
immediately
from
the

spectral
sequence
in

[cf.,
e.g.,
[Milne],



whenever

Also,
we
observe
that
it
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
the
condition
“1-good”
is
vacuous.
Let
f
:Z→Y
be
a
family
of
hyperbolic

over
Y
;
y

(k).
We
shall
denote
ﬁbers

by
means
of
a
subscript
“y”.
Suppose
that
we
have
also
been
given
a
section
s:Y

f
,
whose
image
we
denote
by
Ds
⊆

Write
UZ

Now
it

to

Suppose
that

Note,

that

Theorem
4.7.
(Strongly
Torsion-free
Pro-solvable
Product-theoreticity)
Let
X
be
a
hyperbolic
curve
of
genus
≥
2
over
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
k
of
characteristic
zero;
n
≥
1
an
integer;
Xn
the
n-th
conﬁguration
space
associated
to
X;
H
⊆
π1
(Xn
)
a
product-theoretic
open
subgroup;
G
a
strongly
torsion-free
pro-solvable
proﬁnite
group.
Then
the
kernel
of
any
continuous
homomorphism
H
→G
is
product-theoretic.
Proof.
First,
we
claim
that
it
suﬃces
to
verify
Theorem
4.7
in
the
case
where
G
=
Zl
[for
some
prime
number
l].
Indeed,
since
G
is
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(iii)],
and
arbitrary
intersections
of
product-theoretic
closed
subgroups
of
π1
(Xn
)
are
clearly
product-theoretic,
Theorem
4.7
for
arbitrary
[torsion-free]
abelian
G
follows
immediately
from
the
case
“G
=
Zl
”.
Thus,
by
replacing
H,
G
successively
by
appropriate
open
subgroups
of
H,
G,
Theorem
4.7
for
arbitrary
[strongly
torsion-free]
pro-solvable
G
follows
immediately
from
the
[torsion-free]
abelian
case.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
claim.
Thus,
in
the
following,
we
assume
that
G
=
Zl
.
Now
observe
that
Theorem
4.7
is
vacuous
for
n
=
1.
Thus,
by
induction
on
n,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
Theorem
4.7
for
“n
+
1”
under
the
assumption
that
it
holds
for
“n”.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
it
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
“product-theoretic”
that
any
covering
of
Xn+1
that
arises
from
a
product-theoretic
open
subgroup
J
⊆
π1
(Xn+1
)
is
dominated
by
a
covering
of
the
form
“WZ
→
Xn+1
”
for
WZ
as
in
Lemma
4.6.
Thus,
to
complete
the
proof
of
Theorem
4.7,
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
the
kernel
of
any
quotient
J

J
ab
⊗
Zl

Zl
is
product-theoretic,
for
J
corresponding
to
a
covering
“WZ
→
Xn+1
”
as
in
Lemma
4.6.
In
particular,
by
applying
Lemma
4.3,
(iii),
in
light
of
the
linear
independence
asserted
in
Lemma
4.6,
(iii),
and
the
induction
hypothesis
[which
may
be
applied
to
“Y
”,
via
Lemma
4.6,
(ii)],
we
conclude
that
the
kernel
of
such
a
quotient
J

Zl
is
product-theoretic,
as
desired.

Remark
4.7.1.
Note
that
Theorem
4.7
is
false
if
the
genus
of
X
is
<
2
and
n
≥
2.
Indeed,
to
construct
a
counter-example
for
arbitrary
n
≥
2,
it
suﬃces
to
construct
a
counter-example
for
n
=
2.
If,
moreover,
U
is
the
hyperbolic
curve
determined
by
an
open
subscheme
of
X,
then
consideration
of
the
natural
morphism
U2
→
X2
shows
that
the
existence
of
a
counter-example
for
X2
implies
the
existence
of
a
counter-example
for
U2
.
Thus,
we
may
assume,
without
loss
of
generality,
that
n
=
2,
and
X
is
either
of
type
(0,
3)
or
of
type
(1,
1).
But,
in
either
of
these
cases,
it
is
well-known
that
there
exists
a
dominant
map
X2

X
that
extends
to
a
map
X
×k
X
→
B
[where
B
is
a
compactiﬁcation
of
X]
that
maps
the
open
subscheme
X2
⊆
X
×k
X
into
X
⊆
B.
Thus,
by
pulling
back
an
appropriate
inﬁnite
cyclic
covering
of
some
ﬁnite

covering
of
X,
one
obtain
an
inﬁnite

let

that

Indeed,
this
follows
immediately
by
applying
induction
on
n
=

[cf.

Proposition
2.4,

Next,
for

let
us
write

for
the

of
co-length

with

given
by
the
element

Thus,
[cf.
Proposition

THE

the
fact
that

topologically
generate

in

Kjξ
is
not

.
Now
we
claim
that
to
complete
the
proof
of
Corollary
4.8,
it
suﬃces
to
prove
that
the
following
statement
holds
[in
general]:
For
each
i
∈
Eα
,
there
exists
a
j
∈
Eβ
such
that
Kjβ
⊆
γ(Kiα
).
Indeed,
by
applying
this
statement
to
γ,
γ
−1
,
we
conclude
that
for
each
i
∈
Eα
,
there
exist
j
∈
Eβ
,
i
∈
Eα
such
that
γ(Kiα
)
⊆
Kjβ
⊆
γ(Kiα
),
hence
that
Kiα
⊆
Kiα
.
But,
as
observed
above,
this
implies
that
i
=
i,
hence
that
Kjβ
=
γ(Kiα
).
Moreover,
this
relation
“Kjβ
=
γ(Kiα
)”
determines
an
assignment
i
→
j,
hence
a
mapping
σ
:
Eα
→
Eβ
,
which
is
a
bijection,
relative
to
which
intersections
with
Hα
,
Hβ
of
ﬁber
subgroups
of
co-length
one
with
corresponding
proﬁles
correspond
via
γ.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
claim.
To
verify
the
“statement”
of
the
above
claim,
we
reason
as
follows:
Let
l
∈
ΣC
.
Write
Hα
/Kiα

G
for
the
maximal
pro-l
quotient
of
Hα
/Kiα
;
∼
φ
:
Hβ
→
Hα

Hα
/Kiα

G
for
the
surjection
determined
by
γ
−1
.
Then
observe
that
since
Hα
/Kiα
is
a
pro-C
surface
group,
it
follows
that
G
is
a
pro-l
surface
group,
hence
strongly
torsionfree
[cf.
Remark
1.2.2]
and
pro-solvable
[cf.
Remark
1.1.3].
Thus,
it
follows
from
Theorem
4.7
that
φ
factors
through
the
quotient
Hβ

Qβ
determined
by
the
quotient
“π1C
(Xnββ
)

π1C
(Pnββ
)”
[i.e.,
the
image
of
Hβ
⊆
π1C
(Xnββ
)
in
π1C
(Pnββ
)]
corresponding
to
the
quotient
that
was
denoted
“π1C
(Xn
)

π1C
(Pn
)”
in
Deﬁnition
2.3,
(ii).
In
particular,
since
Qβ
admits
an
open
subgroup
with
a
direct
product
decomposition
induced
by
the
natural
direct
product
decomposition
of
π1C
(Pnββ
),
it
thus
follows
[since
G
is
slim
and
strongly
indecomposable
—
cf.
Propositions
1.4,
3.2]
from
Proposition
3.3
that
there
exists
a
j
∈
Eβ
such
that
the
image
of
Kjβ
in
G
is
a
ﬁnite
normal
closed
subgroup,
hence
trivial
[since
G
is
slim
—
cf.
Proposition
1.4,
§0].
But
this
implies
that
the
image
of
Kjβ
in
the
pro-C-surface
group
Hα
/Kiα
is
a
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated
[cf.
Proposition
2.2,
(ii)]
normal
closed
subgroup,
which
[since
G
is
inﬁnite]
is
of
inﬁnite
index,
hence
—
by
Theorem
1.5
—
trivial.
This
completes
the

Remark
4.8.1.
It
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
[NT],
Theorem
3.1
[cf.,
especially,
[NT],
Lemmas
3.3
–
3.6],
a
certain
analogue
of
Theorem
4.8
is
shown
for
graded
Lie
algebras.
More
generally,
the
idea
of
studying
conﬁguration
spaces
from
an
anabelian
point
of
view
dates
back
at
least
to
[Naka].
Remark
4.8.2.
The
original
motivation,
for
the
ﬁrst
author,
for
developing
the
theory
applied
to
prove
Corollary
4.8
was
the
idea
that
by
combining
Corollary
30
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
AND
AKIO
TAMAGAWA
4.8
with
the
techniques
of
[Mzk6],
[Mzk7],
one
could
obtain
results
in
the
absolute
anabelian
geometry
of
conﬁguration
spaces
over
p-adic
local
ﬁelds.
It
is
the
intention
of
the
ﬁrst
author
to
carry
out
this
application
of
Corollary
4.8
in
a
subsequent
paper.
Section
5:
Divisors
and
Units
on
Coverings
of
Conﬁguration
Spaces
In
the
present
§5,
we
discuss
a
certain
generalization
[cf.
Theorem
5.6;
Remark
5.6.1],
in
the
case
of
proper
hyperbolic
curves,
of
Theorem
4.7
[due
to
the
second
author].
Unlike
the
proof
of
Theorem
4.7
given
in
§4,
the
proof
of
this
generalization
does
not
rely
on
the
notion
of
“goodness”
or
properties
involving
the
“regular
representation”.
In
this
sense,
the
approach
given
in
the
present
§5
is
more
eﬃcient
and
relies
on
direct
algebro-geometric
properties
—
such
as
the
disjointness
of
divisors
—
of
which
the
properties
involving
the
“regular
representation”
applied
in
§4
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“étale-topological
translation”.
On
the
other
hand,
the
approach
of
§4
[which
was
discovered
ﬁrst,
by
the
ﬁrst
author],
though
less
eﬃcient,
is
applicable
to
both
aﬃne
and
proper
hyperbolic
curves,
and,
moreover,
has
the
virtue
of
relying
on
explicit
group-theoretic
manifestations
of
these
algebro-geometric
properties;
it
was
this
explicitness
that
served
to
render
the
approach
of
§4
more
readily
accessible
to
the
intuition
of
the
ﬁrst
author.
Finally,
we
discuss
certain
consequences
[cf.
Corollary
5.7]
of
the
theory
of
the
present
§5
concerning
the
“non-existence
of
units”
on
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
a
suﬃciently
generic
hyperbolic
curve.
We
begin
by
reviewing
some
essentially
well-known
generalities
concerning
log
schemes.
Deﬁnition
5.1.
Let
X
log
be
a
ﬁne
log
scheme
[cf.
[Kato1]].
(i)
Denote
by
MX
the
étale
sheaf
of
monoids
on
X
that
deﬁnes
the
log
structure
×
→
MX
,
which
we
shall
use
to
regard
on
X
log
.
Thus,
we
have
a
natural
injection
OX
×
OX
as
a
subsheaf
of
MX
.
We
shall
refer
to
the
quotient
sheaf
of
monoids
×
char
=
MX
/OX
MX
def
as
the
characteristic
of
X
log
and
to
the
associated
sheaf
of
groupiﬁcations
char-gp
MX
char
as
the
group-characteristic
of
X
log
.
Thus,
[since
X
log
is
ﬁne]
the
ﬁbers
of
MX
char-gp
(respectively,
MX
)
are
ﬁnitely
generated
torsion-free
abelian
monoids
(respectively,
abelian
groups).
For
n
∈
N,
we
shall
denote
by
[n]
UX
⊆
X
THE
PROFINITE
FUNDAMENTAL
GROUPS
OF
CONFIGURATION
SPACES
31
and
refer
to
as
the
n-interior
of
X
log
the
subset
[cf.
Proposition
5.2,
(i),
(ii)
below]
of
points
[of
the
scheme
X
lying
under
geometric
points
of
the
scheme
X]
at
which
[0]
char-gp
is
of
rank
≤
n.
Thus,
UX
is
the
interior
UX
⊆
X
of
X
log
[i.e.,
the
ﬁber
of
MX
the
open
subscheme
of
points
at
which
the
log
structure
of
X
log
is
trivial].
(ii)
Let
M
be
a
ﬁnitely
generated
[abstract]
abelian
monoid;
N
≥
1
an
integer.
We
shall
say
that
M
is
Q-regular
[with
exponent
N
]
if
for
some
n
∈
N,
the
map
Nn
→
Nn
[where
Nn
is
the
monoid
determined
by
the
product
of
n
copies
of
N]
given
by
multiplication
by
N
factors
as
a
composite
of
injections
of
monoids
Nn
→
M
→
Nn
.
We
shall
say
that
X
log
is
weakly
Q-regular
(respectively,
strongly
Q-regular)
if,
for
every
geometric
point
x
of
X,
the
ﬁber
of
Mxchar
at
x
is
a
Q-regular
monoid
(respectively,
Q-regular
monoid
with
exponent
invertible
in
the
residue
ﬁeld
of
x).
Proposition
5.2.
(Generalities
on
Log
Schemes)
Let
X
log
be
a
ﬁne
log
scheme;
n
∈
N;
l
a
prime
number
invertible
on
X.
Then:
[n]
(i)
The
n-interior
UX
⊆
X
is
open.
(ii)
Suppose
that
X
log
is
log
regular.
Then
the
complement
of
the
n-interior
def
[n]
UX
is
a
closed
subset
of
X
of
codimension
>
n;
the
complement
DX
=
X\UX
[equipped
with
the
reduced
induced
scheme
structure]
is
a
divisor
on
X.
(iii)
Suppose
that
X
log
is
log
regular
and
weakly
Q-regular.
Then
X
is
locally
Q-factorial
[i.e.,
every
Weil
divisor
on
X
admits
a
positive
multiple
which
is
Cartier].
Moreover,
if
X
is
connected,
and
G
is
any
torsion-free
proﬁnite
group,
then
any
homomorphism
of
proﬁnite
groups
[1]
φ
:
π1
(UX
)
→
G
[1]
factors
through
the
natural
surjection
of
étale
fundamental
groups
π1
(UX
)

π1
(X).
(iv)
Suppose
that
X
log
is
log
smooth
over
a
ﬁeld
k
[equipped
with
the
trivial
log
structure]
and
strongly
Q-regular;
let
F
⊆
X
be
a
closed
subset
of
codimension
≥
n.
Then
the
natural
map
on
étale
cohomology
j
j
(X,
Ql
)
→
Hét
(X\F,
Ql
)
Hét
is
an
isomorphism
for
j
≤
2n
−
2
and
an
injection
for
j
=
2n
−
1.
(v)
Under
the
assumptions
of
(iv),
suppose
further
that
X
is
connected;
write
DX
=

i∈I
DX,i
32
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
AND
AKIO
TAMAGAWA
—
where
I
is
a
ﬁnite
set;
the
DX,i
⊆
X
are
irreducible
divisors.
[Thus,
since
X
log
is
log
regular,
hence
normal
[cf.
[Kato2],
Theorem
4.1],
we
have
a
natural
surjection
of
étale
fundamental
groups
π1
(UX
)

π1
(X)
whose
kernel
contains
the
inertia
groups
of
the
DX,i
;
the
maximal
pro-l
quotient
of
each
of
these
inertia
groups
is
naturally
isomorphic
to
some
quotient
of
Zl
(1).]
Then
we
have
a
natural
exact
sequence
0
→
Hom(π1
(X),
Ql
(1))
→
Hom(π1
(UX
),
Ql
(1))
2
2
Ql
→
Hét
(X,
Ql
(1))
→
Hét
(UX
,
Ql
(1))
→
i∈I
—
where
the
“Hom’s”
denote
the
modules
of
continuous
homomorphisms
of
topological
groups;
the
second
arrow
is
the
arrow
determined
by
the
natural
surjection
π1
(UX
)

π1
(X);
the
third
arrow
is
the
arrow
determined
by
the
[copies
of
Zl
(1)
that
naturally
surject
onto
the]
inertia
groups
of
the
DX,i
[and
the
natural
identiﬁcation
of
Ql
with
Hom(Zl
(1),
Ql
(1))];
the
fourth
arrow
is
the
arrow
that
sends
the
1
∈
Ql
in
the
direct
summand
labeled
“i”
to
the
fundamental
class
c(DXi
)
of
the
Weil
divisor
DX,i
[which
is
well-deﬁned,
by
(iii)].
Proof.
Indeed,
assertion
(i)
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
a
ﬁne
log
scheme
[cf.
[Kato1],
§2.1-3].
In
light
of
assertion
(i),
the
portion
of
asser[n]
tion
(ii)
concerning
UX
follows
immediately
from
the
inequality
dim(OX,x
)
≥
char-gp
)x
)
[where
x
is
a
geometric
point
of
X;
OX,x
is
the
corresponding
rankZ
((MX
strict
henselization
of
a
local
ring
of
X]
—
cf.
the
deﬁnition
of
“log
regular”
in
[Kato2],
Deﬁnition
2.1.
Since
X
is
normal
[cf.
[Kato2],
Theorem
4.1],
the
portion
of
assertion
(ii)
concerning
DX
follows
immediately
from
the
description
given
in
[Kato2],
Theorem
11.6,
of
the
monoid
MX
in
terms
of
rational
functions
on
X.
To
verify
assertion
(iii)
(respectively,
(iv)),
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
it
follows
immediately
from
our
assumptions
that
X
log
is
log
regular
(respectively,
log
smooth
over
k)
and
weakly
Q-regular
(respectively,
strongly
Q-regular)
that
every
point
of
X
admits
an
étale
neighborhood
V
→
X
such
that
there
exists
a
ﬁnite
(respectively,
[ﬁnite]
Kummer
log
étale)
dominant
morphism
W
log
→
V
log
[where
we
equip
V
with
the
log
structure
pulled
back
from
X]
such
that
the
scheme
W
is
regular
(respectively,
smooth
over
k)
and
connected,
and
the
log
structure
of
W
log
arises
from
a
divisor
with
normal
crossings
on
W
.
Now
the
local
Q-factoriality
portion
of
assertion
(iii)
follows
immediately
by
pulling
back
a
given
Weil
divisor
on
X
to
the
regular
scheme
W
[which
yields
a
Cartier
divisor
on
W
]
and
then
pushing
forward
via
W
→
V
[which
multiplies
the
original
divisor
on
V
by
the
degree
of
the
morphism
W
→
V
].
To
verify
the
portion
of
assertion
(iii)
concerning
étale
fundamental
groups,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
X,
V
,
and
W
are
strictly
henselian,
and
that
the
morphism
V
→
X
is
an
isomorphism.
Now
by
Zariski-Nagata
purity
[i.e.,
the
classical
non-logarithmic
version
of
the
“log
purity
[1]
∼
theorem”
quoted
in
§2],
it
follows
that
π1
(UW
)
→
π1
(W
)
=
{1}.
On
the
other
THE
PROFINITE
FUNDAMENTAL
GROUPS

CONFIGURATION
SPACES
33
hand,
since
the
morphism
W
→
X
is
ﬁnite,
it
follows
that
the
natural
morphism
[1]
[1]
[1]
{1}
=
π1
(UW
)
→
π1
(UX
)
has
open
image,
hence
that
π1
(UX
)
is
ﬁnite.
Thus,
our
assumption
that
G
is
torsion-free
implies
that
φ
is
trivial.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii).
To
verify
assertion
(iv),
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
assertion
(iv)
holds
when
X
is
smooth
over
k.
Indeed,
in
this
case,
by
applying
noetherian
induction
to
F
and
possibly
base-changing
to
a
ﬁnite
inseparable
extension
of
k,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
F
is
smooth
over
k;
but
then
the
content
of
assertion
(iv)
is
well-known
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Milne],
p.
244,
Remark
5.4,
(b)].
In
the
case
of
arbitrary
def
X
log
,
we
argue
as
follows:
Write
ι
:
XF
=
X\F
→
X
for
the
natural
inclusion.
Then
[by
applying
a
well-known
exact
sequence
in
étale
cohomology]
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
Rj
ιét,∗
(Ql
)
=
0
for
0
<
j
≤
2n
−
1.
Sincewe
have
already
veriﬁed
assertion
(iv)
for
k-smooth
X,
we
may
assume
that
F
UX
=
∅.
In
particular,
it
suﬃces
[cf.
[Milne],
p.
88,
Theorem
1.15]
to
verify,
for
an
arbitrary
strictly
henselization
V
of
V
at
a
closed
point
of
V
,
that
H
j
(V
F
,
Ql
)
=
0
for
0
<
j
≤
2n
−
1
def
[where
we
write
V
F
=
XF
×X
V
].
On
the
other
hand,
let
us
observe
that
since
def
def
log
log
→
V
log
is
Kummer
log
étale,
it
follows
ζ
log
:
W
log
F
=
V
F
×V
W
F
=
V
F
×V
V
that
one
may
deﬁne
a
“trace
morphism”
ζét,∗
((Ql
)W
F
)
→
(Ql
)V
F
[where
we
use
the
subscripts
“W
F
”,
“V
F
”
to
denote
the
constant
sheaf
on
W
F
,
∗
V
F
]
that
restricts,
relative
to
ζét
,
to
multiplication
by
the
degree
deg(ζ)
of
ζ
on
(Ql
)V
F
.
[Indeed,
this
is
immediate
for
the
restriction
ζU
:
UW
F
→
UV
F
to
the
respective
interiors,
since
this
restriction
is
ﬁnite
étale.
On
the
other
hand,
since
V
F
∼
is
normal,
we
have
a
natural
isomorphism
(Ql
)V
F
→
θ∗
θ
∗
((Ql
)V
F
),
where
we
write
θ
:
UV
F
→
V
F
for
the
natural
inclusion
of
the
interior.
Thus,
we
obtain
a
trace
morphism
as
desired
by
restricting
to
the
interiors,
applying
the
trace
morphism
on
the
interiors,
and
then
applying
this
natural
isomorphism.]
Thus,
by
taking
étale
cohomology,
one
obtains
a
trace
morphism
τ
:
H
j
(W
F
,
Ql
)
→
H
j
(V
F
,
Ql
)
such
that
the
composite
τ
◦
ρ
with
the
restriction
morphism
ρ
:
H
j
(V
F
,
Ql
)
→
H
j
(W
F
,
Ql
)
is
equal
to
multiplication
by
deg(ζ)
on
H
j
(V
F
,
Ql
).
Since,
moreover,
we
have
already
veriﬁed
assertion
(iv)
for
k-smooth
X,
it
follows
that
H
j
(W
F
,
Ql
)
=
0
for
0
<
j
≤
2n
−
1,
hence
that
H
j
(V
F
,
Ql
)
=
0
for
0
<
j
≤
2n
−
1,
as
desired.
[1]
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(v).
When
X
=
UX
[so
X,
DX
are
smooth
over
k],
assertion
(v)
follows
immediately
by
applying
the
well-known
Gysin
sequence
in
étale
cohomology

e.g.,
[Milne],

Remark

We

in

that

is
false
for

Indeed,
such
an

appears
in
the
Remark

Now
we
return
to
our
discussion
of
conﬁguration
spaces.
Let

of

over
an
algebraically

and
E
for
the

Znlog
[cf.

Thus,
Xn
may
be
identiﬁed
with

we
observe
that
the

implies
[in

that

For

The

is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions
[cf.
also
[Milne],
p.
276,
Theorem
11.1,
(a)].
Next,
we
consider
log-prime
.
Since
n
=

it
follows
immediately
from
the
the
case
n
=

Let

that

a

étale
morphism
of
Dj

the
diagonal
of

In

it
follows
that
we
may
restrict
the
above
linear

to
Dj
to
obtain
a
linear

∼

[cf.
[Milne],
p.
276,
Theorem

Moreover,
since
the
class
ηj
|Dj

the
pull-back
to
Dj
of
some
Q×
l
-multiple
of
the
fundamental
class

we
thus
conclude

that

us
observe
that,
for

the

Thus,
if
we
identify

by
the
natural
action
of
Γ
on
Hét

∼
with

then
we
conclude

independent

the

ηj

i

hence
that
the
element
cj

Ql
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
j
among
all
Γ-conjugates

But
this
implies
that
the
linear
relation

as
the
pull-back
to

That
is
to
say,
we
may
assume
without

that

But
then
the
Ql

independence
of
the
unique
log-prime

ηΔ

the
two
ﬁber

follows,
for

from
the
[easily

non-singularity

we
assume
that

Let

i.e.,
which
projects
to
a

Then
the
covering
W

log
determines
a

that
is
to
say,
Dj
appears
as
a

that
arises
in
the
case
“n

Moreover,
it
follows
immediately
from
Lemma

that
log

In
particular,
by
restricting
the

ηi

Dj

it
follows
by
applying

(ii)

[i.e.,

Thus,
by

we
conclude

Now
to
complete

it
suﬃces
to
show
that

it
follows
that

Since

it
thus
follows
from

[i.e.,

by
abuse
of
notation,
we
use
notation
for

to
denote
the
corresponding
log
schemes
with

In

it
follows
immediately
from
the
fact
that
the
log
structure
of
(Xn∗
)log
arises
from
a
divisor
with
normal
crossings
that
(Y

)log
is
log
smooth
over

and
strongly
Qregular.
Thus,
by
Proposition
5.2,
(iii)
[which
is
applicable
since
(Y
∗
)log
is
log
regular
and
weakly
Q-regular],
it
follows
that,
to
complete
the
proof
of
assertion
(i),
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
φ
factors
through
the
natural
surjection
π1
(Y
)

π1
(W
).
Next,
we
claim
that
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
G
is
abelian.
Indeed,
to
show
that
φ
factors
through
the
natural
surjection
π1
(Y
)

π1
(W
),
it
suﬃces
[by
Zariski-Nagata
purity,
since
W
,
DW
are
smooth
over
k]
to
show
that
that
φ(ξ)
=
1
for
each
element
ξ
∈
π1
(Y
)
of
the
inertia
group
of
an
irreducible
divisor
of
DW
=
W
\Y
.
Let
Ξ
⊆
π1
(Y
)
be
the
closed
subgroup
topologically
generated
by
ξ;
suppose
that
φ(Ξ)
=
{1}.
Then
[cf.
the
argument
applied
at
the
beginning
of
the
proof
of
Theorem
1.5]
there
exists
an
open
subgroup
Gξ
⊆
G
containing
φ(Ξ)
such
that
φ(Ξ)
[i.e.,
Ξ]
has
nontrivial
image
in
Gab
ξ
.
On
the
other
hand,
by
applying
assertion
(i)
to
the
situation
where
we
replace
Y
by
the
ﬁnite
étale
covering
Yξ
→
Y
determined
[via
φ]
by
the
open
subgroup
Gξ
⊆
G,
replace
G
by
Gab
ξ
,
and
replace
W
by
the
normalization
Wξ
of
W
in
Yξ
[where
we
note
that
ξ
∈
π1
(Yξ
)
still
satisﬁes
the
property
of
being
an
element
of
an
inertia
group
of
an
irreducible
divisor
of
Wξ
\Yξ
],
we
conclude
that
Ξ
has
trivial
image
in
Gab
ξ
,
a
contradiction.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
claim.
Thus,
[cf.
the
proof
of
Theorem
4.7]
it
suﬃces
to
verify
assertion
(i)
in
the
case
where
G
=
Zl
,
for
some
prime
number
l.
But
in
this
case,
the
fact
that
the
given
homomorphism
π1
(Y
)
=
π1
(UW
)
→
G
factors
through
π1
(UW
)

π1
(W
)
follows
immediately
from
the
exact
sequence
of
Proposition
5.2,
(v),
in
light
of
the
Ql
-linear
independence
asserted
in
Lemma
5.5,
(i).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
Write
Y
†
→
Pn
for
the
normalization
of
Pn
(⊇
Xn
)
in
Y
.
Since
Y
∗
is
normal
and
maps
to
Xn∗
,
hence
to
Pn
,
we
thus
obtain
a
birational
morphism
Y
∗
→
Y
†
.
Since
the
morphism
Xn∗
→
Pn
is
proper,
it
thus
follows
that
the
morphism
Y
∗
→
Y
†
is
proper.
On
the
other
hand,
since
Y
→
Xn
arises
from
a
product-theoretic
open
subgroup
of
π1
(Xn
),
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
Y
†
is
smooth
over
k,
and
that
the
kernel
of
the
natural
surjection
π1
(Y
)
→
π1
(Y
†
)
is
product-theoretic.
In
particular,
by
Zariski-Nagata
purity
[i.e.,
the
classical
non-logarithmic
version
of
the
“log
purity
theorem”
quoted
above],
we
conclude
that
the
natural
surjection
π1
(Y
∗
)

π1
(Y
†
)
is
an
isomorphism.
But
this
implies
that
the
given
homomorphism
π1
(Y
)
→
G
factors
through
the
natural
surjection
π1
(Y
)

π1
(Y
†
),
hence,
in
particular,
is
product-theoretic.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).

Remark
5.6.1.
Theorem
5.6,
(ii),
generalizes
Theorem
4.7,
in
the
case
of
proper
hyperbolic
curves,
to
the
case
where
“G”
is
not
necessarily
pro-solvable.
This
is
40

AND

possible
precisely
because,
unlike
the
theory
of
§4,
the
theory
of
the
present
§5
is
applicable
to
coverings
of
conﬁguration
spaces
that
are
not
necessarily
producttheoretic
[cf.
the
reduction
in
the
proof
of
Theorem
5.6,
(i),
to
the
case
where
G
is
abelian].
Remark
5.6.2.
In
an
earlier
version
of
the
present
manuscript,
Theorem
5.6
was
stated
in
a
form
that
applied
to
aﬃne
hyperbolic
curves
of
genus
≥
2
as
well.
In
fact,
however,
the
proof
given
for
aﬃne
curves
was
found
to
contain
a
gap
which
the
authors
were
unable
to
repair.
Nevertheless,
although
such
a
gap
exists
for
the
analogue
of
Theorem
5.6,
(i),
for
aﬃne
hyperbolic
curves,
this
gap
does
not
appear
when
the
covering
Y
→
Xn
of
Theorem
5.6
is
assumed
to
be
product-theoretic
[i.e.,
the
situation
of
Theorem
5.6,
(ii)],
under
the
further
assumption
that
G
be
pro-solvable
[cf.
Remark
5.6.1].
In
particular,
it
is
a
routine
task
to
modify
the
argument
given
in
the
present
§5
so
as
to
yield
a
proof
of
Theorem
5.6,
(ii)
[under
the
further
assumption
that
G
be
pro-solvable]
—
i.e.,
a
new
proof
of
Theorem
4.7
—
for
arbitrary
hyperbolic
curves
of
genus
≥
2.
Remark
5.6.3.
It
is
not
clear
to
the
authors
at
the
time
of
writing
whether
or
not
one
should
expect
the
analogue
of
Theorem
5.6
to
hold
for
aﬃne
hyperbolic
curves.
Nevertheless,
one
way
to
think
about
the
“extendability
of
coverings”
property
discussed
in
Theorem
5.6
is
the
following:
This
property
holds
[by
Theorem
5.6]
for
the
“tautological
aﬃne
curve”
with
a
given
ﬁxed
hyperbolic
compactiﬁcation
—
i.e.,
the
tautological
aﬃne
curve
over
a
conﬁguration
space
associated
to
a
proper
hyperbolic
curve.
That
is
to
say,
it
may
be
the
case
that
this
sort
of
special
property
only
holds
for
such
aﬃne
curves
with
“universal/tautological
cusps”
and
not
for
aﬃne
curves
whose
cusps
are
“non-tautological”.
Corollary
5.7.
(Non-existence
of
Generic
Units)
In
the
notation
of
Theorem
5.6,
let
us
ﬁx
a
projection
morphism
def
φX
:
Xn
→
B
=
Xn−1
of
length
1,
which
allows
us
to
regard
Xn
as
a
family
of
hyperbolic
curves
over
B.
Denote
the
[scheme
determined
by
the]
generic
point
of
B
by
η;
write
k(η)
for
def
the
residue
ﬁeld
of
η,
X
=
Xn
×B
η.
Let
k(η

)
be
an
arbitrary
ﬁeld
extension
of
k(η),
η

→
η
the
resulting
morphism
of
schemes,
Y
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
η

,
and
def
Y
→
Xη
=
X
×η
η

=
Xn
×B
η

×
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
over
η

.
Then
every
unit
u
∈
Γ(Y,
OY
)
on
Y
is
constant,

i.e.,
is
contained
in
the
image
of
k(η
)
in
OY
.
Proof.
One
reduces
immediately
by
well-known
elementary
algebraic
geometry
arguments
[i.e.,
replacing
k(η

)
by
a
ﬁnitely
generated
ﬁeld
extension
of
k(η),
extending
Y
→
Xη
over
some
variety
that
admits
k(η

)
as
its
function
ﬁeld,
and

restricting
to
a
closed
point
of
this
variety]
to
the
case
where
the
morphism
η

→
η
is
ﬁnite
étale.
Now
let
us
observe
that
by
the
exact
sequence
of
Proposition
2.2,
(i),
it
follows
that,
after
possibly
replacing
Y
by
an
appropriate
connected
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
Y,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
there
exists
a
commutative
diagram
Y
−→
Xn
⏐
⏐
⏐
⏐
C
−→
B
in
which
the
horizontal
arrows
are
connected
ﬁnite
étale
coverings;
the
vertical
arrows
are
families
of
hyperbolic
curves;
the
divisor
of
cusps
DY
⊆
Y
in
the
[relative,
i.e.,
over
C]
compactiﬁcation
Y
→
C
of
Y
→
C
forms
a
split
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
def
def
C;
the
covering
Y
→
X
factors
through
YηC
=
Y
×C
ηC
[where
ηC
=
C
×B
η]
in
such
a
way
that
the
induced
covering
Y
→
YηC
is
obtained
by
base-changing
the
curve
YηC
over
ηC
via
a
morphism
η

→
ηC
.
In
particular,
since
the
divisor
of
zeroes
and
poles
of
u
on
the
compactiﬁcation
of
the
hyperbolic
curve
Y
descends
[by
our
“splitness”
assumption
on
DY
]
to
a
divisor
on
the
compactiﬁcation
of
the
hyperbolic
curve
YηC
,
it
follows
immediately
that
u
is
constant
if
and
only
if
its
norm
relative
to
this
covering
Y
→
YηC
[which
forms
a
unit
on
YηC
]
is
constant.
Thus,
in
summary,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
Y
=
YηC
,
and
that
u
is
a
unit
on
YηC
.
Now
since
u
may
be
regarded
as
a
rational
function
on
Y
,
the
divisor
of
zeroes
and
poles
of
this
rational
function
on
Y
may
be
written
in
the
form
Dcusp
+
Dbase
—
where
Dcusp
is
a
divisor
supported
on
DY
;
Dbase
is
a
divisor
on
Y
that
arises
as
base
on
C.
In
particular,
we
obtain
a
relation
the
pull-back
to
Y
of
a
divisor
DC
2
0
=
c(Dcusp
)
+
c(Dbase
)
∈
Hét
(Y
,
Ql
(1))
—
where
l
is
a
prime
number;
we
write
c(−)
for
the
Chern
class
of
the
line
bundle
determined
by
a
divisor
on
a
k-smooth
scheme
[such
as
Y
,
Y
,
C].
Next,
let
us
pull-back
this
relation
via
a
section
s
:
C
→
Y
whose
image
Ds
is
contained
in
DY
.
This
yields
a
relation
base
2
λ
·
s∗
(c(Ds
))
=
s∗
(c(Dbase
))
=
c(DC
)
∈
Hét
(C,
Ql
(1))
for
some
λ
∈
Ql
.
On
the
other
hand,
let
us
observe
that,
relative
to
the
notation
of
the
discussion
preceding
Theorem
5.6,
if
we
take
UW
→
UV
to
be
the
covering
Y
→
Xn
,
then
Y
may
be
regarded
as
an
open
subscheme
of
W
,
and
Ds
⊆
Y
as
a
log-prime
divisor
of
W
.
From
this
point
of
view,
it
follows
from
Lemma
5.4,
(ii),
that
s∗
(c(Ds
))
is
a
Ql
-multiple
of
the
pull-back
to
C
via
C
→
B
=
Xn−1
of
a
ﬁber
42
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
AND

base
class
on
B
=
Xn−1
.
In
particular,
we
conclude
that
c(DC
)
is
a
Ql
-multiple
of
the
2
(Y
,
Ql
(1))
pull-back
to
C
of
a
ﬁber
class
on
B
=
Xn−1
,
hence
that
c(Dbase
)
∈
Hét
is
a
Ql
-multiple
of
the
pull-back
to
Y
⊆
W
of
a
ﬁber
class
on
W
.
2
(Y
,
Ql
(1))
Thus,
in
summary,
the
relation
0
=
c(Dcusp
)
+
c(Dbase
)
in
Hét
constitutes
a
Ql
-linear
relation
between
certain
log-prime
classes
[i.e.,
c(Dcusp
)]
and
certain
ﬁber
classes
[i.e.,
c(Dbase
)]
on
Y
.
Since
[it
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions
that]
the
complement
of
Y
in
W
is
a
[disjoint!]
union
of
certain
log-prime
divisors
on
W
,
the
description
of
the
kernel
of
the
restriction
map
2
2
(W,
Ql
(1))
→
Hét
(Y
,
Ql
(1))
given
in
the
exact
sequence
of
Proposition
5.2,
(v),
Hét
2
implies
that
this
Ql
-linear
relation
0
=
c(Dcusp
)
+
c(Dbase
)
in
Hét
(Y
,
Ql
(1))
arises
2
from
some
Ql
-linear
relation
in
Hét
(W,
Ql
(1))
obtained
by
appending
some
Ql
linear
combination
of
the
log-prime
classes
arising
from
the
log-prime
divisors
in
the
complement
W
\Y
.
On
the
other
hand,
by
the
Ql
-linear
independence
asserted
in
Lemma
5.5,
(i),
the
coeﬃcients
of
such
a
Ql
-linear
relation
necessarily
vanish.
In
particular,
since
Dcusp
is
a
Z-linear
combination
of
log-prime
divisors
of
W
that
lie
in
Y
,
we
thus
conclude
that
the
coeﬃcients
∈
Z
of
this
Z-linear
combination
vanish,
i.e.,
that
Dcusp
=
0.
But
this
amounts
precisely
to
the
assertion
that
the
unit
u
is
constant.
This
completes
the
proof
of
Corollary
5.7.

Section
6:
Nearly
Abelian
Groups
In
the
present
§6,
we
discuss
another
approach,
based
on
the
notion
of
a
“nearly
abelian”
proﬁnite
group,
to
verifying
the
group-theoreticity
of
the
various
ﬁber
subgroups
associated
to
a
conﬁguration
space
group.
Deﬁnition
6.1.
We
shall
say
that
a
proﬁnite
group
G
is
nearly
abelian
if
it
admits
a
normal
closed
subgroup
N
⊆
G
which
is
topologically
normally
generated
by
a
single
element
∈
G
such
that
G/N
is
almost
abelian.
Proposition
6.2.
(Nearly
Abelian
Surface
Groups)
Let
C
be
a
nontrivial
full
formation.
Then
a
pro-C
surface
group
Π
is
nearly
abelian
if
and
only
if
it
is
a
free
pro-C
group
on
two
generators
—
i.e.,
it
arises
from
a
hyperbolic
curve
which
is
either
of
type
(0,
3)
or
of
type
(1,
1)
[cf.
Remark
1.2.2].
Proof.
Since
the
suﬃciency
of
the
condition
given
in
the
statement
of
Proposition
6.2
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
the
necessity
of
this
condition.
Thus,
we
suppose
that
Π
is
nearly
abelian.
Now
observe
that
for
any
l
∈
ΣC
,
the
maximal
pro-l
quotient
of
Π
is
again
a
nearly
abelian
[pro-l]
surface
group.
Thus,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
C
is
primary.
Write
ab
def
def
def
ΣC
=
{l};
Π
=
Π/[Π,
[Π,
Π]];
Π1
=
Π
∼
=
Πab
;
Π2
=
[Π,
Π]
⊆
Π.
Thus,
we
have
an
exact
sequence
1
→
Π2
→
Π
→
Π1
→
1
THE
PROFINITE
FUNDAMENTAL
GROUPS
OF
CONFIGURATION
SPACES
43
and
a
surjection
∧2
Π1

Π2
.
Here,
we
regard
Π1
,
Π2
as
ﬁnitely
generated
free
Zl
-modules.
Note
[cf.
Remark
1.2.2]
that
if
Π1
is
of
rank
d,
then
Π2
is
of
rank
1
2
d(d
−
1)
−
,
where

=
0
if
Π
is
open,
and

=
1
if
Π
is
closed.
Also,
we
observe
that
d
≥
2
if

=
0,
and
d
≥
4
if

=
1
[cf.
Remark
1.2.2].
Thus,
to
complete
the
proof
of
Proposition
6.2,
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
d
=
2.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
Π
is
also
nearly
abelian.
Thus,
there
exists
an
element
γ
∈
Π
such
that
if
we
write
N
⊆
Π
for
the
subgroup
topologically
normally
generated
by
γ,
then
Π/N
is
almost
abelian.
In
particular,
[since
the
commutator
subgroup
of
any
open

subgroup
of
Π
forms
an
open
subgroup
of
Π2
]
it
follows
immediately
that
N
Π2
⊆
Π
forms
an
open

subgroup
of
Π2
—
i.e.,
a
Zl
-module
of
the
same
rank
as
Π2
.
If
γ
∈
Π2
,
then
N
Π2
=
N
is
of
rank
≤
1,
so
we
obtain
that
1
2
d(d
−1)
−
≤
1,
i.e.,
d(d
−1)
≤
2(1
+)
≤
4,
so
d
≤
2,
i.e.,
d
=
2,
as
desired.
Thus,
it
remains

to
consider
the
case
where
γ
∈
Π2
.
In
this
case,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
N
Π2
⊆
Π2
is
given
by
the
image
of
the
morphism
[γ,
−]
:
Π1
→
Π2
given
by
forming
the
commutator
with
γ.
Since
this
morphism
clearly
vanishes
on
γ,
its
image
is
of
rank
≤
d
−
1.
Thus,
we
conclude
that
d−1
≥
1
d(d
−
1)
−

2
—
i.e.,
that
2
·

≥
(d
−
1)(d
−
2),
which
implies
that
d
≤
2
if

=
0,
and
d
≤
3
if

=
1.
But
this
is
enough
to
conclude
that
d
=
2
[and

=
0].
This
completes
the
proof
of
Proposition
6.2.

Corollary
6.3.
(Group-theoreticity
of
Projections
of
Conﬁguration
Spaces
II)
Let
C
be
a
PT-formation.
For
ξ
=
α,
β,
let
X
ξ
be
a
hyperbolic
curve
whose
type
is
neither
(0,
3)
nor
(1,
1)
over
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
kξ
of

zero;

associated

;
Πξ
=

Eξ
the

set
of

ξ
.
Let
∼
γ
:
Πα
→
Πβ
be
an
isomorphism
of
proﬁnite
groups.
Then
γ
induces
a
bijection
σ
:
∼
Eα
→
Eβ
[so
nα
=
nβ
]
such
that
γ(Fα
)
=
Fβ
for
all
ﬁber
subgroups
Fα

Fβ
⊆
Πβ
,
whose
respective
proﬁles
Eα
⊆
Eα
,
Eβ
⊆
Eβ
correspond
via
σ.
Proof.
Just
as
in
the
proof
of
Corollary
4.8,
to
complete
the
proof
of
Corollary
6.3,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
the
image
via
γ
of
any
ﬁber
subgroup
of

of
co-length
44

AND

one
is
contained
in
a
ﬁber
subgroup
of
Πβ
of
co-length
one.
For
j
=
1,
.
.
.
,
nξ
,
let
us
write
Kjξ
⊆
Πξ
for
the
ﬁber
subgroup
⊆
Πξ
of
co-length
one
with
co-proﬁle
given
by
the
element
of
Eξ
labeled
by
j,
and
Jjξ
⊆
Πξ
for
the
ﬁber
subgroup
⊆
Πξ
of
length
one
with
proﬁle
given
by
the
element
of
Eξ
labeled
by
j.
Thus,
[cf.
Proposition
2.4,
(vi)]
to
complete
the
proof
of
Corollary
6.3,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
the
following
statement
[in
general]:
For
each
i
∈
Eα
,
there
exists
a
j
∈
Eβ
such
that
Jjβ
⊆
γ(Kiα
)
for
all
j

∈
Eβ
such
that
j

=
j.
To
verify
this
statement,
we
reason
as
follows:
Write
∼
φ
:
Πβ
→
Πα

G
=
Πα
/Kiα
def
for
the
surjection
determined
by
γ
−1
.
Then
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
there
do
not
exist
two
distinct
elements
j1
,
j2
∈
Eβ
such
that
Jjβ1
,
Jjβ2
have
nontrivial
image
under
φ.
Thus,
let
us
suppose
that
the
images
J1
,
J2
of
Jjβ1
,
Jjβ2
under
φ
are
nontrivial.
Since
Jjβ1
,
Jjβ2
are
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated
normal
closed
subgroups
of
Πβ
,
it
follows
from
Theorem
1.5
that
J1
,
J2
are
open
in
G
[cf.
Remark
3.3.2].
Moreover,
by
Proposition
2.4,
(v),
it
follows
that
there
exists
a
normal
closed
subgroup
N
⊆
G
that
is
topologically
normally
generated
by
a
single
element
such
that
the
images
of
J1
,
J2
in
G/N
commute.
Thus,
G/N
contains
an
abelian
open
subgroup,
i.e.,
is
almost
abelian.
On
the
other
hand,
since
Kiα
⊆
Πα
is
a
ﬁber
subgroup
of
co-length
one,
it
follows
that
G
=
Πα
/Kiα
is
a
surface
group.
Thus,
in
summary,
we
conclude
that
G
is
a
nearly
abelian
surface
group,
which,
by
Proposition
6.2,
contradicts
our
hypothesis
concerning
the
type
of
the
hyperbolic
curve
X
α
.
This
completes
the
proof
of
Corollary
6.3.

Remark
6.3.1.
Unlike
the
case
with
Corollary
4.8,
it
seems
unrealistic
at
the
time
of
writing
to
extend
the
technique
of
the
proof
of
Corollary
6.3
to
the
case
of
arbitrary
product-theoretic
open
subgroups
⊆
π1C
(Xnξ
ξ
)
[cf.
Corollary
4.8],
since
this
would
require
an
analogue
of
Proposition
6.2
for
surface
groups
that
become
almost
abelian
after
forming
the
quotient
by
a
subgroup
topologically
normally
generated
by
a
very
large
number
of
elements
[roughly,
on
the
order
of
the
index
of
the
product-theoretic
open
subgroups
under
consideration].

Section
7:
A
Discrete
Analogue
In
the
present
§7,
we
discuss
various
consequences
of
Theorems
4.7,
5.6
and
Corollaries
4.8,
6.3
[cf.
Corollaries
7.3,
7.4
below]
for
the
topological
fundamental
groups
of
conﬁguration
spaces
over
the
complex
number
ﬁeld
C.
In
the
following
discussion,
if
Z
is
a
connected
scheme
of
ﬁnite
type
over
C,
then
we
shall
use
the
notation
π1top
(Z)
to
denote
the
“topological
fundamental
group”
[i.e.,
the
fundamental
group
in
the
usual
sense
of
algebraic
topology],
for
some
choice
of
basepoint,
of
the
topological
space
of
C-rational
points
Z(C)
[equipped
with
the
topology
determined
by
the
topology
of
C].
Let
X
be
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
C,
n
≥
1
an
integer.
Write
Xn
⊆
Pn
for
the
n-th
conﬁguration
space
associated
to
X
[cf.
the
notation
of
Deﬁnition
2.1,
(i)].
Since
the
complement
in
a
connected
complex
manifold
of
any
submanifold
of
[complex]
codimension
≥
1
is
clearly
connected,
it
thus
follows
that
the
inclusion
Xn
→
Pn
induces
a
natural
surjection
π1top
(Xn
)

π1top
(Pn
).
The
following
“discrete
analogue”
of
[a
certain
portion
of]
Proposition
2.2
is
well-known:
Proposition
7.1.
(Topological
Fundamental
Groups
of
Conﬁguration
Spaces)
In
the
notation
of
the
above
discussion:
(i)
Any
projection
morphism
Xn
→
Xn−1
of
length
one
determines
a
natural
exact
sequence
1
→
π1top
((Xn
)x
)
→
π1top
(Xn
)
→
π1top
(Xn−1
)
→
1
def
[where
we
write
X0
=
Spec(C);
x
is
a
C-valued
geometric
point
of
Xn−1
].
(ii)
The
natural
morphism
π1top
(Xn
)
→
π1
(Xn
)
to
the
étale
fundamental
group
π1
(Xn
)
is
injective,
i.e.,
π1top
(Xn
)
is
residually
ﬁnite.
Proof.
Assertion
(i)
is
discussed,
for
instance,
in
[Birm],
Theorem
1.4.
To
verify
assertion
(ii),
observe
that
[by
induction
on
n]
it
follows
from
the
exact
sequences
of
assertion
(i)
and
the
analogue
of
assertion
(i)
for
π1
(Xn
)
[cf.
Proposition
2.2,
(i)],
that
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
n
=
1.
Now
let
us
recall
that
π1top
(X)
may
be
embedded
[by
considering
the
well-known
uniformization
of
X(C)
by
the
upper
half-plane]
into
SL2
(R)/{±1}.
That
is
to
say,
π1top
(X)
is
a
“ﬁnitely
46

MOCHIZUKI
AND

generated
linear
group”,
so
the
desired
residual-ﬁniteness
follows
from
a
well-known
theorem
of
Mal’cev
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Wehr],
Theorem
4.2].

Deﬁnition
7.2.
(i)
We
shall
refer
to
a

via


π1top

of
a

as
the

E

.
Remark
7.2.1.
Note
that
by
the
injectivity
of
Proposition
7.1,
(ii),
it
follows
immediately
that
the
ﬁber
subgroup
of
proﬁle
E

of
π1top
(Xn

[cf.
the
notation
of
Deﬁnition

is
equal
to

7.3.
(Discrete
Extendability

Let
X
be
a
hyperbolic
curve
of
genus
≥
2

C;
n
≥

G
a

torsion-free

φ
:
π1top

G
a

[of

Then:
(i)
Suppose
that
X
is
proper.
Then
the

φ
factors
uniquely
through
the
natural

by

(ii)
Suppose
that
one
of
the
following
holds:
(a)
X
is
proper;
(b)
G
is
prosolvable.
Also,
let
us
suppose
that
the
covering
Y
→
Xn
arises
from
a
producttheoretic
subgroup
of
ﬁnite
index
of
π1top

Then
the

of
φ
is

Proof.
Indeed,
since
the

necessarily
factors
through
the

the
conclusion
of
assertion
(i)
(respectively,
assertion
(ii)
when

when

follows
immediately
from
