COMMENTS ON “CATEGORICAL REPRESENTATION
OF LOCALLY NOETHERIAN LOG SCHEMES”

(1.) The theory exposed in §2 contains errors, as follows:
· the necessity asserted in Proposition 2.3, is false;
· the isomorphism asserted [unfortunately, without an explicit proof!] in
Lemma 2.6, (ii), is false.
At the level of main results of the present paper, these errors in the theory of §2,
do not aﬀect the proof of Theorem A given in §1, but they do aﬀect the proof — although not the validity! — of Theorem B. This result Theorem B is given a correct
proof in [MnLgSch], §3 [cf. [MnLgSch], Theorem 3.8, (iii)]. Also, the errors referred
to above are discussed in more detail in [MnLgSch], Example 0.3; [MnLgSch], Remark 1.4.1. At the level of main results of papers of the author subsequent to the
present paper, the only place where the errors in the theory of §2 have an aﬀect is
in the portion of the proof of the main result of [ArLgSch] [i.e., [ArLgSch], Theorem
5.1] that involves the theory of [ArLgSch], §4. The aﬀected portions of [ArLgSch],
§4, are discussed in more detail in the introduction to [MnLgSch], §4. The main
result [ArLgSch], Theorem 5.1, of [ArLgSch] is given a correct proof in [MnLgSch],
§4 [cf. [MnLgSch], Theorem 4.8, (iv)]. More details on the aﬀected portions of the
present paper, as well as of [ArLgSch], may be found in the Appendix to [MnLgSch].
(2.) In the ﬁrst paragraph of the proof of Lemma 2.5, the notation “Q ∈ VZ ” should
read “Q ⊆ VZ ”.
(3.) In the second sentence of the statement of Proposition 2.7, the phrase “(necessarily uniquely!) though” should read “(necessarily uniquely!) through”. In the
second paragraph of the proof of Proposition 2.7, the phrase “(uniquely) though”
should read “(uniquely) through”.
(4.) In the discussion immediately following the display in the statement of Corollary 2.12, (ii), the notation “Sch(X log )” should read “Schlog (X log )”.
(5.) In Lemma 2.16, (iii), the phrase “a monomorphism” should read “a schemelike monomorphism”.
