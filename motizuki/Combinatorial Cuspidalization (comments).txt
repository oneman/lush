COMMENTS ON “ON THE COMBINATORIAL
CUSPIDALIZATION OF HYPERBOLIC CURVES”

(1.) In lines 4–5 of the third paragraph of the discussion entitled “The Étale Fundamental Group of a Log Scheme” in §0, the phrase “unramiﬁed over R◦ ” should
read “unramiﬁed over US◦ ”.
(2.) In Fig. 1, the subscripts “b”, “c” in the notation “Fb ”, “Fc ” should be reversed.
(3.) In the statement of Proposition 1.3, (i), the phrase “the set of divisors Dnver
which” should read “the set of divisors which”; the notation “δ ∈ Dnhor ” should
read “δ ∈ Dnver ”.
(4.) In the statement of Proposition 1.3, (iv), the notation “Dnhor ” should read
“Dnver ”.
(5.) In the ﬁrst paragraph of the proof of Corollary 1.14, the text “First, let us . . .
Now let” should read as follows:
∼

log

First, let us observe that relative to the natural isomorphism Xnlog → (M0,n+3 )k
[cf. Deﬁnition 1.1, (vi)], the divisors of Xn that belong to Dn are prelog
cisely the divisors at inﬁnity of (M0,n+3 )k . [Indeed, this follows imlog

mediately from the well-known geometry of (M0,n+3 )k .] In particular,
log

the automorphisms of (M0,n+3 )k arising from the permutations of the
ordering of the cusps permute the divisors that belong to Dn . Thus,
we conclude that the outer modular symmetries ∈ Out(Πn ) normalize
OutQS (Πn ) = OutFC (Πn )cusp [cf. Proposition 1.3, (vi), (vii)]. Now let

(6.) In Deﬁnition 5.2, (ii), the phrase “of x in U” should read “of x in N ”.
