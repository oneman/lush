THE
PAPER
“ON
THE
COMBINATORIAL
ANABELIAN
GEOMETRY
OF
NODALLY

OUTER
REPRESENTATIONS”

(1.)
The
phrase
“of
VA-type”
that
appears
near
the
beginning
of
Deﬁnition
2.4,
(ii),
should
read
“is
of
VA-type”.
(2.)
There
is
a
slight
[but
substantively
irrelevant]
inaccuracy
in
the
ﬁnal
sentence
of
the
discussion
entitled
“Curves”
in
§0.
A
corrected
version
of
this
ﬁnal
sentence
may
be
given
as
follows:
Then
we
shall
refer
to
as
the
n-th
log
conﬁguration
space
of
X
log
the
log
scheme
log
log
obtained
by
pulling
back
the
(1-)morphism
Mg,r+n
→
Mg,r
given
by
forgetting
log
the
last
n
points
via
the
classifying
(1-)morphism
T
log
→
Mg,r
of
X
log
×S
T
for
some
ﬁnite
étale
covering
T
→
S
[i.e.,
over
which
the
divisor
of
cusps
splits]
of
the
underlying
scheme
S
of
S
log
and
then
descending
[in
the
evident
fashion]
from
def
T
log
=
T
×S
S
log
to
S
log
.

In
the
statement
of
Deﬁnitions
2.10,
(ii);
5.1,
(v),
there
are
references
to
[Mzk4],
Example
2.5,
concerning
the
deﬁnition
of
a
certain
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
of
pro-Σ
PSC-type
determined
by
a
stable
log
curve
over
a
base
[fs]
log
scheme
whose
underlying
scheme
is
the
spectrum
of
a
ﬁeld.
At
ﬁrst
glance,
this
may
appear
to
be
problematic
since
the
“stable
log
curve
over
a
base
log
scheme
whose
underlying
scheme
is
the
spectrum
of
a
ﬁeld”
that
appears
in
[Mzk4],
Example
2.5,
is
subject
to
the
condition
that
the
log
structure
of
this
base
log
scheme
be
of
a
certain
restricted
type.
In
fact,
this
is
not
a
problem,
however,
since
the
construction
of
the
semigraph
of
anabelioids
of
pro-Σ
PSC-type
in
[Mzk4],
Example
2.5,
depends
only
on
the
pointed
stable
curve
over
a
ﬁeld
determined
by
the
given
log
stable
curve
[i.e.,
is
independent
of
the
log
structure
on
the
base
log
scheme].

In
the
second
paragraph
of
the
proof
of
Theorem
4.1,
the
text
“there

“there

At
the
end
of
the
second
sentence
of
Deﬁnition
5.1,
(x),
the
notation
“π1
(UYn
)(Σ)
”
should
read
“π1
(UYn
)Σ
”.

In
the
proof
of
Corollary
5.3,
the
phrase
“graphicity
of
α”
should
read
“graphicity
of
α|Π2/1
”
(2
instances);
the
phrase
“compatibility
of
α2/1
with”
should
read
“compatibility
of
α|Π2/1
with”
(1
instance);
the
notation
α2/1
|Πsub
should
read
α|Πsub
(3
instances).
