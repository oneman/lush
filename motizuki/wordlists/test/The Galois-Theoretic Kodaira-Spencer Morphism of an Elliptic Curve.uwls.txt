Introduction
The
purpose
of
this
paper
is
to
study
in
greater
detail
the
arithmetic
KodairaSpencer
morphism
of
an
elliptic
curve
introduced
in
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX,
in
the
general
context
of
the
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
of
elliptic
curves,
developed
in
[Mzk1-3].
In
particular,
after
correcting
a
minor
error
(cf.
Corollary
1.6)
in
the
construction
of
this
arithmetic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
in
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX,
§3,
we
deﬁne
(cf.
§2.1)
a
slightly
modiﬁed
“Lagrangian”
version
of
this
arithmetic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
which
has
the
following
remarkable
properties:
(1)
This
Lagrangian
arithmetic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
is
free
of
Gaussian
poles
(cf.
Corollary
2.5).
(2)
A
certain
portion
of
the
reduction
modulo
p
of
this
Lagrangian
arithmetic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
may
be
naturally
identiﬁed
with
the
usual
geometric
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
(cf.
Corollary
2.7).
We
recall
that
property
(1)
is
of
substantial
interest
since
it
is
the
Gaussian
poles
that
are
the
main
obstruction
to
applying
the
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
of
elliptic
curves
to
diophantine
geometry
(cf.
the
discussion
of
[Mzk1],
Introduction,
§5.1,
for
more
details).
On
the
other
hand,
property
(2)
is
of
substantial
interest
in
that
Typeset

AMS-TEX

SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
it
shows
quite
deﬁnitively
that
the
analogy
asserted
in
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX,
between
the
arithmetic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
of
the
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
of
elliptic
curves
and
the
usual
geometric
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
of
a
family
of
elliptic
curves
is
not
just
philosophy,
but
rigorous
mathematics!
(cf.
the
Remark
following
Corollary
2.7
for
more
details).
In
fact,
both
properties
(1)
and
(2)
are
essentially
formal
consequences
of
a
property
that
we
refer
to
as
the
“crystalline
nature
of
the
Lagrangian
Galois
action”
(cf.
Theorem
2.4).
Interestingly,
the
theory
of
§2
of
the
present
paper
makes
essential
use
not
only
of
the
theory
of
[Mzk1],
but
also
of
[Mzk2],
[Mzk3].
Unfortunately,
however,
this
Lagrangian
arithmetic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism,
which
is
based
on
a
certain
“Lagrangian
Galois
action,”
can
only
be
deﬁned
when
there
is
a
natural
(rank
one)
multiplicative
subspace
(i.e.,
“weight
1”
subspace)
of
the
Tate
module
of
the
elliptic
curve
in
question.
Since
such
a
subspace
is
wellknown
to
exist
in
a
formal
neighborhood
of
inﬁnity
(of
the
compactiﬁed
moduli
stack
of
elliptic
curves),
we
work
over
such
a
base
in
§2.
Ultimately,
however,
one
would
like
to
carry
out
this
construction
for
elliptic
curves
over
number
ﬁelds.
In
§3,
4,
we
discuss
a
certain
point
of
view
that
suggests
that
this
may
be
possible
—
cf.
especially,
§4,
“Conclusion.”
It
is
the
hope
of
the
author
to
complete
the
construction
motivated
in
§3,4
in
a
future
paper.

the

Section
1:
Galois
Actions
on
the
Torsion
Points
In
this
§,
we
study
various
Galois
actions
on
the
space
of
functions
on
the
set
of
torsion
points
of
an
elliptic
curve.
In
particular,
we
observe
that
these
actions
give
rise
to
a
natural
action
of
the
“algebraic
fundamental
groupoid”
of
the
base
of
a
family
of
elliptic
curves
on
the
scheme
of
torsion
points
over
this
base.
This
action
allows
us
to
correct
an
error
made
in
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX,
in
the
deﬁnition
given
there
of
the
arithmetic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism.
Let
S
log
be
a
ﬁne
noetherian
log
scheme
whose
underlying
scheme
S
is
connected
and
normal.
Write
US
⊆
S
for
the
open
subscheme
where
the
log
structure
is
trivial.
In
the
following
discussion,
we
shall
assume
that
US
=
∅.
Next,
let
us
assume
that
we
are
given
a
log
elliptic
curve
(cf.
§0,
Notations
and
Conventions)
C
log
→
S
log

KODAIRA-SPENCER

(whose
associated
one-dimensional
semi-abelian
scheme
we
denote
by
E
→
S)
and
a
positive
integer
d
≥
1
which
is
generically
invertible
on
S
(i.e.,
invertible
on
a
schematically
dense
open
subscheme
of
S).
Next,
let
us
write
UT
[d−1
]
⊆
E|US
[d−1
]
def
(where
US
[d−1
]
=
US
⊗Z
Z[d−1
])
for
the
kernel
of
the
ﬁnite,
étale
morphism
[d]
:
E|US
[d−1
]
→
E|US
[d−1
]
of
degree
d2
(given
by
multiplication
by
d).
Thus,
UT
[d−1
]
→
US
[d−1
]
is
ﬁnite
étale
of
degree
d2
.
Let
us
write
T
→S
def
for
the
normalization
of
S
in
UT
[d−1
],
UT
=
T
|US
(so
UT
[d−1
]
=
UT
⊗Z
Z[d−1
]).
Also,
let
us
assume
that
we
are
given
a
connected,
normal
scheme
Z
over
S
such
def
def
that
if
we
write
UZ
=
Z|US
,
UZ
[d−1
]
=
UZ
⊗Z
Z[d−1
],
then
UZ
[d−1
]
→
US
[d−1
]
is
ﬁnite
étale
and
Galois;
UZ
[d−1
]
→
US
[d−1
]
dominates
every
connected
component
of
UT
[d−1
];
and
Z
is
the
normalization
of
S
in
UZ
[d−1
].
Next,
we
consider
étale
fundamental
groups.
Write
ΠS
for
the
fundamental
group
π1
(US
[d−1
])
(for
some
choice
of
base-point,
which
we
omit
in
the
notation
since
it
is
irrelevant
to
our
discussion).
Then
since
UZ
[d−1
]
→
US
[d−1
]
is
Galois,
it
follows
that
ΠS
acts
naturally
on
UZ
[d−1
],
hence
also
on
Z
(over
S).
In
particular,
ΠS
acts
naturally
on
the
module
of
d-torsion
points
def
M
=
MorS
(Z,
T
)
(where
we
observe
that,
as
an
abstract
Z-module,
M
∼
=
(Z/dZ)2
).
In
the
following
discussion,
we
shall
think
of
the
action
of
ΠS
on
Z
as
an
action
from
the
right,
and
the
action
of
ΠS
on
OZ
,
M
as
an
action
from
the
left.
Next,
let
us
us
consider
the
OZ
-algebra
def
F
=
Func(M,
OZ
)
of
OZ
-valued
functions
on
the
ﬁnite
set
M
.
Then
observe
that
ΠS
acts
on
F
in
several
diﬀerent
ways,
e.g.,
via
the
action
of
ΠS
on
M
,
via
the
action
of
ΠS
on
OZ
,
etc.
Deﬁnition
1.1.
We
shall
refer
to
the
OZ
-linear
(respectively,
semi-linear,
relative
to
the
action
of
ΠS
on
OZ
)
action
of
ΠS
from
the
right
(respectively,
left)
on
F
induced
by
the
action
of
ΠS
on
M
(respectively,
OZ
)
as
the
point-theoretic
action
4
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
(respectively,
value-theoretic
action)
of
ΠS
on
F.
We
shall
refer
to
the
OZ
-semilinear
action
of
ΠS
on
F
from
the
left
given
by
composing
the
value-theoretic
action
with
the
inverse
of
the
point-theoretic
action
(i.e.,
if
σ
∈
ΠS
,
and
φ
∈
F,
then
σ
maps
φ
to
the
function
M
m
→
σ(φ(σ
−1
m)))
as
the
diagonal
action
of
ΠS
on
F.
We
shall
abbreviate
the
term
“point-theoretic
action”
(respectively,
“valuetheoretic
action”;
“diagonal
action”)
by
the
term
P-action
(respectively,
V-action;
D-action).
Proposition
1.2.
There
is
a
natural
inclusion
ι
:
OT
→
F
of
OS
-algebras
which
induces
an
isomorphism
of
OT
onto
the
subalgebra
of
F
of
ΠS
-invariants
with
respect
to
the
D-action.
Moreover,
this
inclusion
induces
an
isomorphism
∼
(OT
⊗OS
OZ
)norm
→F
(where
the
superscript
“norm”
denotes
the
normalization
of
the
ring
in
parentheses)
which
is
ΠS
-equivariant
with
respect
to
the
tensor
product
of
the
trivial
action
of
ΠS
on
OT
and
the
natural
action
of
ΠS
on
OZ
on
the
left,
and
the
D-action
of
ΠS
on
F
on
the
right.
def
Proof.
It
is
a
tautology
(cf.
the
deﬁnition
M
=
MorS
(Z,
T
))
that
elements
of
M
deﬁne
OS
-algebra
homomorphisms
OT
→
OZ
.
Thus,
if
we
take
the
direct
product
of
these
various
homomorphisms,
then
we
get
an
OS
-algebra
homomorphism
ι
:
OT
→
F
def
(cf.
the
deﬁnition
of
F
—
i.e.,
F
=
Func(M,
OZ
)).
Moreover,
it
is
a
tautology
that
OT
maps
into
the
subalgebra
of
ΠS
-invariants
of
F
relative
to
the
D-action.
Since
OT
and
F
are
both
normal
algebras,
in
order
to
verify
the
remaining
assertions
of
Proposition
1.2,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
these
assertions
hold
over
US
[d−1
].
To
simplify
notation,
we
assume
(just
for
the
remainder
of
this
proof
)
that
S
=
US
[d−1
].
Thus,
T
→
S
and
Z
→
S
are
ﬁnite
étale,
so,
by
(Galois)
étale
descent
(with
respect
to
the
morphism
Z
→
S),
it
follows
that
the
ΠS
-invariants
of
F
form
an
OS
-algebra
OT

,
whose
spectrum
T

over
S
is
ﬁnite
étale
over
S.
Moreover,
T

→
S
factors
(cf.
the
discussion
of
the
preceding
paragraph)
through
T
.
Thus,
since
T

and
T
are
both
ﬁnite
étale
of
degree
equal
to
the
cardinality
of
M
(i.e.,
d2
)
over
S,
we
obtain
that
T

=
T
,
as
desired.
The
fact
that
the
induced
morphism
∼
OT
⊗OS
OZ
→F
is
an
isomorphism
then
follows
from
elementary
properties
of
étale
descent.
This
completes
the
proof.
Next,
we
would
like
to
use
the
V-action
of
ΠS
on
F
to
construct
“some
sort
of
group
action”
on
F
which
descends
to
an
action
on
OT
.
If,
for
instance,
the
V-action
of
ΠS
on
F
were
equivariant
with
respect
to
the
D-action
of
ΠS
on
F,
then
the
V-action
itself
would
deﬁne
an
action
of
ΠS
on
F
that
descends
to
an
GALOIS-THEORETIC
KODAIRA-SPENCER
5
action
on
OT
.
In
fact,
however,
this
sort
of
equivariance
does
not
hold
in
the
naive
sense,
but
only
in
the
following
“twisted
sense”:
First,
let
us
deﬁne
the
proﬁnite
group
with
ΠS
-action
ΓS
as
follows:
We
take
the
underlying
proﬁnite
group
of
ΓS
to
be
ΠS
itself.
The
ΠS
-action
on
ΓS
is
deﬁned
def
to
be
the
action
given
by:
σ(γ)
=
σ
·
γ
·
σ
−1
(for
σ
∈
ΠS
,
γ
∈
ΓS
).
Next,
we
endow
F
with
the
ΓS
-action
deﬁned
by
thinking
of
ΓS
as
ΠS
and
using
the
V-action
of
ΠS
on
F
(cf.
Deﬁnition
1.1).
Then
we
have
the
following:
Proposition
1.3.
The
ΓS
-action
on
F
is
compatible
with
the
ΠS
-actions
on
ΓS
and
F
(where
we
think
of
ΠS
as
acting
on
F
by
the
D-action).
Proof.
Indeed,
if
σ
∈
ΠS
,
γ
∈
ΓS
,
φ
∈
F,
m
∈
M
,
then:


σ
{γ(φ)}
(m)
=
σ
·
{γ(φ)}(σ
−1
·
m)
D
=
σ
·
γ
·
φ(σ

·
m)
=
σ
·
γ
·
σ
−1
·
σ
·
φ(σ
−1
·
m)
=
σ(γ)
·
σ
·
φ(σ
−1
·
m)
=
σ(γ)
·
{σ
D
(φ)}(m)



D
=
σ(γ)
·
{σ
(φ)}
(m)
(where
the
superscript
D
denotes
the
D-action
of
the
group
element
bearing
the
superscript).
This
completes
the
proof.
Let
us
write
Gal(Z/S)
for
the
Galois
group
of
the
Galois
covering
UZ
[d−1
]
→
US
[d−1
].
Then
by
forming
the
quotient
of
Z
by
the
action
of
Gal(Z/S)
in
the
sense
of
stacks,
we
obtain
an
algebraic
stack
SZsk
,
together
with
morphisms
Z
→
SZsk
→
S
where
the
ﬁrst
morphism
is
Galois,
ﬁnite
étale
(with
Galois
group
Gal(Z/S)),
and
the
second
morphism
is
an
isomorphism
over
US
[d−1
].
If
we
let
Z
range
over
all
connected
Galois,
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
S,
the
inverse
limit
of
the
Z
(respectively,
SZsk
)
thus
deﬁnes
a
“pro-scheme”
S
(respectively,
“pro-algebraic
stack”

)
over
S,
together
with
morphisms:

the

is
“Galois,

étale”
(with
Galois

ΠS
)
and
the
second
morphism
is
an
isomorphism
over
US
[d−1

Moreover,
by

the

ΓS

The
action
of
ΓS
on

descends
to
an
action
of
the
algebraic
sk
fundamental
groupoid
Γsk
S
on
T

Proof.
This
follows
immediately
from
Proposition
1.2,
1.3.
Remark.
The
terminology
of
Deﬁnition
1.4
may
be
justiﬁed
as
follows:
First,
let
us
recall
the
well-known
analogy
between
algebraic
fundamental
groups
(such
as
ΠS
)
and
the
usual
topological
fundamental
groups
of
algebraic
topology.
This
analogy
gives
us
the
freedom
to
phrase
our
justiﬁcation
in
the
language
of
topological
fundamental
groups.
Thus,
let
X
be
a
topological
manifold.
Note
that
for
each
point
x
∈
X,
we
obtain
(in
a
natural
way)
a
group:
x
→
π1
(X,
x)
i.e.,
the
fundamental
group
with
base-point
x.
This
correspondence
deﬁnes
a
local
system
of
groups
on
X,
which
is
known
(in
algebraic
topology)
as
the
fundamental
groupoid
of
X.
On
the
other
hand,
there
is
a
well-known
equivalence
of
categories
between
local
systems
of
groups
on
X
and
groups
G
equipped
with
an
action
of
π1
(X,
x)
(given
by
associating
to
such
a
local
system
its
ﬁber
at
x,
together
with
the
“monodromy
action”
of
π1
(X,
x)).
Moreover,
it
is
an
easy
exercise
to
check
that,
relative
to
this
equivalence
of
categories,
the
fundamental
groupoid
corresponds
to
the
“group
with
π1
(X,
x)-action”
deﬁned
by
letting
π1
(X,
x)
act
on
itself
via
conjugation
(cf.
the
deﬁnition
given
above
for
the
ΠS
-action
on
ΓS
).
Thus,
in
summary,
one
may
regard
the
object
Γsk
S
as
the
algebraic
analogue
of
the
fundamental
groupoid.
This
justiﬁes
the
terminology
of
Deﬁnition
1.4.
Remark.
One
other
interesting
observation
relative
to
the
appearance
of
the
algebraic
fundamental
groupoid
(cf.
Deﬁnition
1.4
—
i.e.,
as
opposed
to
group)
in
the
correct
formulation
of
the
arithmetic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
(cf.
Corollary
1.6
below)
is
the
following.
Recall
that
in
the
asserted
analogy
between
the
arithmetic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
of
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX,
and
the
usual
geometric
GALOIS-THEORETIC
KODAIRA-SPENCER
7
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism,
the
Galois
group/fundamental
group(oid)
of
the
base
plays
the
role
of
the
tangent
bundle
of
the
base.
On
the
other
hand,
the
tangent
bundle
of
the
base
(typically)
does
not
admit
a
canonical
global
trivialization,
but
instead
varies
from
point
to
point
—
i.e.,
at
a
given
point,
it
consists
of
inﬁnitesimal
motions
originating
from
that
point.
Thus,
it
is
natural
that
the
arithmetic
analogue
of
the
tangent
bundle
should
be
not
the
“static”
fundamental
group,
but
instead
the
fundamental
groupoid,
which
varies
from
point
to
point,
and
indeed,
at
a
given
point,
consists
of
paths
(which
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“motion”)
originating
from
that
point.
We
are
now
ready
to
apply
the
above
discussion
to
correct
an
error
made
in
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX,
in
the
deﬁnition
given
there
of
the
arithmetic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism:
In
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX,
Theorem
3.3,
and
the
discussion
preceding
it,
it
is
falsely
asserted
that
there
is
a
natural
action
(“with
denominators”)
of
ΠS
on
HDR
(notation
of
loc.
cit.)
arising
from
a
natural
action
of
ΠS
on
T
→
S
(notation
of
the
present
discussion).
Although
this
assertion
does
indeed
hold
if
the
S-scheme
T
happens
to
be
a
disjoint
union
of
copies
of
S,
in
general,
it
is
false.
That
is
to
say,
the
correct
formulation
sk
(not
that
ΠS
acts
on
of
this
assertion
is
that
the
“twisted
object”
Γsk
S
acts
on
T
T
).
Corollary
1.6.
(Correction
to
Error
in
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX,
§3)
The
phrase
“natural
action
of
ΠS
on
...
HDR
”
in
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX,
Theorem
3.3,
should
read
“natural

on

HDR
|S
sk
”
sk
(where
“|sk
S
”
denotes

the
pull-back
via
the
morphism
S
→
S),
and
the
divisor
of
possible
poles
“[η
(d
E)]
+
V
(4)”
should
read
[η

(d
E)]
+
V
(d)
:
In
particular,
the
resulting
“arithmetic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism”
κarith
E
ΠS
→
Filt(HDR
)(S)
((erroneous)
notation
of
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX,
§3)
should
in
fact
be
thought
of
as
a
morphism
sk
:
Γsk
κarith,
S
→
Filt(HDR
)|S

of
sheaves
on
the

It
remains
only
to
remark
that
the
reason
for
the
divisor
“V
(d)”
(i.e.,
the
zero
locus
of
the
regular
function
determined
by
the
integer
d)
is
that
the
integral
structure
on
the
pull-back
to
Z
(notation
of
the
present
discussion)
of
Od
E
diﬀers
8
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
from
that
of
F
(cf.
the
notation
“norm”
appearing
in
Proposition
1.2)
by
a
factor
which
is
bounded
by
the
diﬀerent
of
the
algebra
Od
E
.
Moreover,
the
fact
that
this
diﬀerent
divides
d
follows
from
the
fact
that
multiplication
by
d
on
an
elliptic
curve
induces
multiplication
by
d
on
the
diﬀerentials
of
the
elliptic
curve.
Remark.
Thus,
in
summary,
what
is
done
in
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX,
§3,
is
literally
correct
when
T
→
S
happens
to
be
a
disjoint
sum
of
copies
of
S
(a
condition
which
may
be
achieved
by
base-change).
In
general,
however,
there
is
a
certain
“twist”
that
must
be
taken
into
account,
but
which
was
overlooked
in
the
discussion
of
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX.
Section
2:
Lagrangian
Galois
Actions
In
this
§,
we
study
the
Galois
action
on
the
torsion
points
of
an
elliptic
curve,
along
with
the
resulting
“arithmetic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism”
(cf.
§1)
under
the
assumption
that
this
Galois
action
preserves
a
“rank
one
multiplicative
submodule
”
of
the
module
of
torsion
points.
In
this
situation,
we
show
that
the
resulting
“Lagrangian
Galois
action”
is
deﬁned
without
Gaussian
poles,
and,
moreover,
that
a
“certain
piece”
of
the
resulting
arithmetic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
coincides
with
the
classical
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
(cf.
§2.2).
This
further
strengthens
the
analogy
discussed
in
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX,
between
the
arithmetic
(or
“Galoistheoretic”)
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
and
the
classical
(“geometric”)
KodairaSpencer
morphism.
§2.1.
Deﬁnition
and
Construction
In
this
§,
we
maintain
the
notation
of
§1.
Moreover,
we
assume
that
we
are
given
a
ΠS
-submodule
M
μ
⊆
M
whose
underlying
Z/dZ-submodule
is
free
of
rank
one.
Thus,
we
obtain
an
exact
sequence
of
ΠS
-modules
0
→
M
μ
→
M
→
M
et
→
0
(where
M
et
is
deﬁned
so
as
to
make
this
sequence
exact).
Thus,
restricting
OZ
valued
functions
on
M
to
M
μ
gives
rise
to
a
surjection
def
F
=
Func(M,
OZ
)

F
μ
=
Func(M
μ
,
OZ
)
of
OZ
-algebras.
Observe
that
the
V-action
(cf.
Deﬁnition
1.1)
of
ΠS
on
F
manifestly
preserves
this
surjection,
so
we
get
a
natural
V-action
of
ΠS
on
F
μ
.
Since,
moreover,
we
are
operating
under
the
assumption
that
ΠS
preserves
the
submodule
M
μ
⊆
M
,
it
thus
follows
that
the
P-
and
D-actions
(cf.
Deﬁnition
1.)
of
ΠS
on
F
also
preserve
this
surjection,
so
we
also
get
natural
P-
and
D-actions
of
ΠS
on
GALOIS-THEORETIC
KODAIRA-SPENCER
9
F
μ
.
In
particular,
(cf.
Proposition
1.2)
taking
the
spectrum
(over
S)
of
the
ΠS
invariants
of
F
μ
with
respect
to
the
D-action
gives
rise
to
a
scheme
T
μ
together
with
a
morphism
Tμ
→
T
which
is
a
closed
immersion
over
US
[d−1
].
(Note
that
since
the
operation
of
taking
ΠS
-invariants
is
not
necessarily
right
exact,
it
is
not
clear
whether
or
not
T
μ
→
T
is
a
closed
immersion
over
S.)
Next,
let
us
suppose
that
we
are
given
a
splitting
MH
⊆
M
of
the
surjection
of
modules
M

M
et
(i.e.,
a
submodule
M
H
⊆
M
such
that
the
morphism
M
H
→
M
et
is
bijective),
which
is
not
necessarily
preserved
by
ΠS
.
Even
if
M
H
is
not
preserved
by
ΠS
,
however,
since
M
μ
⊆
M
is
preserved
by
ΠS
,
it
follows
that
an
element
σ
∈
ΠS
will
always
carry
M
H
⊆
M
to
another
splitting
σ
M
H
⊆
M
of
the
surjection
M

M
et
.
Next,
we
return
to
the
“de
Rham
point
of
view,”
and
consider
sections
of
line
bundles
on
the
universal
extension
of
E.
Also,
for
simplicity,
we
assume
from
now
on
that
S
is
Z-ﬂat,
and
that
d
is
odd.
Then
we
would
like
to
consider
the
Hodge-Arakelov
Comparison
Isomorphism
(cf.
[Mzk1],
Introduction,
Theorem
A),
so,
in
the
following
discussion,
we
will
use
the
notation
of
[Mzk1],
Introduction,
and
[Mzk3],
§9.
(Here,
we
recall
that
certain
minor
errors
in
[Mzk1],
Introduction,
Theorem
A
were
corrected
in
[Mzk3],
§9,
Theorem
9.2.)
Thus,
we
assume
that
we
have
been
given
an
integer
m
that
does
not
divide
d,
together
with
a
torsion
point
η
∈
E∞,S
(S∞
)
of
order
precisely
m
which
deﬁnes
a
metrized
line
bundle
Lst,η
on
E∞,S
(cf.
[Mzk1],
Chapter
V,
§1).
Here,
we
recall
that
S∞
is
the
stack
(in
the
ﬁnite,
ﬂat
topology)
obtained
from
S
by
gluing
together
US
(“away
from
inﬁnity”)
to
the
proﬁnite
covering
of
S
(“near
inﬁnity”)
deﬁned
by
“adjoining
a
compatible
system
of
N
-th
roots
of
the
q-parameter”
(as
N
ranges
multiplicatively
over
the
positive
integers).
Over
S∞
,
we
have
the
group
object
E∞,S
→
S∞
which
is
equal
to
E
→
S
over
US
(“away
from
inﬁnity”),
and
whose
“special
ﬁber”
consists
of
connected
components
indexed
by
Q/Z,
each
of
which
is
isomorphic
to
a
copy
of
Gm
—
cf.
the
discussion
of
[Mzk1],
Chapter
V,
§2,
for
more
details.
For
def
simplicity,
we
shall
also
assume
that
n
=
2m
is
invertible
on
S.
In
the
following
discussion,
we
shall
simply
write
L
for
Lst,η
.
Thus,
in
particular,
over
US
:
10
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
L|US
=
OE
(d
·
[η])|US
Also,
let
us
write
Ed,Z
→
Z
def
for
the
object
which
is
equal
to
EZ
=
E
×S
Z
over
UZ
,
and,
“near
inﬁnity,”
is
the
pull-back
to
Z
of
the
object
“Ed
”
(cf.
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IV,
§4,
where
we
take
“N
”
of
loc.
cit.
to
be
d).
(In
words,
this
object
“Ed
”
is
the
complement
of
the
nodes
of
the
unique
regular
semi-stable
model
of
the
Tate
curve
(with
q-parameter
“q”)
over
1
∗
→
E”
of
[Mzk3],
§9,
deﬁnes
an
object
the
base
Z[[q
d
]].)
Then
the
object
“E[d],et
∗
E[d],et,Z
→
Ed,Z
(which,
over
(UZ
)Q
,
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
universal
extension
E
†
→
E
of
E)
over
Ed,Z
.
Indeed,
the
discussion
of
[Mzk3],
§9,
applies
literally
over
UZ
;
“near
inﬁnity,”
the
fact
that
we
get
an
object
over
Ed,Z
follows
from
the
fact
that
the
integral
structure
in
question,
i.e.,
“
d·(T
−(irχ
/2m))
”
(in
the
notation
of
[Mzk3],
§9)
is
invariant
with
respect
to
the
transformations
T
→
T
+
dj
,
∀j
∈
Z.
Note
that
L
has
an
associated
theta
group
(cf.
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IV,
§1,
§5,
for
a
discussion
of
theta
groups)
GZ
over
Z
which
ﬁts
into
an
exact
sequence:
1
→
(Gm
)Z
→
GZ
→
d
EZ
→
1
(where
d
EZ
(⊆
Ed,Z
)
→
Z
is
the
ﬁnite
ﬂat
group
scheme
of
d-torsion
points).
Let
us
suppose
that
the
submodules
M
μ
,
M
H
⊆
M
arise
from
the
restriction
to
UZ
[d−1
]
of
ﬁnite
ﬂat
group
schemes
GμZ
,
HZ
⊆
d
EZ
over
Z
such
that
the
resulting
morphism
GμZ
×Z
HZ
→
d
EZ
is
an
isomorphism
of
group
schemes.
Thus,
(cf.
Proposition
1.2)
we
have
a
natural
inclusion
OGμZ
→
F
μ
of
ﬁnite
OZ
-algebras,
which
is
an
isomorphism
over
UZ
[d−1
].
In
the
following
discussion,
we
also
assume
that
GμZ
has
been
chosen
so
that
the
subalgebra
OGμZ
→
F
μ
is
preserved
by
the
various
actions
(i.e.,
V-,
P-,
D-)
of
ΠS
on
F
μ
.
Finally,
let
us
assume
that
we
are
given
a
lifting
HZ
⊆
GZ
GALOIS-THEORETIC
KODAIRA-SPENCER
11
∼
of
HZ
(i.e.,
HZ
→HZ
via
GZ
→
d
EZ
).
(Thus,
HZ
is
a
“Lagrangian
subgroup”
(cf.
[MB],
Chapitre
V,
Déﬁnition
2.5.1)
of
the
theta
group
GZ
.)
In
particular,
we
get
a
natural
action
of
HZ
∼
=
HZ
on
L.
In
the
following
discussion,
we
will
always
denote
(by
abuse
of
notation)
structure
morphisms
to
S,
Z,
E∞,S
by
f
(cf.
the
conventions
of
[Mzk1]).
We
would
like
to
consider
the
push-forward
def
∗
VL
=
f∗
(LE[d],et,Z
)
∗
∗
of
the
pull-back
LE[d],et,Z
of
the
metrized
line
bundle
L
to
E[d],et,Z
.
(Here,
we
take
the
integral
structure
of
this
push-forward
“near
inﬁnity”
to
be
the
unique
GZ
-stable
integral
structure
determined
by
the
“ζrCG
”
—
cf.
[Mzk1],
Chapter
V,
Theorem
4.8;
the
discussion
of
[Mzk3],
§4.1,
4.2.)
Thus,
VL
is
a
quasi-coherent
sheaf
on
Z.
Also,
often
we
would
like
to
consider
the
ﬁltration
F
r
(VL
)
⊆
VL
consisting
of
sections
whose
“torsorial
degree”
is
<
r.
(Here,
by
“torsorial
degree,”
we
mean
the
relative
degree
with
respect
to
the
structure
of
“relative
polynomial
algebra”
on
OE
†
over
OE
(arising
from
the
fact
that
E
†
→
E
is
an
aﬃne
torsor).
Since
E
†
∗
may
be
identiﬁed
with
E[d],et,Z
over
(UZ
)Q
,
this
deﬁnition
also
applies
to
sections
of
VL
.)
In
particular,
we
shall
write
def
HDR
=
F
d
(VL
)
for
the
object
which
appears
in
[Mzk1],
Introduction,
Theorem
A
(cf.
also
[Mzk3],
Theorem
9.2).
Thus,
HDR
is
a
vector
bundle
of
rank
d
on
Z.
Finally,
observe
that
the
theta
group
GZ
acts
naturally
on
VL
,
F
r
(VL
),
HDR
.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
(by
the
assumption
that
n
=
2m
is
invertible
on
S)
the
d-torsion
subgroup
scheme
d
EZ
⊆
Ed,Z
lifts
(uniquely!)
to
a
subgroup
scheme:
dE
∗
∗
⊆
E[d],et,Z
∗
(Indeed,
this
follows
from
the
fact
that
the
integral
structure
used
to
deﬁne
E[d],et,Z
is
given
by
“
d·(T
−(irχ
/2m))
”
(in
the
notation
of
[Mzk3],
§9),
an
expression
which
gives
integral
values
∈
OS
for
all
T
=
dj
(for
j
∈
Z).)
Moreover,
we
recall
from
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX,
§3,
that
(since
d
is
odd)
we
have
a
“theta
trivialization”
L|d
EZ
∼
=
L|0EZ
⊗OZ
Od
EZ
def
(where
0EZ
∈
EZ
(Z)
is
the
zero
section
of
EZ
=
E
×S
Z
→
Z)
of
the
restriction
of
L
to
d
EZ
⊆
Ed,Z
.
Note,
moreover,
since
L
is
deﬁned
over
E∞,S
(i.e.,
without
basechanging
to
Z),
it
follows
that
L|0EZ
is,
in
fact,
deﬁned
over
S∞
(i.e.,
in
other
words,
it
is
deﬁned
over
S,
except
that
“near
inﬁnity,”
one
may
need
to
adjoin
roots
of
the
q-parameter).
In
particular,
it
follows
that
there
is
a
natural
action
of
Gal(Z/S)
—
hence
of
ΠS
(via
the
surjection
ΠS

Gal(Z/S))
—
on
L0EZ
.

Thus,
by

,
and
composing
with

above,

if

that

that
it

from
the

§2.2.
Relation
to
the
Crystalline
Theta
Object
In
this
§,
we
continue
to
use
the
notations
of
§2.1,
except
that
we
further
specialize
them
as
follows.
Let
A
be
a
complete
discrete
valuation
ring
of
mixed
characteristic
(0,
p),
with
perfect
residue
ﬁeld.
Write
K
(respectively,
k)
for
the
quotient
ﬁeld
(respectively,
residue
ﬁeld)
of
A.
In
this
§,
we
suppose
that
S
is
of
the
form:
1
S
=
Spec(A[[q
N
]])
for
some
positive
integer
N
prime
to
d,
and
that
the
log
structure
on
S
is
that
1
deﬁned
by
the
divisor
V
(q
N
)
⊆
S.
Also,
we
suppose
that
the
given
log
elliptic
curve
C
log
→
S
log
is
the
“Tate
curve,”
i.e.,
that
it
has
“q-parameter”
equal
to
q
∈
OS
.
Thus,
if
we
take
A
suﬃciently
large,
we
may
assume
that
Z
is
of
the
form:
1
Z
=
Spec(A[[q
N
·d
]])
1
and
that
the
log
structure
on
Z
is
that
deﬁned
by
the
divisor
V
(q
N
·d
)
⊆
Z.
Thus,
we
obtain
a
morphism
Z
log
→
S
log
of
log
schemes.
def
Write
EZ
=
E
×S
Z.
Thus,
EZ
→
Z
is
a
one-dimensional
semi-abelian
scheme
over
Z.
Note
that
EZ
has
a
unique
ﬁnite
ﬂat
subgroup
scheme
annihilated
by
d.
This
subgroup
scheme
is
naturally
isomorphic
to
μd
.
We
take
this
subgroup
scheme
for
our
μ
μd
∼
=
GZ
⊆
d
EZ
⊆
EZ
(and
note
that
it
is
easy
to
see
that
this
GμZ
satisﬁes
the
condition
(cf.
§2.1)
that
OGμZ
⊆
F
μ
be
preserved
by
the
V-,
P-,
and
D-actions
of
ΠS
on
F
μ
).
Moreover,
since
(d
EZ
)/GμZ
is
naturally
isomorphic
to
the
constant
group
scheme
(Z/dZ)Z
,
it
is
easy
to
see
that,
over
Z,
there
exists
a
ﬁnite
étale
group
scheme
HZ
⊆
d
EZ
such
that
the
natural
morphism
GμZ
×Z
HZ
→
d
EZ
def
is
an
isomorphism
of
group
schemes.
Thus,
if
we
write
EHZ
=
(Ed,Z
)H
,
then
we
see
that
EHZ
→
Z
is
a
one-dimensional
semi-abelian
group
scheme
(i.e.,
its
ﬁbers
are
all
geometrically
connected),
and
that
the
natural
quotient
morphism
GALOIS-THEORETIC


EHZ
(over
Z)
has

equal
to
HZ
,
hence

ﬁnite
étale
of

d.
Finally,
we
note
that
the
q-parameter
of
EHZ
is
a
d-th
root
of
q.
This
completes
our
description
of
the
specializations
of
the
objects
of
§2.1
that
we
will
use
in
the
present
§.
Next,
we
would
like
to
relate
the
present
discussion
to
the
theory
of
connections
in
[Mzk3].
To
begin
with,
we
recall
that
L|0EZ
(where
0EZ
∈
EZ
(Z)
is
the
zero
section
of
EZ
→
Z)
is
a
line
bundle
on
Z
equipped
with
a
natural
ΠS
-action;
moreover,
this
ΠS
-action
is
derived
from
the
fact
that
L|0EZ
in
fact
arises
from
a
“line
bundle
on
S∞
.”
Thus,
there
exists
a
trivialization
τ
:
L|0EZ
∼
=
q
−
N
·d
·
OZ
a
(where
a
is
a
nonnegative
integer
<
N
d)
—
i.e.,
in
the
terminology
of
the
discussion
of
[Mzk3],
§5,
a
rigidiﬁcation
of
L
at
0EZ
—
which
is
ΠS
-equivariant.
In
the
following
discussion,
we
ﬁx
such
a
“ΠS
-equivariant
rigidiﬁcation”
τ
.
Observe
that
τ
deﬁnes,
in
particular,
a
logarithmic
connection
on
the
line
bundle
L|0EZ
which
is
stable
under
the
action
of
ΠS
.
Thus,
according
to
the
theory
of
[Mzk3],
§5,
this
rigidiﬁcation
gives
rise
to
(logarithmic)
connections
∇VL
,
∇V
HZ
L
on
VL
,
VLHZ
,
respectively
(cf.
[Mzk3],
Theorems
5.2,
8.1),
which
are
stabilized
by
the
action
of
ΠS
.
Here,
the
logarithmic
connections
are
relative
to
the
log
structure
of
Z
log
,
and
all
connections,
diﬀerentials,
etc.,
are
to
be
understood
as
being
continuous
with
respect
to
the
(p,
q)-adic
topology
on
OZ
.
Moreover,
since
all
higher
p-curvatures
of
these
connections
vanish
(cf.
[Mzk3],
§7.1,
for
a
discussion
of
the
general
theory
of
higher
p-curvatures;
[Mzk3],
Corollary
7.6,
for
the
vanishing
result
just
quoted),
we
thus
conclude
that
VL
,
VLHZ
deﬁne
“crystals”
on
the
site
Inf(Z
log
⊗
k/A)
of
inﬁnitesimal
thickenings
over
A
of
open
sub-log
schemes
of
Z
log
⊗
k
=
Z
log
⊗
(A/mA
).
That
is
to
say,
usually,
“crystals”
are
deﬁned
on
sites
of
PD-thickenings
(cf.,
e.g.,
[BO],
§6,
for
a
discussion
of
this
theory),
but
here,
since
all
of
the
higher
p-curvatures
vanish,
we
obtain
crystals
on
the
site
of
thickenings
which
do
not
necessarily
admit
PD-structures.
Since
the
deﬁnitions
and
proofs
of
basic
properties
of
such
“crystals
on
Inf”
are
entirely
similar
to
the
divided
power
case,
we
leave
the
unenlightening
details
to
the
reader.
Thus,
in
summary,
we
may
think
of
the
pairs
(VL
,
∇VL
);
(VLHZ
,
∇V
HZ
)
L
16
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
as
crystals
on
Inf(Z
log
⊗
k/A).
In
the
following
discussion,
we
will
not
use
the
entire
group
ΠS
,
but
only
its
“m-inertia
subgroup”
Πm
S
⊆
ΠS
,
deﬁned
as
follows:
(ΠS
⊇)
Πm
S
=
{σ
∈
ΠS
|
σ(φ)
≡
φ
def
(mod
mA
·
OZ
),
∀φ
∈
OZ
}
Thus,
in
particular,
one
veriﬁes
easily
that
the
image
Galm
(Z/S)
of
Πm
S
in
Gal(Z/S)
is
a
p-group.
More
precisely,
if
we
write
d
=
dp
·
d=p
(where
dp
,
d=p
are
positive
integers;
dp
is
a
power
of
p;
and
d=p
is
prime
to
p),
then
one
veriﬁes
immediately
(using
the
simple
explicit
structures
of
S,
Z)
that
the
correspondence
1
1
σ
→
σ(q
N
·d
)/q
N

ΠS
deﬁnes
isomorphisms:

ΠS

Gal(Z/S)

Z)(1)
⏐
⏐
(Z/dZ)(1)
(where
the
vertical
arrows
are
the
natural
inclusions,
and
the
horizontal
arrows
are
deﬁned
by
the
correspondence
just
mentioned).
Next,
let
us
observe
that
it
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
Πm
S
that
m
every
σ
∈
ΠS
deﬁnes
an
A-linear
isomorphism
∼
σ
:
Z
log
→
Z
log
which
is
the
identity
on
Z
log
⊗
k.
It
thus
follows
from:
(i)
the
fact
that
Z
log
deﬁnes
a(n)
(inductive
system
of)
thickening(s)
in
the
category
Inf(Z
log
⊗
k/A);
and
(iii)
the
fact
that
(VLHZ
,
∇V

)
forms
a
crystal
on
Inf(Z
log
⊗
k/A)
L
that
σ

Here,
the
justiﬁcation
for

is
that
this

the

of

we

this
image
is
shown
to
be
the
same
as
that
of
the
theta
convolution;
but
the
argument
never
uses
that
the
derivatives
are
of
order
<
d
—
i.e.,
the
exact
same
argument
shows
that
the
image
Z
(=
the
span
of
the
derivatives
of
the
theta
function
“Θ”
of
arbitrary
order)
of
ΞH
V
is
equal
to
the
image
of
the
theta
convolution.
For
the
convenience
of
the
reader,
however,
we
review
the
argument
brieﬂy
as
Z
follows:
If
we
write
“U
”
for
the
standard
coordinate
on
Gm
,
then
the
image
of
ΞH
H
(respectively,
ΞHZ
)
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
span
of
the
restrictions
to
μd
⊆
Gm
V
∂
j
of
the
derivatives
(
∂U
)
Θ

χ(k)

(and
χ
(a

),
iχ
(an
integer)
are
invariants
associated
to
the
torsion
point
η)
—
of
order
<
d
(respectively,
arbitrary
order).
On
the
other
hand,
a
basis
of
the
functions
on
μd
is
given
by
U
0
,
.
.
.
,
U
d−1
.
If
one
computes
the
coordinates
(relative
to
this
basis)
of
Θ|μd
,
one
sees
that
the
coeﬃcient
of
the
smallest
power
of
q
appearing
in
each
coordinate
is
either
a
root
of
unity
or
a
root
of
unity
times
a
nonzero
sum
of
two
n-th
roots
of
unity
(cf.
[Mzk2],
Theorem
4.4,
where
we
take
dord
to
be
1).
Since
we
have
assumed
that
n
is
invertible
on
S
(cf.
Theorem
2.1),
we
thus
obtain
that
this
coeﬃcient
is
always
a
unit.
On
the
other
hand,
to
give
an
element
in
the
span
in
question
is
to
consider
the
restriction
to
μd
⊆
Gm
of
a
series

P

is
a

(with
coeﬃcients
in

⊗
Q,
but
which
maps
Z
into
Z
OZ
)
of
degree
<
d
(respectively,
arbitrary
degree)
in
the
case
of
ΞH
H
(respectively,
ΞHZ
).
Thus,
in
short,
the
assertion
of
Lemma
2.6
amounts
to
the
claim
that
the
V
span
of
{P
(k)
·
q
Φ(k)
·
U
k
}k=0,...
,d−1
(for
some
function
Φ
:
{0,

d

·
Z)
is
the
same,
regardless
of
whether
one
restricts
the
degree
of
P
((−)
to
be
<
d
or
not.
But
this
is
easily
veriﬁed.
Finally,
we
observe
that:
Theorem
2.4
allows
us
to
relate
the
“arithmetic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism”
arising
from
the
Lagrangian
Galois
action
to
the
classical
geometric
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism.

as
follows:
Let
Γ
⊆
Galm
(Z/S)
def
be
a
subgroup
of
order
>
2.
Write
dΓ
=
|Γ|
for
the
order
of
Γ.
Thus,
dΓ
=
1
divides
dp
,
and
we
have
a
natural
isomorphism
Γ
∼
=
(Z/dΓ
Z)(1)
(cf.
the
discussion
above
immediately
following
the
deﬁnition
of
Πm
S
).
Write
(p
·
A
⊆)
mΓ

A
for
the
ideal
generated
by
elements
of
the
form
1
−
ζ,
where
ζ
is
a
dΓ
-th
root
of
unity.
Note
that
Γ
acts
trivially
on
Z
⊗
(A/mΓ
)
(mod
mΓ
).
Moreover,
we
have
a
homomorphism
λΓ
:
μdΓ
(A)
→
mΓ
/m2Γ
given
by
ζ
→
ζ
−
1
(mod
m2Γ
).
Thus,
if
we
think
of
μdΓ
(A)
as
“(Z/dΓ
Z)(1)”
(which
is
naturally
isomorphic
to
Γ),
then
we
see
that
λΓ
deﬁnes
a
homomorphism
δΓ
:
Γ
→
mΓ
/m2Γ
which
is
easily
seen
(by
the
deﬁnition
of
the
ideal
mΓ
)
to
induce
an
injection
Γ
⊗
(Z/pZ)
→
mΓ
/m2Γ
.
Next,
we
would
like
to
consider
a
“certain
portion”
of
the
“arithmetic
KodairaSpencer
morphism”
associated
to
the
Lagrangian
Galois
action,
which
will
turn
out
to
be
related
to
the
classical
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism.
Let
γ
∈
Γ.
Then
since
γ
HZ
via
the
Lagrangian
Galois
D-action
(Deﬁnition
2.3,
Corollary
2.5),
we
acts
on

HZ
HZ
see
that

and

with

F

thus
obtain

Thus,
we
obtain

which
we
would
like
to
analyze
by
applying
Theorem
2.4.
If
one
reduces
the
commutative
diagram
of
Theorem
2.4
modulo
m2Γ
,
it
follows
that
κγ
may
be
computed
by
applying
the

That
is
to

Applying

and
then
projecting
via


VLHZ

deﬁnes
a
morphism:
F

(VLHZ
)
⊗
k
→
VLHZ
/F

(VLHZ

⊗
mΓ

On
the
other
hand,
by
[Mzk3],
Theorem
8.1
(i.e.,
the
property
which
was
called
“Griﬃths
semi-transversality”
in
loc.
cit.),
this
morphism
in
fact
maps
into
the
submodule
F

(VLHZ
)/F

(VLHZ
)
⊗
mΓ
/m2Γ
.
Moreover,
(F

is
naturally
isomorphic
to

F

(VLHZ

⊗
τE⊗2
(where
we
write
τEHZ
for
the
tangent

).
In
particular,
we
obtain
that
κγ
also
maps
into
F

(−).
(Note
that
here
we
use
that
d

Thus,
by

we

with

Theorem

this

coincides
(up

with
the

associated
to
the
Gauss-Manin

Thus,
in
summary,
the
arithmetic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
associated
to
the
Lagrangian

coincides
modulo
m2Γ
(and
up
to
a

with
the
usual
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism.
Remark.
Note,
moreover,
that
the
correspondence
between
the
logarithmic
tangent
∂
∈
(ΩZ

and
the
morphism
δΓ
is
essentially
the
same
as
the

correspondence
arising
from
Faltings’
theory
of
almost
étale
extensions
between
the
logarithmic
tangent
bundle
of
Z
log
and
a
certain
Galois
cohomology
group
(cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX,
§2,
especially
Theorem
2.6,
for
more
details).
In
particular:
Corollary
2.7
shows
that
the
analogy
discussed
in
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX,
between
the
(usual)
geometric
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
(cf.
especially,
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX,
Theorem
2.6)
and
the
arithmetic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
is
more
than
just
philosophy
—
it
is
rigorous
mathematics!
(cf.
also
the
discussion
of
[Mzk3],
Theorem
6.2,

Section

Global

In
this

we
show
how
to
construct
a
sort
of
global
analogue
of
the
crucial
subgroup
scheme
“GμZ

”
of
§2.2.
The

believes
that
this
construction
indicates
the
proper
approach
to
globalizing
the
local

of

—

In
this
§,
let
us
write
MZ
for
the
moduli
stack
(M1,0
)Z
(cf.
§0,
Notations
and
Conventions);
MZ
⊆
MZ
for
the
open
substack
parametrizing
smooth
elliptic
curves.
We
denote
base
change
to
Q
by
a
subscript
Q.
Also,
let
us
write
def
ΠMQ
=
π1
(MQ
)
(for
some
choice
of
base-point).
Next,
let
us
ﬁx
a
prime
number
p.
Thus,
the
p-power
torsion
points
of
the
tautological
elliptic
curve
over
MQ
deﬁne
a
p-adic
Tate
module
F
—
i.e.,
F
is
a
free
Zp
-module
of
rank
two
equipped
with
a
continuous
ΠMQ
-action
ρF
:
ΠMQ

Write
TQ
→
MQ
for
the
proﬁnite
étale
covering
deﬁned
by
the
subgroup
Ker(ρF
)
⊆
ΠMQ
.
Since
ρF
is
surjective
(cf.,
e.g.,
[Shi],
Theorem
6.23,
together
with
the
fact
that
the
cyclotomic
character
Gal(Q/Q)
→
Zp
×
is
surjective),
it
follows
that
TQ
→
MQ
is
Galois,
with
Galois
group
Gal(TQ
/MQ
)
∼
=
GL2
(Zp
)
(where
the
isomorphism
is
determined
by
a
choice
of
Zp
-basis
for
F).
Write
T
Z

for
the

Also,
in
the
following
discussion,
we
will
denote
the
p-adic
formal
schemes
(or
stacks)
deﬁned
by
p-adically
completing
various
schemes
(or
stacks)
by
means
of
a
superscript
“∧.”
Now
note
that
the
natural
ΠMQ
-actions
on
T
Z
and
F
deﬁne
a
natural
ΠMQ
action
on
O
TZ
⊗Zp
F
(which
we
regard
as
a
coherent
sheaf
on
T
Z
).
Let
us
write
ωE
for
the
line
bundle
on
MZ
deﬁned
by
the
cotangent
bundle
at
the
origin
of
the
tautological
log
elliptic
curve
over
MZ
.
Then
we
recall
the
following
result,
which
is
essentially
an
immediate
corollary
of
the
p-adic
Hodge
theory
of
elliptic
curves:

Theorem
3.1.
(Global
Multiplicative
Subspace)
There
is
a
natural
ΠMQ
equivariant
morphism
ψω
:
O
⊗Zp
F
→
ωE
|
TZ
whose
image
contains
(1
−
ζp
)
·
ωE
|
TZ
TZ
,
where
ζp
is
a
primitive
p-th
root
of
unity.
Moreover,
away
from
the
supersingular
points
of
T
Z
⊗Fp
,
this
morphism
is
a
surjection,
and
(in
a
formal
neighborhood
of
inﬁnity)
its
kernel
is
the
subspace
deﬁned
by
def
the
multiplicative
subgroup
schemes
“GμZ
⊆
d
EZ
”
(cf.
§2.2)
where
we
take
d
=
pn
,
n
→
∞.
Proof.
The
morphism
ψω
is
what
is
usually
referred
to
in
p-adic
Hodge
theory
as
the
p-adic
period
map.
There
are
many
ways
to
construct
the
p-adic
period
map.
Over
the
smooth
locus
MZ
,
one
way
to
construct
the
period
map
(cf.
[Mzk3],
§2,
the
Remark
following
the
proof
of
Theorem
2.2)
is
to
use
the
canonical
section
(deﬁned
modulo
pn
—
cf.
[Mzk3],
§1,
the
discussion
following
Lemma
1.1
for
more
details
on
this
canonical
section)
κH
:
H
⊗
(Z/pn
Z)
→
E
†
⊗
(Z/pn
Z)
of
the
universal
extension
E
†
→
E
(where
E
→
MZ
is
the
tautological
elliptic
def
curve)
over
the
covering
H
(
=
E)
→
E
of
E
given
by
multiplication
by
pn
(where
we
let
n
→
∞).
By
looking
at
“ﬁbers
(of
H,
E
†
)
over
the
origin
of
E,”
we
thus
see
that
κH
determines
a
homomorphism
from
the
pn
-torsion
points
of
E|TZ
,
i.e.,
in
particular,
from
F
⊗
(Z/pn
Z)
→
E(TZ
),
to
ωE
⊗
(Z/pn
Z)|TZ
,
as
desired.
Note
that
although
only
the
smooth
case
is
discussed
in
loc.
cit.,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
this
approach
may
be
extended
over
MZ
(by
using
the
canonical
section
of
the
universal
extension
near
inﬁnity).
Letting
n
→
∞
and
tensoring
over
Zp
with
O
thus
completes
the
construction
of
ψω
.
TZ
The
remaining
statements
concerning
the
various
properties
of
ψω
may
be
veriﬁed
by
using
another
approach
to
constructing
the
p-adic
period
map,
which
is
discussed
in
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX,
§2.
This
approach
has
the
slight
disadvantage
that
it
is
not
immediately
clear
that
the
resulting
period
map
is
deﬁned
over
T
(i.e.,
Z

a
priori,
it
is
only
deﬁned
over
locally
constructed
“R’s”).
Nevertheless,
one
may
check
easily
(by
working
over
the
ordinary
locus)
that
these
two
approaches
yield
the
same
period
map
(cf.
[Mzk3],
§2,
the
Remark
following
the
proof
of
Theorem
2.2).
On
the
other
hand,
the
approach
of
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX,
§2,
has
the
advantage
that
it
makes
it
clear
that
the
morphism
ψω
:
O
⊗Zp
F
→
ωE
|
in
question
is
TZ
TZ

the
composite
(at
least
locally
on
T
,
but
this
is
suﬃcient
for
our
purposes)
of
a
Z
morphism
—
which
we
shall
denote
ψ1
—
from
O
⊗Zp
F
to
a
certain
rank
two
TZ

vector
bundle
on
T
,
followed
by
a
surjection
—
which
we
shall
denote
ψ
—
from
Z
2
this
vector
bundle
onto
the
line
bundle
ωE
|
(cf.
the
morphism
“ΨZp
”
—
or,
TZ
more
precisely,
its
dual
—
of
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX,
Theorem
2.5).
Moreover,
the
determinant
of
ψ1
is
equal
to
1
−
ζp
times
a
unit
(cf.
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX,
Theorem
24
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
2.5,
as
well
as
the
proof
of
this
theorem).
On
the
other
hand,
since
the
range
of
the
morphism
ψω
is
a
line
bundle,
it
follows
that
the
image
of
ψω
determines
an
ideal
J
⊆
O
with
the
property
that
det(ψ1
)
vanishes
modulo
J
.
Thus,
we
TZ
conclude
that
1
−
ζp
∈
J
,
as
desired.
Finally,
the
assertions
of
Theorem
3.1
over
the
ordinary
locus
and
near
inﬁnity
follow
from
the
theory
of
either
[Mzk3],
§2,
or
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IX,
§2.
This
completes
the
proof
Remark.
Usually,
in
the
context
of
p-adic
Hodge
theory,
one
constructs
the
p-adic
period
map
not
over
global
bases
such
as
MZ
,
but
over
p-adic
bases,
such
as
MZp
.
It
is
immediate,
however,
from
the
ﬁrst
approach
discussed
in
the
proof
of
Theorem
3.1
to
constructing
the
p-adic
period
map
that
exactly
the
same
construction
works
over
MZ
and
gives
rise
to
a
morphism
that
is
equivariant
with
respect
to
ΠMQ
=
π1
(MQ
)
(i.e.,
not
just
π1
(MQp
)).
(The
author
wishes
to
thank
A.
Tamagawa
for
remarks
that
led
to
a
simpliﬁcation
of
the
proof
of
Theorem
3.1.)
Remark.
Thus,
in
particular,
we
obtain
that
if
E
is
a
log
elliptic
curve
over
Z,
then
(by
pull-back
via
the
classifying
morphism
to
M1,0
deﬁned
by
E)
the
morphism
ψω
deﬁnes
a
Gal(Q/Q)-equivariant
morphism:
ψω
(E)
:
Tp
(E)
⊗Zp
O
→
ωE
⊗OF
O
Q
Q
(where
Tp
(E)
is
the
p-adic
Tate
module
of
E;
Q
is
an
algebraic
closure
of
Q;
and
the
“hat”
denotes
p-adic
completion)
whose
image
contains
p
·
ωE
(cf.
Theorems
3.1,
3.2).
In
particular,
since
the
completions
of
Q
at
each
of
its
primes
over
p
are
all
valuation
rings,
we
thus
conclude
that
ψω
(E)
deﬁnes
a
Gal(Q/Q)-equivariant
surjection

ψω
(E)
:
Tp
(E)
⊗Zp
O
→
ωE
Q

(where
ωE
⊆
ωE
⊗Z
O
is
a
free
O
-submodule
of
rank
one)
which
coincides
with
Q
Q
ψω
(E)
over
Qp
.
Thus,
the
kernel
of
ψω
(E)
may
be
regarded
as
a
global
generalization
of
the
multiplicative
subspace
“Zp
(1)
⊆
Tp
(E)”
of
the
Tate
curve
E
over
Z[[q]].
Section
4:
The
Group
Tensor
Product
In
this
§,
we
present
a
very
general
construction
that
applies
to
arbitrary
commutative
group
schemes,
but
which
will
be
of
fundamental
importance
for
motivating
the
theory
that
we
wish
to
pursue
in
subsequent
papers.
We
begin
with
the
following
deﬁnition,
which
is
motivated
by
inﬁnite
abelian
group
theory
(cf.
[Fchs],
p.
94):
GALOIS-THEORETIC
KODAIRA-SPENCER
25
Deﬁnition
4.1.
We
shall
call
a
torsion-free
abelian
group
R
ind-free
if
every
ﬁnite
subset
of
R
is
contained
in
a
ﬁnitely
generated
direct
summand
of
R.
Remark.
It
is
known
that
every
countable
subgroup
of
an
ind-free
group
is
free
(cf.
[Fchs],
pp.
93-94).
Thus,
in
particular,
every
countable
ind-free
group
is
free.
On
the
other
hand,
groups
such
as
an
inﬁnite
direct
product
of
inﬁnite
cyclic
groups
are
ind-free,
but
not
free
(cf.
[Fchs],
p.
94).
The
reason
that
we
wish
to
consider
ind-free
groups
is
because
we
wish
to
allow
just
such
groups
—
i.e.,
such
as
the
additive
group
of
power
series
Z[[q]]
—
in
the
theory
to
be
developed
in
the
present
and
subsequent
papers.
Now
let
S
be
a
noetherian
scheme,
and
G
a
commutative
group
scheme
over
S.
(Note:
we
do
not
necessarily
assume
that
G
is
smooth
or
of
locally
of
ﬁnite
type
over
S.)
Thus,
G
deﬁnes
a
functor
T
→
G(T
)
from
the
category
of
S-schemes
(such
as
T
→
S)
to
the
category
of
abelian
groups.
Next,
let
us
assume
that
we
are
given
an
ind-free
Z-module
R
(cf.
Deﬁnition
4.1).
Then
let
us
consider
the
functor
T
→
G(T
)
⊗Z
R
gp
—
which
we
denote
by
G
⊗
R
—
from
the
category
of
S-schemes
(such
as
T
→
S)
to
the
category
of
abelian
groups.
Deﬁnition
4.2.
We
shall
refer
to
as
an
ind-group
scheme
an
inductive
system
(indexed
by
a
ﬁltered
set)
of
group
schemes
in
which
the
transition
morphisms
are
all
closed
immersions.
Remark.
Thus,
a
Barsotti-Tate
group
(e.g.,
the
p-divisible
group
deﬁned
by
an
abelian
variety)
is
a
typical
example
of
an
ind-group
scheme.
Note
that
it
is
important
to
assume
that
the
transition
morphisms
are
closed
immersions.
Indeed,
so
long
as
one
assumes
this,
taking
the
inverse
limit
of
sheaves
of
functions
on
the
group
schemes
in
the
system
gives
rise
to
a
sheaf
of
“functions
on
the
ind-group
scheme”
which
surjects
onto
the
sheaves
of
functions
on
each
of
the
group
schemes
in
the
system.
If,
on
the
other
hand,
one
considers
an
inductive
system
such
as
E
→
E
→
E
→
E
→
E
→
...
(where
E
is
an
elliptic
curve,
and
all
of
the
arrows
are
multiplication
by
some
positive
integer
d),
then
the
inverse
limit
of
the
functions
on
the
group
schemes
in
26
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
the
system
contains
only
the
constant
functions.
Thus,
it
is
diﬃcult
to
treat
this
sort
of
inductive
system
as
a
single
geometric
object.
gp
Proposition
4.3.
This
functor
G
⊗
R
is
representable
by
an
ind-group
scheme
gp
over
S,
which,
by
abuse
of
notation,
we
also
denote
by
G
⊗
R.
Moreover:
gp
(1)
G
⊗
R
is
functorial
with
respect
to
G
and
R.
gp
(2)
If
R
is
ﬁnitely
generated,
then
G
⊗
R
is
representable
by
a
(single)
group
scheme.
(3)
If
R
and
R
are
ﬁnitely
generated
free
Z-modules,
and
R
→
R
gp
gp
is
a
split
injection,
then
the
resulting
arrow
G
⊗
R
→
G
⊗
R
is
a
closed
immersion.
Proof.
First,
note
that
any
ind-free
R
can
be
written
as
an
inductive
limit
lim
Rj
−→
of
ﬁnitely
generated
free
Z-submodules
Rj
(for
j
in
some
ﬁltered
index
set
J)
such
that
the
injections
Rj
→
R
are
split.
Moreover,
when
j
<
j

(so
Rj
⊆
Rj

),
the
fact
that
Rj
→
R
is
split
implies
that
Rj
⊆
Rj

is
split.
Thus,
the
representability
gp
of
G
⊗
R
(for
a
general
ind-free
R)
by
an
ind-group
scheme
over
S
follows
formally
from
assertions
(1),
(2),
(3).
Let
us
prove
(2),
(3).
Thus,
for
the
remainder
of
this
paragraph,
let
us
assume
that
R
is
ﬁnitely
generated
(and
free).
But
then
R
is
(noncanonically)
isomorphic
gp
to
Zr
(for
some
positive
integer
r),
so
G
⊗
R
can
be
represented
by
the
group
scheme
G
×S
G
×S
.
.
.
×S
G
(the
ﬁbered
product
over
S
of
r
copies
of
G).
This

proves
(2).
Since
any
split
injection
Zr
→
Zr
is
isomorphic
to
the
injection
Zr
=


Zr
×
{0}
→
Zr
×
Zr
−r
=
Zr
,
assertion
(3)
follows
immediately.
Finally,
assertion
(1)
follows
immediately
from
the
functorial
deﬁnition
of
gp
G
⊗
R.
Deﬁnition
4.4.
By
abuse
of
notation,
we
denote
the
ind-group
scheme
of
Propogp
sition
4.3
by
G
⊗
R,
and
refer
to
this
ind-group
scheme
as
the
group
tensor
product
of
G
with
R.
Remark.
We
shall
principally
be
interested
in
the
case
where
G
is
an
elliptic
curve
∗
E,
or
its
universal
extension
equipped
with
some
integral
structure
—
e.g.,
E[d],et
—
and
R
is
a
ring
closely
related
to
the
base
scheme
over
which
E
is
deﬁned
—
e.g.,
R
=
OF
(the
ring
of
integers)
for
some
number
ﬁeld
F
.
GALOIS-THEORETIC
KODAIRA-SPENCER
27
Remark.
Note
that
automorphisms
of
the
module
R
induce
automomorphisms
of
gp
G
⊗
R.
Moreover,
if,
for
instance,
R
is
ﬁnitely
generated,
and
G
is
equipped
with
an
ample
line
bundle
L,
then
any
choice
of
basis
e1
,
.
.
.
,
er
of
R
determines
an
gp
r
isomorphism
G
⊗
R
∼
G,
hence
(by
taking
the
tensor
product
of
the
pull=
j=1
backs
of
L
relative
to
each
of
the
factors
in
the
product),
a
natural
choice
of
ample
gp
line
bundle
on
G
⊗
R.
This
ample
line
bundle,
however,
depends
on
the
choice
of
basis,
i.e.,
it
will
not
be
preserved
in
general
by
automorphisms
of
R.
Thus,
in
summary:
Although
(for,
say,
ﬁnitely
generated
R)
the
correspondence
G
→
gp
G
⊗
R
deﬁnes
a
natural
functor
from
group
schemes
to
group
schemes,
it
does
not
deﬁne
a
natural
functor
from
polarized
group
schemes
to
polarized
group
schemes.
Since,
in
Hodge-Arakelov
theory,
it
is
of
fundamental
importance
to
work
with
polarized
group
schemes,
the
rather
superﬁcial
general
nonsense
of
the
present
§
will
not
be
suﬃcient
for
working
with
group
tensored
elliptic
curves
in
Hodge-Arakelov
theory.
The
resolution
of
this
technical
issue
forms
one
of
the
main
obstacles
relative
to
developing
a
theory
of
the
sort
that
the
author
envisions
for
globalizing
the
theory
of
§2.
One
important
property
of
the
group
tensor
product
is
the
following:
Proposition
4.5.
gp
gp
Let
d
≥
1
be
an
integer,
and
write
d
G
⊆
G
(respectively,
d
(G
⊗
R)
⊆
G
⊗
R)
for
the
kernel
of
the
morphism
[d]
:
G
→
G
(respectively,
[d]
:
gp
gp
G
⊗
R
→
G
⊗
R),
i.e.,
multiplication
by
d.
Then
we
have
a
natural
isomorphism:
gp
∼
d
(G
⊗
R)
=
(d
G)
⊗Z/dZ
(R/d
·
R)
gp
Proof.
This
follows
immediately
from
the
functorial
deﬁnition
of
G
⊗
R.
Conclusion:
If
we
formally
combine
Proposition
4.5
with
the
content
of
the
second
Remark
following
Theorem
3.1,
we
thus
obtain
the
following:
If
E
is
a
log
elliptic
curve
over
Z;
d
=
pr
(where
p
is
a
prime
def
number,
and
r
≥
1
is
an
integer);
and
R
=
OK
is
the
ring
of
integers
of
some
ﬁnite
Galois
extension
K
of
Q
(which
may
28
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
depend
on
the
choice
of
d),
then
the
rank
2
(R/dR)-module
of
gp
d-torsion
points
of
E
⊗
R
contains
a
rank
1
submodule
stabilized
by
Gal(Q/Q)
and
which
coincides
with
the
usual
“multiplicative
subspace”
at
primes
of
bad
(multiplicative)
reduction.
In
particular,
this
conclusion
suggests
that
if
we
could
somehow
develop
a
“Hodgegp
Arakelov
theory
for
objects
such
as
E
⊗
R,”
then
we
should
be
able
to
deﬁne
for
such
objects
a
Lagrangian
Galois-theoretic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
which
is
free
of
Gaussian
poles
(cf.
Corollary
2.5).
In
subsequent
papers,
it
is
the
hope
of
the
author
to
develop
just
such
a
theory.
