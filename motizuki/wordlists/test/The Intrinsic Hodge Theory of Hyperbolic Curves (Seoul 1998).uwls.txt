Uniformizations
Deﬁned
by
the
Exponential
Function
In
elementary
mathematics,
the
simplest
variety
–
i.e.,
geometric
object
deﬁned
by
polynomial
equations
–
that
one
encounters
is
a
line,
i.e.,
the
set
of
points
in
the
Euclidean
plane
R2
deﬁned
by
an
equation
of
the
form
aX
+
bY
=
c
(where
a,
b,
c
∈
R).
After
translation,
rotation,
and
dilation,
such
an
equation
may
be
written
in
the
form
X
=
0.
In
this
case,
the
variety
in
question
passes
through
the
origin
and,
moreover,
admits
a
natural
group
structure.
Also,
it
is
easy
to
understand
in
a
very
explicit
way
the
totality
of
points
(x,
y)
∈
R2
that
lie
on
this
variety:
Indeed,
this
set
may
be
identiﬁed
(via
the
projection
(x,
y)
→
y)
with
R
itself.
The
next
simplest
type
of
variety
that
one
encounters
is
the
variety
in
R2
deﬁned
by
an
equation
of
degree
2.
After
translation,
rotation,
reﬂection,
and
dilation
of
the
X
and
Y
coordinates,
we
see
that
such
an
equation
is
always
one
of
the
following
three
types:
X
2
+
Y
2
=
1,
XY
=
1,
X
2
=
Y
.
In
the
ﬁnal
case,
X
2
=
Y
,
the
projection
(x,
y)
→
x
deﬁnes
a
natural
bijection
of
the
set
of
points
on
the
variety
with
R.
In
the
ﬁrst
two
cases,
however,
such
projections
do
not
give
isomorphisms
of
the
given
variety
with
a
linear
variety.
In
the
ﬁrst
two
cases,
in
order
to
ﬁnd
an
explicit
cataloguing
indexed
by
R
of
all
the
points
(x,
y)
lying
on
the
variety
–
such
a
linear
cataloguing
is
called
a
uniformization
–
it
is
necessary
to
introduce
functions
that
are
not
algebraic,
i.e.,
polynomial
in
nature.
Namely,
the
maps
i
·
t
→
ei·t
∈
C
=
{x
+
iy
|
x,
y
∈
R}
=
{(x,
y)
|
x,
y
∈
R}
=
R2
and
t
→
(et
,
e−t
)
∈
R2
where
t
∈
R,
and
et
is
the
exponential
function

deﬁne
such
catalogues,
or
uniformizations,
for
the
varieties
X
2
+
Y
2
=
1
and
XY
=
1,
respectively.
Moreover,
these
uniformizations
are
homomorphisms
with
respect
to
the
additive
group
structure
on
R
and
certain
natural
group
structures
on
the
target
varieties
which
are
deﬁned
by
polynomial
equations.
In
the
case
of
XY
=
1,
this
uniformization
map
is
a
bijection,
while
in
the
case
of
X
2
+
Y
2
=
1,
the
uniformization
map
is
surjective,
but
has
a
kernel
generated
by
2πi
∈
R
·
i.
Since
the
uniformization
map
is
normalized
in
both
cases
by
the
condition
that
the
derivative
at
0
∈
R
have
length
1,
it
thus
follows
that
the
number
2πi
∈
R
·
i
is
naturally
associated
to
the
unit
circle
(i.e.,
the
variety
deﬁned
by
X
2
+
Y
2
=
1).
Such
a
number
is
referred
to
as
a
period
of
the
variety.
(B.)
Translation
into
the
p-adic
Case
Thus,
in
summary,
in
(A.)
we
saw
that
the
exponential
function
allows
us
to
give
a
natural
and
explicit
accounting
of
all
the
R-valued
solutions
of
such
equations
as
X
2
+Y
2
=
1
and
XY
=
1.
There
are
two
natural
ways
to
generalize
the
uniformization
theory
of
(A.).
The
most
obvious
is
to
ask
to
what
extent
it
may
be
generalized
to
more
general
types
of
equations,
i.e.,
more
general
types
of
varieties.
We
will
consider
such
questions
in
more
detail
in
(C.),
(D.)
and
(E.)
below.
Another
natural
way
to
attempt
to
generalize
the
theory
of
(A.)
is
to
ask:
To
what
extent
does
the
theory
of
(A.)
extend
to
ﬁelds
other
than
R?
For
instance,
since
the
exponential
function
et
is
deﬁned
not
only
for
t
∈
R,
but
for
all
t
∈
C,
it
is
not
diﬃcult
to
see
that
that
the
theory
of
(A.)
generalizes
immediately
to
the
ﬁeld
C
of
complex
numbers.
In
fact,
over
C,
one
sees
that
the
varieties
deﬁned
by
X
2
+
Y
2
=
1
and
XY
=
1
are
actually
the
same
variety.
Thus,
by
working
over
C,
one
sees
that
the
theory
of
(A.)
consists
essentially
of
one
case,
not
two.
Ultimately,
the
central
motivation
for
wanting
to
generalize
this
uniformization
theory
to
more
general
ﬁelds
arises
from
diophantine
geometry.
Indeed,
Diophantine
geometry
is
concerned
precisely
with
the
question
of
explicitly
cataloguing
all
solutions
of
equations
with
values
in
a
number
ﬁeld
(i.e.,
ﬁnite
extension
ﬁeld
of
Q).
Thus,
ideally,
if
one
had
a
complete
theory
of
uniformizations
(=
natural
explicit
catalogues
of
rational
points
of
a
variety)
over
an
arbitrary
number
ﬁeld,
such
as
Q,
then
(tautologically)
one
could
solve
the
most
central
question
of
diophantine
geometry,
i.e.,
of
cataloguing
all
rational
solutions
of
polynomial
equations.
At
the
present
time,
unfortunately,
there
does
not
yet
exist
such
a
theory
of
uniformizations
over
a
number
ﬁeld.
Nevertheless,
if
one
has
as
one’s
goal
the
realization
of
such
an
arithmetic
uniformization
theory,
it
is
natural
to
try
to
approximate
this
goal
by
ﬁrst
creating
a
theory
of
uniformizations
over
p-adic
ﬁelds.
For
instance,
if
one
has
such
a
theory
of
p-adic
uniformizations,
one
could
try
to
concoct
a
global
uniformization
theory
by
somehow
“gluing
together”
the
local
uniformization
theories
at
the
various
inﬁnite
(i.e.
“R”)
and
ﬁnite
(i.e.
p-adic)
primes.
2
Let
us
begin
by
looking
at
the
p-adic
analogue
of
the
theory
of
(A.).
Since
the
two
cases
treated
in
(A.)
are
really
one
case
(after
one
passes
to
an
appropriate
quadratic
extension
of
the
base
ﬁeld),
let
us,
for
simplicity,
treat
the
case
of
the
variety
Gm
=
Spec(Zp
[X,
X
−1
])
def
(i.e.,
the
variety
deﬁned
by
XY
=
1).
Note
that
Gm
has
a
natural
group
structure
(just
as
in
(A.)).
Moreover,
it
has
a
natural
invariant
diﬀerential
(so
called
because
the
diﬀerential
is
invariant
with
respect
to
translations
arising
from
the
group
structure)
def
dX
ω
=
X
If
one
tries
to
construct
the
uniformization
as
a
map
from
Gm
to
some
linear
space
(=
the
inverse
of
what
we
did
in
(A.)
–
i.e.,
the
logarithm
function),
one
sees
that
the
desired
uniformization
should
be
obtained
by
somehow
“integrating”
this
invariant
diﬀerential
ω
=
dX
X
.
Thus,
the
question
arises:
How
does
one
eﬀect
such
an
“integration”
of
ω
=
dX
X
in
the
p-adic
context?
To
understand
how
this
works,
let
us
ﬁrst
recall
that
in
the
classical
case
at
the
inﬁnite
prime,
“integration”
may
be
regarded
as
a
pairing
between
diﬀerentials
and
paths.
Moreover,
since
one’s
diﬀerentials
are
holomorphic,
this
pairing
only
depends
on
the
homotopy
class
of
a
path.
In
the
classical
case,
homotopy
classes
of
(closed)
paths
make
up
the
fundamental
group
of
(the
topological
space
underlying)
the
variety
in
question.
Thus,
in
the
p-adic
context,
it
is
natural
to
look
for
an
analogue
to
integration
in
the
form
of
a
pairing
between
diﬀerentials
and
some
sort
of
“p-adic
fundamental
group.”
What
do
we
mean
by
“p-adic
fundamental
group”?
In
the
classical
case,
the
fundamental
group
may
be
thought
of,
equivalently,
in
terms
of
homotopy
classes
of
paths
as
well
as
in
terms
of
automorphism
groups
of
coverings.
In
the
p-adic
case,
one
may
then
think
of
the
“p-adic
fundamental
group”
as
the
automorphisms
of
unramiﬁed
Galois
coverings
of
the
variety
in
question
whose
Galois
groups
are
(pro-)p-groups,
i.e.,
(inverse
limits
of)
ﬁnite
groups
of
order
a
power
of
p.
In
the
case
of
Gm
,
the
pairing
in
question
is
given
(roughly
speaking)
as
follows:
(1.)
First,
we
pull
back
the
diﬀerential
ω
via
the
covering
φn
:
Gm
⊗Zp
Zp
[ζn
]
−→
Gm
⊗Zp
Zp
[ζn
]
n
given
by
X
→
X
p
(where
n
is
a
positive
integer,
and
ζn
is
a
primitive
pn
-th
root
of
unity).
Here,
we
think
of
the
diﬀerential
ω
=
dX
X
∈
ΩGm
/Zp
as
deﬁning
a
diﬀerential
ωn
∈
ΩGm
⊗Zp
Zp
[ζn
]/Zp
.
3
(2.)
Then,
given
an
element
γ
of
the
Galois
group
of
the
above
covering,
we
consider
the
diﬀerence
p−n
{γ(φ∗n
ωn
)
−
φ∗n
ωn
}
∈
ΩZp
[ζn
]/Zp
If
one
considers
these
diﬀerences
over
all
n
(as
n
→
∞),
one
obtains
a
p-adic
pairing:
(p)
(Zp
·
ω)
⊗
π1
((Gm
)Q
)
→
Cp
(1)
p
Here,
Qp
is
an
algebraic
closure
of
Qp
;
Cp
is
the
p-adic
completion
of
Qp
;
and
the
“(1)”
following
the
Cp
is
a
“Tate
twist,”
i.e.,
if
we
think
of
all
the
objects
involved
as
being
def
equipped
with
a
natural
action
of
ΓQp
=
Gal(Qp
/Qp
),
then
the
“(1)”
means
that
the
given
action
(e.g.,
the
natural
action
on
Cp
)
is
twisted
by
the
action
of
the
cyclotomic
character
(p)
ΓZp
→
Zp
×
.
Finally,
π1
((Gm
)Q
)
is
the
(geometric)
“p-adic
fundamental
group”
of
Gm
p
discussed
above.
Since
essentially
all
the
coverings
that
make
up
this
fundamental
group
(p)
are
given
as
in
(1.)
above,
we
see
immediately
that
π1
((Gm
)Q
)
may
be
identiﬁed
with
p
Zp
(1).
Then
the
fundamental
theorem
here
(analogous
to
the
uniformization
theory
of
(A.))
is
that
this
pairing
deﬁnes
an
isomorphism
def
(p)
1
Cp
·
ω
∼
((Gm
)Q
,
Cp
(1))
=
HomZp
(π1
((Gm
)Q
),
Cp
(1))
=
Het
p
p
(where
the
“et”
stands
for
“étale
cohomology”).
Less
rigorously,
but
more
intuitively,
this
theorem
asserts
an
equivalence
n
dX
←→
{X
1/p
}n∈N
X
Here,
the
right-hand
side
denotes
the
“coverings
of
Gm
deﬁned
by
taking
p-power
roots
of
X.”
Note
that
both
sides
are
a
sort
of
representation
of
the
logarithm
function
–
which
is
natural
since
the
logarithm/exponential
function
is
fundamental
to
the
theory
of
(A.).
Namely,
the
left-hand
side
is
“the
derivative
of
the
logarithm
of
X”
while
the
right-hand
side,
at
least
from
a
“real/complex
analytic
point
of
view”
is
1+
1
log(X)
+
.
.
.
pn
In
fact,
in
the
p-adic
case,
one
can
deﬁne
a
natural
logarithm
function
log(X)
which
converges
in
a
small
p-adic
neighborhood
of
1
∈
Gm
(Zp
)
via
the
same
power
series
in
4
1
−
X
as
in
the
complex
case.
Then
the
derivative
of
this
function
will
be
equal
to
ω,
and
1
X
pn
can
be
written
as
the
same
power
series
in
log(X)
as
in
the
complex
case.
Moreover,
the
inverse
to
this
power
series
also
converges
in
a
suﬃciently
small
p-adic
neighborhood
(Cp
)≤
⊆
Cp
of
0
∈
Cp
and
deﬁnes
a
“uniformization
map”:
expGm
:
(Cp
)≤
→
Gm
(Cp
)
Yet
another
way
to
regard
this
fundamental
isomorphism
is
relative
to
the
above
discussion
of
integrating
ω
=
dX
X
along
(closed)
paths.
Since
we
are
dealing
with
the
fundamental
group
here,
our
paths
are,
in
fact,
closed,
and
so,
from
the
discussion
of
(A.),
we
should
expect
to
get
the
analogue
of
integrating
ω
along
closed
paths,
i.e.,
multiples
of
the
period
2πi.
Thus,
the
above
isomorphism
may
also
be
regarded
as
a
sort
“padic
period,”
or
“p-adic
version
of
2πi.”
This
is
precisely
the
point
of
view
of
p-adic
Hodge
theory.
Note
further
that
in
the
analytic
case,
if
we
consider
the
logarithm
function
def
log(X)
on
the
universal
covering
of
(Gm
)C
=
Spec(C[X,
X
−1
]),
and
let
γ
be
a
deck
transformation
of
this
universal
covering,
then
γ(log(X))
−
log(X)
is
a
multiple
of
the
period
2πi.
This
expression
γ(log(X))
−
log(X)
is
reminiscent
of
the
recipe
given
above
(cf.
(2.))
for
the
p-adic
period
map.
Finally,
before
proceeding,
we
note
that
if
instead
of
using
“Cp
”
coeﬃcients,
one
takes
∧
as
one’s
coeﬃcients
a
sort
of
very
large
ring
of
p-adic
functions
“RQp
,”
then
one
can
prove
a
similar
isomorphism
∧
∧
1
RQp
⊗OU
ΩU/Zp
∼
(U,
RQp
(1))
=
Het
for
any
suﬃciently
small
open
U
of
any
smooth
one-dimensional
(p-adic
formal)
scheme
X
over
Zp
.
This
is
the
content
of
Faltings’
theory
of
almost
étale
extensions
and
forms
the
basis
of
Faltings’
p-adic
Hodge
theory
([Falt2]).
(C.)
Elliptic
Curves
Now
we
come
to
the
question
of
generalizing
the
above
uniformization
theory
to
more
general
varieties.
So
far,
we
have
considered
the
case
of
varieties
in
the
plane
deﬁned
by
equations
of
degree
1
and
2.
The
next
case,
then,
to
consider
is
the
case
of
a
variety
in
the
plane
deﬁned
by
an
equation
of
degree
3.
Up
to
various
elementary
algebraic
operations
(such
as
adding
the
point
at
inﬁnity),
this
case
is
essentially
the
case
of
elliptic
curves,
i.e.,
(in
the
language
of
schemes)
smooth,
proper,
geometrically
connected
curves
of
genus
1.
Let
E
be
an
elliptic
curve
over
C.
Write
T
(E)
for
the
tangent
space
to
E
at
its
origin.
Thus,
T
(E)
is
a
one-dimensional
complex
vector
space.
Then
E
admits
a
natural
exponential
map:
expE
:
T
(E)
→
E
5
which
uniformizes
E.
If
one
chooses
an
appropriate
basis
of
T
(E),
then
this
uniformization
allows
one
to
write
E
in
the
form
C/Λ
def
def
where
Λ
=
Z
+
Z
·
τ
,
for
some
τ
∈
H
=
{z
∈
C|
Im(z)
>
0}.
Moreover,
we
observe
that
this
uniformization
of
E
also
induces
a
uniformization
of
the
moduli
space
(actually,
an
algebraic
stack)
of
elliptic
curves.
Indeed,
since
elliptic
curves
are
algebraic
objects,
this
moduli
space
M1,0
also
admits
a
natural
structure
of
algebraic
variety.
Thus,
the
correspondence
τ
(∈
H)
→
C/(Z
+
Z
·
τ
)
deﬁnes
a
uniformization
map
H
→
M1,0
This
map
induces
an
isomorphism
between
the
upper
half-plane
H
and
the
universal
covering
space
of
M1,0
(thought
of
as
a
stack).
Put
another
way,
this
map
gives
us
a
natural
coordinate
–
namely,
τ
–
on
(the
universal
cover
of)
M1,0
which
gives
us
an
explicit
catalogue
of
all
the
C-valued
points
M1,0
(C),
i.e.,
all
the
C-valued
solutions
of
the
polynomial
equations
deﬁning
the
algebraic
object
M1,0
.
Next,
we
observe
that
the
above
complex
theory
has
a
well-known
p-adic
analogue.
Namely,
just
as
in
(B.)
above,
we
considered
the
p-adic
Hodge
theory
of
Gm
,
one
may
also
consider
the
p-adic
Hodge
theory
of
elliptic
curves.
In
the
case
of
elliptic
curves,
however,
the
ﬁeld
Cp
is
not
suﬃcient
to
deﬁne
the
“p-adic
periods.”
Instead,
one
must
work
with
bigger
rings,
such
as
the
ring
Bcrys
of
Fontaine.
Let
E
be
an
elliptic
curve
over
a
ﬁnite
extension
K
of
Qp
.
For
simplicity,
let
us
assume
that
E
admits
an
extension
to
an
elliptic
curve
over
the
ring
of
integers
OK
.
One
then
obtains
an
isomorphism
(after
tensoring
up
to
Bcrys
)
1
1
HDR
(E,
OE
)
⊗K
Bcrys
∼
(E,
Qp
)
⊗Qp
Bcrys
=
Het
between
the
de
Rham
and
étale
cohomologies
(in
dimension
one)
of
the
elliptic
curve.
Here
the
de
Rham
cohomology
H
1
(E,
OE
)
of
E
may
be
thought
of
as
the
analogue
for
an
elliptic
curve
of
the
one-dimensional
space
generated
by
the
invariant
diﬀerential
dX
X
in
the
case
1
of
Gm
.
The
étale
cohomology
Het
(E,
Qp
)
may
be
thought
of
as
(p)
HomZp
(π1
(EK
),
Qp
)
def
(p)
where
EK
=
E
⊗K
K;
K
is
an
algebraic
closure
of
K;
and
π1
(EK
)
is
the
“geometric
1
(E,
Qp
)
is
equipped
p-adic
fundamental
group
of
E.”
This
étale
cohomology
module
Het
6
def
with
a
natural
action
of
the
Galois
group
ΓK
=
Gal(K/K).
Thus,
the
above
comparison
isomorphism
may
be
regarded
as
asserting
an
equivalence
between
the
de
Rham
cohomology
(equipped
with
certain
natural
auxiliary
structures
like
the
Hodge
ﬁltration
and
Frobenius
action)
and
the
étale
cohomology
(equipped
with
its
Galois
action)
of
E.
The
p-adic
Hodge
theory
of
an
elliptic
curve
is
easiest
to
understand
in
the
ordinary
case.
This
is
the
case
where
the
reduction
modulo
mK
(=
the
maximal
ideal
of
OK
)
of
the
elliptic
curve
has
a
nonzero
Hasse
invariant.
Another
equivalent
characterization
is
that
the
Cartier
operator
on
the
invariant
diﬀerentials
of
the
reduction
modulo
p
is
bijective.
It
turns
out
that
in
some
sense,
“most”
elliptic
curves
are
ordinary.
In
the
ordinary
case,
the
def
def
1
(E,
Zp
(1))
ﬁts
into
an
exact
sequence
of
ΓK
-modules
ΓK
=
Gal(K/K)-module
M
=
Het
0
→
M1
→
M
→
M0
→
0
where
M1
and
M0
are
Zp
-modules
of
rank
1.
If
one
then
restricts
from
K
to
the
p-adic

unr
of
the
maximal
unramiﬁed
extension
of
K,
then
the
following

This
isomorphism
respects
the
group

on
E
and
Gm
.

The
resulting

-modules
M1
and
M0
become
isomorphic
to
Zp

In
other
words,
(by
composing
the
isomorphism
of

above
with

)
one
may
regard
(1.)
as
a
sort
of
p-adic
analogue
of
the
uniformization
of
an
elliptic
curve
over
the
complex
numbers,
while
the
bijection
of
(2.)
(which
is
in
some
sense
induced
by
“pushing
forward”
the
uniformization
of
(1.))
may
be
regarded
as
a
local
p-adic
uniformization
of
the
moduli
space
M1,0
of
elliptic
curves,
hence
as
a
sort
of
p-adic
analogue
of
the
uniformization
of
M1,0
(over
C)
by
the
upper
half-plane
H.
The
bijection
of
(2.)
is
often
referred
to
as
Serre-Tate
theory
for
ordinary
elliptic
curves.

(D.)
The
Notion
of
Intrinsic
Hodge
Theory
Next,
we
would
like
to
see
to
what
extent
the
theory
discussed
so
far
may
be
generalized
to
plane
curves
of
degree
>
3,
and,
more
generally,
to
arbitrary
varieties.
Before
we
discuss
this
generalization,
however,
we
must
consider
in
more
detail
precisely
what
we
would
like
to
generalize.
That
is
to
say,
because
the
examples
we
have
considered
so
far
are
relatively
simple,
they
have
many
diﬀerent
aspects.
Thus,
when
one
wishes
to
consider
generalizations,
one
must
specify
which
aspects
one
wants
the
generalizations
to
retain
and
which
aspects
one
is
willing
to
sacriﬁce
as
“inessential”
when
one
generalizes.
One
central
aspect
of
both
the
complex
and
p-adic
theories
that
we
have
discussed
so
far
is
that
they
involve
some
sort
of
comparison
or
equivalence
between
what
one
might
call
the
“de
Rham
world”
(of
polynomials
and
their
diﬀerentials)
and
the
“topology/geometry
world”
(over
C)
or
the
“p-adic
étale
topology
plus
Galois
action
world”
(in
the
p-adic
case).
This
sort
of
equivalence,
or
comparison
isomorphism,
algebraic
geometry
⇐⇒
topology+
(diﬀerential)
geometry/p-adic
étale
topology
plus
Galois
action
is
the
main
theme
of
(both
complex
and
p-adic)
Hodge
theory.
The
most
basic
example
of
such
a
comparison
isomorphism,
or
Hodge
theory,
is
(in
the
complex
case)
the
de
Rham
isomorphism
between
de
Rham
and
singular
cohomology,
or
(in
the
p-adic
case)
the
isomorphism
(over
such
rings
as
Bcrys
)
between
the
algebraic
de
Rham
cohomology
and
the
p-adic
étale
cohomology
(with
Galois
action).
This
Hodge
theory
of
cohomologies
is
thus
a
direct
generalization
of
the
comparison
isomorphisms
discussed
above
in
(B.)
and
(C.).
In
fact,
although
there
now
exist
a
number
of
proofs
of
the
main
theorems
of
p-adic
Hodge
theory,
one
proof
(due
to
Faltings
–
[Falt3])
is
based
precisely
on
the
local
isomorphism
∧
∧
1
RQp
⊗OU
ΩU/Zp
∼
(U,
RQp
(1))
=
Het
discussed
at
the
end
of
(B.).
Namely,
the
comparison
isomorphism
in
the
general
case
(for
varieties
of
arbitrary
dimension)
is
obtained
by
essentially
gluing
together
products
of
the
above
local
isomorphism
applied
to
suﬃciently
small
opens
of
a
given
variety
over
a
p-adic
ﬁeld.
In
the
present
discussion,
however,
we
wish
to
consider
a
diﬀerent
type
of
generalization.
That
is
to
say,
although
we
still
want
the
generalization
to
be
some
sort
of
Hodge
theory,
i.e.,
some
sort
of
equivalence
as
discussed
above,
we
would
like
to
consider
Hodge
theories
for
which
the
object
appearing
on
the
algebraic
geometry
side
is
(not
some
cohomology
module
associated
to
the
given
variety,
but)
the
“variety
itself,”
i.e.,
the
rational
points
or
moduli
of
the
given
variety.
That
is
to
say,
although
it
just
so
happened
that
in
the
case
of
relatively
simple
varieties
like
Gm
or
elliptic
curves,
the
“variety
itself”
happened
to
be
essentially
embodied
in
its
ﬁrst
cohomology
module
(in
more
fancy
language:
elliptic
curves
and
Gm
“are”
1-motives),
in
general,
the
cohomology
modules
of
a
8
given
variety
only
embody
certain
limited
aspects
of
the
variety,
and
are
not
“essentially
equivalent”
to
the
“variety
itself.”
In
the
following,
we
shall
refer
to
Hodge
theories
of
the
“variety
itself”
as
intrinsic
Hodge
theories,
or
IHT’s
for
short
(to
be
distinguished
from
the
more
classical
“Hodge
theories
of
cohomologies”).
Those
intrinsic
Hodge
theories
for
which
the
expression
“variety
itself”
turns
out
to
mean
“the
rational
points
of
the
variety”
will
be
called
physical
(since
they
give
a
new
way
to
“physically
recover
the
variety”),
while
those
intrinsic
Hodge
theories
for
which
the
expression
“variety
itself”
is
used
to
mean
“the
moduli
of
the
variety”
will
be
called
modular.
If
one
thinks
back
to
our
discussion
of
uniformizations
of
algebraic
varieties
as
natural
“geometric”
(our
translation
for
“linear”
in
the
general
case)
catalogues
of
all
rational
points,
one
sees
that
it
is
essentially
a
tautology
of
terminology
that
physical
IHT
⇐⇒
uniformization
theory
of
the
given
variety
modular
IHT
⇐⇒
uniformization
theory
of
the
moduli
space
of
the
given
variety
Nonetheless,
although
we
will
be
concerned
with
a
diﬀerent
sort
of
generalization
of
the
theory
of
(A.),
(B.),
and
(C.)
from
the
classical
Hodge
theory
of
cohomologies,
the
techniques
that
will
be
employed
in
the
proofs
of
the
main
theorems
that
we
will
discuss
in
II.
and
III.
below
will
be
based
on
the
techniques
of
(cohomological)
p-adic
Hodge
theory
(as
in
[Falt2,3]).
(E.)
Curves
of
Higher
Genus:
the
Fuchsian
Uniformization
Finally,
we
come
to
the
case
of
plane
curves
of
higher
(i.e.,
>
1)
genus,
or,
more
generally,
hyperbolic
curves.
A
hyperbolic
curve
is
an
algebraic
curve
obtained
by
removing
r
points
from
a
smooth,
proper
curve
of
genus
g,
where
g
and
r
are
nonnegative
integers
such
that
2g
−
2
+
r
>
0.
If
X
is
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
the
ﬁeld
of
complex
numbers
C,
then
X
gives
rise
in
a
natural
way
to
a
Riemann
surface
X
.
As
one
knows
from
complex
analysis,
the
most
fundamental
fact
concerning
such
a
Riemann
surface
(due
to
Köbe)
is
that
it
may
be
uniformized
by
the
upper
half-plane,
i.e.,
X
∼
=
H/Γ
def
where
H
=
{z
∈
C
|
Im(z)
>
0},
and
Γ
∼
=
π1
(X
)
(the
topological
fundamental
group
of
X
)
is
a
discontinuous
group
acting
on
H.
This
uniformization
is
referred
to
as
the
Fuchsian
uniformization
of
X
.
Thus,
one
sees
immediately
that
the
Fuchsian
uniformization,
i.e.,
X(C)
∼
=
H/Γ
may
be
regarded
as
being
a
physical
IHT
of
the
hyperbolic
curve
X.
9
This
is
not
the
only
way
to
interpret
the
Fuchsian
uniformization,
however.
That
is
to
say,
it
also
has
a
modular
aspect,
as
follows.
First,
note
that
the
action
of
Γ
on
H
deﬁnes
a
canonical
representation
def
ρX
:
π1
(X
)
→
P
SL2
(R)
=
SL2
(R)/{±1}
=
AutHolomorphic
(H)
Note
that
ρX
may
also
be
regarded
as
a
representation
into
P
GL2
(C)
=
GL2
(C)/C×
,
hence
as
deﬁning
an
action
of
π1
(X
)
on
P1C
.
Taking
the
quotient
of
H
×
P1C
by
the
action
of
π1
(X
)
on
both
factors
then
gives
rise
to
a
projective
bundle
with
connection
on
X
.
It
is
immediate
that
this
projective
bundle
and
connection
may
be
algebraized,
so
we
thus
obtain
a
projective
bundle
and
connection
(P
→
X,
∇P
)
on
X.
This
pair
(P,
∇P
)
has
certain
properties
which
make
it
an
indigenous
bundle
(terminology
due
to
Gunning).
More
generally,
an
indigenous
bundle
on
X
may
be
thought
of
as
a
projective
structure
on
X
,
i.e.,
a
subsheaf
of
the
sheaf
of
holomorphic
functions
on
X
such
that
locally
any
two
sections
of
this
subsheaf
are
related
by
a
linear
fractional
transformation.
Thus,
the
Fuchsian
uniformization
deﬁnes
a
special
canonical
indigenous
bundle
on
X.
In
fact,
the
notion
of
an
indigenous
bundle
is
entirely
algebraic.
Thus,
one
has
a
natural
moduli
stack
Sg,r
→
Mg,r
of
indigenous
bundles,
which
forms
a
torsor
(under
the
aﬃne
group
given
by
the
sheaf
of
diﬀerentials
on
Mg,r
)
–
called
the
Schwarz
torsor
–
over
the
moduli
stack
Mg,r
of
hyperbolic
curves
of
type
(g,
r).
Moreover,
Sg,r
is
not
only
algebraic,
it
is
deﬁned
over
Z[
12
].
Thus,
the
canonical
indigenous
bundle
deﬁnes
a
canonical
real
analytic
section
s
:
Mg,r
(C)
→
Sg,r
(C)
of
the
Schwarz
torsor
at
the
inﬁnite
prime.
Moreover,
not
only
does
s
“contain”
all
the
information
that
one
needs
to
deﬁne
the
Fuchsian
uniformization
of
an
individual
hyperbolic
curve
(indeed,
this
much
is
obvious
from
the
deﬁnition
of
s!),
it
also
essentially
“is”
(interpreted
properly)
the
Bers
uniformization
of
the
universal
covering
space
(i.e.,
“Teichmüller
space”)
of
Mg,r
(C)
(cf.
the
discussions
in
the
Introductions
of
[Mzk1,4]
for
more
details).
That
is
to
say,
the
study
of
this
canonical
section
s
may
be
regarded
as
the
realization
of
the
Fuchsian
uniformization
as
a
modular
IHT.
Alternatively,
from
the
point
of
view
of
classical
Teichmüller
theory,
one
may
regard
the
uniformization
theory
of
the
moduli
of
hyperbolic
curves
as
the
theory
of
(so-called)
quasi-fuchsian
deformations
of
the
representation
ρX
.
In
II.
and
III.
below,
we
wish
to
discuss
p-adic
analogues
of
the
above
physical
and
modular
IHT’s
for
complex
hyperbolic
curves.
At
this
point,
the
reader
might
ask
if
we
can
continue
in
this
fashion
to
obtain
IHT’s
for
arbitrary
algebraic
varieties.
Unfortunately,
however,
even
over
C
(where
things
tend
to
be
much
better
understood
than
in
the
p-adic
case),
the
uniformization
and
moduli
theory
of
algebraic
varieties
of
dimension
≥
2
is
far
from
being
well-understood.
Thus,
in
the
present
manuscript,
we
shall
restrict
our
attention
to
curves.

II.
The
Anabelian
Geometry
of
Hyperbolic
Curves
(A.)
Grothendieck’s
Anabelian
Philosophy
Let
K
be
a
ﬁeld
of
characteristic
zero.
Let
us
denote
by
K
an
algebraic
closure
of
K.
def
Let
ΓK
=
Gal(K/K).
Suppose
that
XK
is
a
variety
over
K.
Then
we
will
denote
by
π1
(XK
)
the
algebraic
fundamental
group
of
XK
(cf.
[SGA1]).
This
group
is
a
compact,
proﬁnite
topological
group,
well-deﬁned
up
to
inner
automorphism
(since
we
did
not
specify
a
“base-point”),
and
which
has
the
following
property:
The
category
of
ﬁnite
sets
with
a
continuous
π1
(XK
)-action
is
naturally
equivalent
to
the
category
of
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
XK
.
Moreover,
if
K
is,
for
instance,
an
algebraically
closed
subﬁeld
of
C,
then
π1
(XK
)
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
proﬁnite
completion
(=
inverse
limit
of
all
ﬁnite
quotients)
of
def
the
usual
topological
fundamental
group
π1top
(XC
)
(where
XC
=
XK
⊗K
C).
def
Now
let
XK
be
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
K;
write
XK
=
X
×K
K.
Then
one
has
an
exact
sequence
1
→
π1
(XK
)
→
π1
(XK
)
→
ΓK
→
1
of
algebraic
fundamental
groups.
We
shall
refer
to
π1
(XK
)
as
the
geometric
fundamental
group
of
XK
.
Note
that,
by
the
above
discussion
of
the
case
where
K
⊆
C,
it
follows
that
the
structure
of
π1
(XK
)
is
determined
entirely
by
(g,
r)
(i.e.,
the
“type”
of
the
hyperbolic
curve
XK
).
In
particular,
π1
(XK
)
does
not
depend
on
the
moduli
of
XK
.
Of
course,
this
results
from
the
fact
that
K
is
of
characteristic
zero.
In
positive
characteristic,
on
the
other
hand,
preliminary
evidence
([Tama2])
suggests
that
the
fundamental
group
of
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
(far
from
being
independent
of
the
moduli
of
the
curve!)
may
in
fact
completely
determine
the
moduli
of
the
curve.
We
shall
refer
to
π1
(XK
)
(equipped
with
its
augmentation
to
ΓK
)
as
the
arithmetic
fundamental
group
of
XK
.
Although
it
is
made
up
of
two
“parts”
–
i.e.,
π1
(XK
)
and
ΓK
–
which
do
not
depend
on
the
moduli
of
XK
,
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
expect
that
the
extension
class
deﬁned
by
the
above
exact
sequence,
i.e.,
the
structure
of
π1
(XK
)
as
a
group
equipped
with
augmentation
to
ΓK
,
may
in
fact
depend
quite
strongly
on
the
moduli
of
XK
.
Indeed,
according
to
the
anabelian
philosophy
of
Grothendieck
(cf.
[LS]),
for
“suﬃciently
arithmetic”
K,
one
expects
that
the
structure
of
the
arithmetic
fundamental
group
π1
(XK
)
should
be
enough
to
determine
the
moduli
of
XK
.
Although
many
important
versions
of
Grothendieck’s
anabelian
conjectures
remain
unsolved
(most
notably
the
so-called
Section
Conjecture
(cf.,
e.g.,
[LS],
p.
289,
2)),
in
the
remainder
of
this
§,
we
shall
discuss
various
versions
that
have
been
resolved
in
the
aﬃrmative.
For
instance,
such
a
version
of
these
conjectures
which
will
be
discussed
in
(B.)
below
(Theorem
1)
11
states
roughly
that
(nonconstant)
morphisms
from
a
smooth
K-variety
to
XK
should
be
in
bijective
correspondence
with
(open)
homomorphisms
(over
ΓK
)
between
the
corresponding
arithmetic
fundamental
groups.
Thus,
there
is
an
obvious
analogy
between
this
(form
of
Grothendieck’s)
conjecture
and
the
Tate
conjecture
on
abelian
varieties,
which
states
roughly
that
morphisms
between
abelian
varieties
are
equivalent
to
morphisms
between
their
arithmetic
fundamental
groups.
Note
that
this
anabelian
philosophy
is
a
special
case
of
the
notion
of
“intrinsic
Hodge
theory”
discussed
above:
indeed,
on
the
algebraic
geometry
side,
one
has
“the
curve
itself,”
whereas
on
the
topology
plus
arithmetic
side,
one
has
the
arithmetic
fundamental
group,
i.e.,
the
purely
(étale)
topological
π1
(XK
),
equipped
with
the
structure
of
extension
given
by
the
above
exact
sequence.
In
fact,
it
is
interesting
to
note
–
especially
relative
to
the
discussion
at
the
beginning
of
I.,
(B.),
above
–
that
Grothendieck’s
anabelian
philosophy
arose
as
an
approach
to
diophantine
geometry.
It
is
primarily
for
this
reason
that
it
was
originally
thought
that
the
most
natural
sort
of
“arithmetic”
base
ﬁeld
K
over
which
one
should
expect
Grothendieck’s
anabelian
conjectures
to
hold
was
a
number
ﬁeld.
Another
reason
for
the
idea
that
the
base
ﬁeld
in
these
conjectures
should
be
a
number
ﬁeld
was
the
analogy
with
Tate’s
conjecture
on
homomorphisms
between
abelian
varieties
(cf.,
e.g.,
[Falt1]).
Indeed,
in
discussions
of
Grothendieck’s
anabelian
philosophy,
it
was
common
to
refer
to
statements
such
as
that
of
Theorem
1
below
as
the
“anabelian
Tate
conjecture,”
or
the
“Tate
conjecture
for
hyperbolic
curves.”
In
fact,
however,
there
is
an
important
diﬀerence
between
Theorem
1
and
the
“Tate
conjecture”
of,
say,
[Falt1]:
Namely,
whereas
Theorem
1
below
holds
over
local
ﬁelds
(i.e.,
ﬁnite
extensions
of
Qp
),
the
Tate
conjecture
for
abelian
varieties
is
false
over
local
ﬁelds.
Moreover,
until
the
proof
of
Theorem
1,
it
was
generally
thought
that,
just
like
its
abelian
cousin,
the
“anabelian
Tate
conjecture”
was
essentially
global
in
nature.
That
is
to
say,
it
appears
that
the
point
of
view
of
the
author,
i.e.,
that
Theorem
1
should
be
regarded
as
a
p-adic
version
of
the
“physical
aspect”
of
the
Fuchsian
uniformization
of
a
hyperbolic
curve,
does
not
exist
in
the
literature
(prior
to
the
work
of
the
author).
(B.)
The
Main
Result
Building
on
earlier
work
of
H.
Nakamura
and
A.
Tamagawa
(see,
especially,
[Tama1]),
the
author
applied
the
p-adic
Hodge
theory
of
[Falt2]
and
[BK]
to
prove
the
following
result
(cf.
Theorem
A
of
[Mzk5]):
Theorem
1.
Let
p
be
a
prime
number.
Let
K
be
a
subﬁeld
of
a
ﬁnitely
generated
ﬁeld
extension
of
Qp
.
Let
XK
be
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
K.
Then
for
any
smooth
variety
SK
over
K,
the
natural
map
XK
(SK
)dom
→
Homopen
ΓK
(π1
(SK
),
π1
(XK
))
is
bijective.
Here,
the
superscripted
“dom”
denotes
dominant
(⇐⇒
nonconstant)
Kmorphisms,
while
Homopen
ΓK
denotes
open,
continuous
homomorphisms
compatible
with
the
12
augmentations
to
ΓK
,
and
considered
up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
arising
from
π1
(XK
).
Note
that
this
result
constitutes
an
analogue
of
the
“physical
aspect”
of
the
Fuchsian
uniformization,
i.e.,
it
exhibits
the
scheme
XK
(in
the
sense
of
the
functor
deﬁned
by
considering
(nonconstant)
K-morphisms
from
arbitrary
smooth
SK
to
XK
)
as
equivalent
to
the
“physical/analytic
object”
Homopen
ΓK
(−,
π1
(XK
))
deﬁned
by
the
topological
π1
(XK
)
together
with
some
additional
canonical
arithmetic
structure
(i.e.,
π1
(XK
)).
In
fact,
various
slightly
stronger
versions
of
Theorem
1
hold.
For
instance,
instead
of
the
whole
geometric
fundamental
group
π1
(XK
),
it
suﬃces
to
consider
its
maximal
pro-p
quotient
π1
(XK
)(p)
.
Indeed,
this
“π1
(XK
)(p)
”
is
the
precise
deﬁnition
of
what
was
meant
by
the
expression
“p-adic
fundamental
group”
in
the
discussion
of
I.,
(B.).
Another
strengthening
allows
one
to
prove
the
following
result
(cf.
Theorem
B
of
[Mzk5]),
which
generalizes
a
result
of
Pop
([Pop]):
Theorem
2.
Let
p
be
a
prime
number.
Let
K
be
a
subﬁeld
of
a
ﬁnitely
generated
ﬁeld
extension
of
Qp
.
Let
L
and
M
be
function
ﬁelds
of
arbitrary
dimension
over
K.
Then
the
natural
map
HomK
(Spec(L),
Spec(M
))
→
Homopen
ΓK
(ΓL
,
ΓM
)
is
bijective.
Here,
Homopen
ΓK
(ΓL
,
ΓM
)
is
the
set
of
open,
continuous
group
homomorphisms
ΓL
→
ΓM
over
ΓK
,
considered
up
to
composition
with
an
inner
homomorphism
arising
from
Ker(ΓM
→
ΓK
).
(C.)
The
Idea
of
the
Proof
To
understand
the
proof
of
Theorem
1,
let
us
ﬁrst
recall
the
situation
in
the
complex
case.
If
X
is
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
C,
then
as
discussed
in
I.,
(E.),
we
have
an
isomorphism
X(C)
∼
=
H/Γ
One
way
to
think
of
this
isomorphism
is
as
the
datum
of
an
algebraic
structure
(i.e.,
the
structure
of
X
as
an
algebraic
curve)
on
the
analytic
quotient
H/Γ.
In
complex
analysis,
this
sort
of
algebraic
structure
is
typically
constructed
by
starting
with
the
upper
halfplane
H,
and
then
constructing
various
automorphic
forms
on
H,
i.e.,
diﬀerential
forms
on
13
H
that
are
invariant
with
respect
to
the
natural
action
of
Γ.
These
diﬀerential
forms
then
deﬁne
a
morphism
H→P
from
H
to
some
projective
space
P
whose
image
is
precisely
the
algebraic
curve
X.
The
point
here
is
that
although
the
automorphic
forms
that
one
constructs
on
H
will
eventially
be
seen
to
be
“algebraic”
(i.e.,
as
diﬀerential
forms
on
X),
their
construction
(as
diﬀerentials
forms
on
H)
is
entirely
analytic.
Note
that
this
technique
of
constructing
an
algebraic
structure
on
an
analytic
quotient
appears
frequently
in
the
theory
of
Shimura
varieties
(where
the
automorphic
forms
are
Poincaré
series,
Eisenstein
series,
etc.).
It
is
precisely
this
analytic
argument
that
was
the
motivating
idea
behind
the
p-adic
proof
of
Theorem
1.
Indeed,
suppose
that
one
is
given
two
hyperbolic
curves
XK
,
YK
over
K.
For
simplicity,
let
us
assume
that
both
XK
and
YK
are
both
proper
and
nonhyperelliptic,
and
that
K
is
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
.
Suppose,
moreover,
that
we
are
given
an
isomorphism
α
:
π1
(XK
)
∼
=
π1
(YK
)
of
the
respective
arithmetic
fundamental
groups
which
is
compatible
with
the
projections
to
ΓK
.
Then
Theorem
1
states
that
α
necessarily
arises
geometrically,
i.e.,
from
a
Kisomorphism
XK
∼
=
YK
.
In
the
following,
we
would
like
to
give
a
rough
sketch
of
the
ideas
used
to
prove
this
result.
First,
observe
that
α
induces
an
isomorphism
π1
(XK
)ab
∼
=
π1
(YK
)ab
(p)
(p)
between
the
abelianizations
of
the
maximal
pro-p
quotients
of
the
respective
geometric
fundamental
groups.
Then
it
follows
from
p-adic
Hodge
theory
that
if
one
tensors
this
isomorphism
with
Cp
(i.e,
the
p-adic
completion
of
K),
and
then
takes
ΓK
-invariants,
def
one
obtains
(naturally)
on
both
sides
the
respective
spaces
of
global
diﬀerentials,
DX
=
def
H
0
(XK
,
ωXK
)
and
DY
=
H
0
(YK
,
ωYK
).
Thus,
one
obtains
an
isomorphism
DX
∼
=
DY
def
def
induced
by
α.
Let
PX
=
P(DX
),
PY
=
P(DY
)
be
the
corresponding
projective
spaces.
Thus,
one
obtains
an
isomorphism
PX
∼
=
PY
.
On
the
other
hand,
since
we
assumed
that
XK
and
YK
are
non-hyperelliptic,
it
follows
from
elementary
algebraic
geometry
that
we
have
canonical
embeddings
XK
⊆
PX
,
YK
⊆
PY
.
In
other
words,
we
have
a
diagram:
14
PX
∼
=
XK
−→
YK
PY
?
Thus,
the
problem
of
constructing
an
isomorphism
XK
∼
=
YK
as
desired
is
reduced
to
∼
showing
that
the
isomorphism
PX
=
PY
that
we
have
already
constructed
maps
XK
into
YK
.
This
is
proven
precisely
by
considering
certain
p-adic
analytic
representations
of
the
diﬀerentials
of
DX
and
DY
as
diﬀerentials
on
a
certain
p-adic
space
(=
the
spectrum
of
a
certain
large
p-adic
ﬁeld)
in
a
fashion
reminiscent
of
the
way
in
which
analytic
representations
(i.e.,
automorphic
forms)
of
diﬀerential
forms
appeared
in
the
above
discussion
of
the
complex
case.
We
refer
to
[Mzk5],
[NTM],
for
more
details.
III.
Teichmüller
Theory
over
the
p-adics
(A.)
The
Motivating
Example:
Shimura
Curves
As
discussed
in
I.,
(E.),
classical
complex
Teichmüller
theory
may
be
formulated
as
the
study
of
the
canonical
real
analytic
section
s
of
the
Schwarz
torsor
Sg,r
→
Mg,r
.
Thus,
it
is
natural
to
suppose
that
the
p-adic
analogue
of
classical
Teichmüller
theory
should
revolve
around
some
sort
of
canonical
p-adic
section
of
the
Schwarz
torsor.
Then
the
question
arises:
How
does
one
deﬁne
a
canonical
p-adic
section
of
the
Schwarz
torsor?
Put
another
way,
for
each
(or
at
least
most)
p-adic
hyperbolic
curves,
we
would
like
to
associate
a
(or
at
least
a
ﬁnite,
bounded
number
of)
canonical
indigenous
bundles.
Thus,
we
would
like
to
know
what
sort
of
properties
such
a
“canonical
indigenous
bundle”
should
have.
The
model
that
provides
the
answer
to
this
question
is
the
theory
of
Shimura
curves.
In
fact,
the
theory
of
canonical
Schwarz
structures,
canonical
diﬀerentials,
and
canonical
coordinates
on
Shimura
curves
localized
at
ﬁnite
primes
has
been
extensively
studied
by
Y.
Ihara
(see,
e.g.,
[Ihara]).
In
some
sense,
Ihara’s
theory
provides
the
prototype
for
the
“p-adic
Teichmüller
theory”
of
arbitrary
hyperbolic
curves
([Mzk1-4])
to
be
discussed
in
(B.)
and
(C.)
below.
The
easiest
example
of
a
Shimura
curve
is
M1,0
,
the
moduli
stack
of
elliptic
curves.
In
this
case,
the
projectivization
of
the
rank
two
bundle
on
M1,0
deﬁned
by
the
ﬁrst
de
Rham
cohomology
module
of
the
universal
elliptic
curve
on
M1,0
gives
rise
(when
equipped
with
the
Gauss-Manin
connection)
to
the
canonical
indigenous
bundle
on
M1,0
.
Moreover,
it
is
well-known
that
the
p-curvature
(a
canonical
invariant
of
bundles
with
connection
in
positive
characteristic
which
measures
the
extent
to
which
the
connection
is
compatible
with
Frobenius)
of
this
bundle
has
the
following
property:
The
p-curvature
of
the
canonical
indigenous
bundle
on
M1,0
(reduced
mod
p)
is
square
nilpotent.
It
was
this
observation
that
was
the
key
to
the
development
of
the
theory
of
[Mzk1-4].
15
(B.)
The
Characteristic
p
Theory
Let
p
be
an
odd
prime.
Let
Ng,r
⊆
(Sg,r
)Fp
denote
the
closed
algebraic
substack
of
indigenous
bundles
with
square
nilpotent
p-curvature.
Then
one
has
the
following
key
result
([Mzk1],
Chapter
II,
Theorem
2.3):
Theorem
3.
The
natural
map
Ng,r
→
(Mg,r
)Fp
is
a
ﬁnite,
ﬂat,
local
complete
intersection
morphism
of
degree
p3g−3+r
.
Thus,
up
to
“isogeny”
(i.e.,
up
to
the
fact
that
this
degree
is
not
equal
to
one),
Ng,r
deﬁnes
a
canonical
section
of
the
Schwarz
torsor
(Sg,r
)Fp
→
(Mg,r
)Fp
in
characteristic
p.
It
is
this
stack
Ng,r
of
nilcurves
–
i.e.,
hyperbolic
curves
in
characteristic
p
equipped
with
an
indigenous
bundle
with
square
nilpotent
p-curvature
–
which
is
the
central
object
of
study
in
the
theory
of
[Mzk1-4].
Many
facts
are
now
known
about
the
ﬁner
structure
of
Ng,r
.
One
interesting
consequence
of
this
structure
theory
of
Ng,r
is
that
it
gives
a
new
proof
of
the
connectedness
of
(Mg,r
)Fp
(for
p
large
relative
to
g).
This
fact
is
interesting
–
relative
to
the
claim
that
this
theory
is
a
p-adic
version
of
Teichmüller
theory
–
in
that
one
of
the
ﬁrst
applications
of
classical
complex
Teichmüller
theory
is
to
prove
the
connectedness
of
Mg,r
.
Also,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
F.
Oort
has
succeeded
in
giving
a
proof
of
the
connnectedness
of
the
moduli
stack
of
principally
polarized
abelian
varieties
by
applying
the
structure
theory
of
certain
natural
substacks
of
this
moduli
stack
in
characteristic
p.
(C.)
Canonical
Liftings
So
far,
we
have
been
discussing
the
characteristic
p
theory.
Ultimately,
however,
we
would
like
to
know
if
the
various
characteristic
p
objects
discussed
in
(B.)
lift
canonically
to
objects
which
are
ﬂat
over
Zp
.
Unfortunately,
it
seems
that
it
is
unlikely
that
Ng,r
itself
lifts
canonically
to
some
sort
of
natural
Zp
-ﬂat
object.
If,
however,
we
consider
the
ord
open
substack
–
called
the
ordinary
locus
–
(Ng,r
)Fp
⊆
Ng,r
which
is
the
étale
locus
of
the
morphism
Ng,r
→
(Mg,r
)Fp
,
then
(since
the
étale
site
is
invariant
under
nilpotent
thickenings)
we
get
a
canonical
lifting,
i.e.,
an
étale
morphism
ord
→
(Mg,r
)Zp
Ng,r
ord
of
p-adic
formal
stacks.
Over
Ng,r
,
one
has
the
sought-after
canonical
p-adic
splitting
of
the
Schwarz
torsor
(cf.
Theorem
0.1
of
the
Introduction
of
[Mzk1]):
ord
ord
→
Sg,r
of
the
Schwarz
torsor
over
Ng,r
Theorem
4.
There
is
a
canonical
section
Ng,r
which
is
the
unique
section
having
the
following
property:
There
exists
a
lifting
of
Frobenius
ord
ord
→
Ng,r
such
that
the
indigenous
bundle
on
the
tautological
hyperbolic
curve
ΦN
:
Ng,r
ord
ord
over
Ng,r
deﬁned
by
the
section
Ng,r
→
Sg,r

respect
to
the
Frobenius
action
deﬁned
by
ΦN
.

Moreover,
it
turns
out
that
the

lifting
ΦN

Ng,r
→
Ng,r
(i.e.,
morphism
whose
reduction
modulo
p
is
the
Frobenius
morphism)
has
the
special
property
that
p1
·dΦN
∼
induces
an
isomorphism
Φ∗N
ΩNg,r
ord
=
ΩN
ord
.
Such
a
Frobenius
lifting
is
called
ordinary.
It
g,r
turns
out
that
any
ordinary
Frobenius
lifting
(i.e.,
not
just
ΦN
)
deﬁnes
a
set
of
canonical
multiplicative
coordinates
in
a
formal
neighborhood
of
any
point
α
valued
in
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
k
of
characteristic
p,
as
well
as
a
canonical
lifting
of
α
to
a
point
valued
in
W
(k)
(Witt
vectors
with
coeﬃcients
in
k).
Moreover,
there
is
a
certain
analogy
between
this
general
theory
of
ordinary
Frobenius
liftings
and
the
theory
of
real
analytic
Kähler
metrics
(which
also
deﬁne
canonical
coordinates).
Relative
to
this
analogy,
the
ord
canonical
Frobenius
lifting
ΦN
on
Ng,r
may
be
regarded
as
corresponding
to
the
WeilPetersson
metric
on
complex
Teichmüller
space
(a
metric
whose
canonical
coordinates
are
the
coordinates
arising
from
the
Bers
uniformization
of
Teichmüller
space).
Thus,
ΦN
is,
in
a
very
real
sense,
a
p-adic
analogue
of
the
Bers
uniformization
in
the
complex
case.
Moreover,
there
is,
in
fact,
a
canonical
ordinary
Frobenius
lifting
on
the
“ordinary
locus”
ord
whose
relative
canonical
coordinate
is
analogous
to
the
of
the
tautological
curve
over
Ng,r
canonical
coordinate
arising
from
the
Köbe
uniformization
of
a
hyperbolic
curve.
Next,
we
observe
that
Serre-Tate
theory
for
ordinary
(principally
polarized)
abelian
varieties
(cf.,
e.g.,
the
case
of
ordinary
elliptic
curves
discussed
in
I.,
(C.))
may
also
be
formulated
as
arising
from
a
certain
canonical
ordinary
Frobenius
lifting.
Thus,
the
SerreTate
parameters
(respectively,
Serre-Tate
canonical
lifting)
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
canonical
multiplicative
parameters
(respectively,
canonical
lifting
to
the
Witt
vectors)
of
this
Frobenius
lifting.
That
is
to
say,
in
a
very
concrete
and
rigorous
sense,
Theorem
4
may
be
regarded
as
the
analogue
of
Serre-Tate
theory
for
hyperbolic
curves.
Nevertheless,
we
remark
that
it
is
not
the
case
that
the
condition
that
a
nilcurve
be
ordinary
(i.e.,
ord
)Fp
⊆
Ng,r
)
either
implies
or
is
implied
by
the
condition
that
its
deﬁnes
a
point
of
(Ng,r
Jacobian
be
ordinary.
Although
this
fact
may
disappoint
some
readers,
it
is
in
fact
very
natural
when
viewed
relative
to
the
general
analogy
between
ordinary
Frobenius
liftings
and
real
analytic
Kähler
metrics
discussed
above.
Indeed,
relative
to
this
analogy,
we
see
that
it
corresponds
to
the
fact
that,
when
one
equips
Mg
with
the
Weil-Petersson
metric
and
Ag
(the
moduli
stack
of
principally
polarized
abelian
varieties)
with
its
natural
metric
arising
from
the
Siegel
upper
half-plane
uniformization,
the
Torelli
map
Mg
→
Ag
is
not
isometric.
Finally,
we
remark
that
once
one
develops
these
theories
of
canonical
liftings,
one
also
gets
accompanying
canonical
(crystalline)
Galois
representations
of
the
arithmetic
ord
(and
its
Lubin-Tate
generalizations)
fundamental
group
of
the
tautological
curve
over
Ng,r
into
P
GL2
of
various
complicated
rings
with
Galois
action.
It
turns
out
that
these
Galois
representations
are
the
analogues
of
the
canonical
representation
ρX
(of
I.,
(E.)).
Moreover,
it
is
these
Galois
representations
which
exhibit
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
as
a
modular
intrinsic
Hodge
theory,
i.e.,
an
equivalence
between
(local)
algebraic
moduli
and
structures
arising
from
the
Galois
action
on
the
étale
fundamental
group
of
the
tautological
curve
–
cf.
the
discussion
of
I.,
(D.).
