Abstract.
In
the
ﬁnal
paper
of
a
series
of
papers
concerning
interuniversal
Teichmüller
theory,
Mochizuki
veriﬁed
various
numerically
non-eﬀective
versions
of
the
Vojta,
ABC,
and
Szpiro
Conjectures
over
number
ﬁelds.
In
the
present
paper,
we
obtain
various
numerically
effective
versions
of
Mochizuki’s
results.
In
order
to
obtain
these
results,
we
ﬁrst
establish
a
version
of
the
theory
of
étale
theta
functions
that
functions
properly
at
arbitrary
bad
places,
i.e.,
even
bad
places
that
divide
the
prime
“2”.
We
then
proceed
to
discuss
how
such
a
modiﬁed
version
of
the
theory
of
étale
theta
functions
aﬀects
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory.
Finally,
by
applying
our
slightly
modiﬁed
version
of
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory,
together
with
various
explicit
estimates
concerning
heights,
the
j-invariants
of
“arithmetic”
elliptic
curves,
and
the
prime
number
theorem,
we
verify
the
numerically
eﬀective
versions
of
Mochizuki’s
results
referred
to
above.
These
numerically
effective
versions
imply
eﬀective
diophantine
results
such
as
an
eﬀective
version
of
the
ABC
inequality
over
mono-complex
number
ﬁelds
[i.e.,
the
rational
number
ﬁeld
or
an
imaginary
quadratic
ﬁeld]
and
eﬀective
versions
of
conjectures
of
Szpiro.
We
also
obtain
an
explicit
estimate
concerning
“Fermat’s
Last
Theorem”
(FLT)
—
i.e.,
to
the
eﬀect
that
FLT
holds
for
prime
exponents
>
1.615
·
1014
—
which
is
suﬃcient,
in
light
of
a
numerical
result
of
Coppersmith,
to
give
an
alternative
proof
of
the
ﬁrst
case
of
FLT.
In
the
second
case
of
FLT,
if
one
combines
the
techniques
of
the
present
paper
with
a
recent
estimate
due
to
Mihăilescu
and
Rassias,
then
the
lower
bound
“1.615
·
1014
”
can
be
improved
to
“257”.
This
estimate,
combined
with
a
classical
result
of
Vandiver,
yields
an
alternative
proof
of
the
second
case
of
FLT.
In
particular,
the
results
of
the
present
paper,
combined
with
the
results
of
Vandiver,
Coppersmith,
and
Mihăilescu-Rassias,
yield
an
unconditional
new
alternative
proof
of
Fermat’s
Last
Theorem.

Introduction
In
[IUTchIV],
Mochizuki
applied
the
theory
of
[IUTchI-IV]
[cf.
also
[Alien]
for
a
detailed
survey
of
this
theory]
to
prove
the
following
result
[cf.
[IUTchIV],
Corollary
2.2,
(ii),
(iii)]:
Theorem.
Write
X
for
the
projective
line
over
Q;
D
⊆
X
for
the
divisor
consisting
of
the
three
points
“0”,
“1”,
and
“∞”;
(Mell
)Q
for
the
moduli
stack
of
elliptic
curves
over
Q.
We
shall
regard
X
as
the
“λ-line”
—
i.e.,
we
shall
regard
the
standard
coordinate
on
X
as
the
“λ”
in
the
Legendre
form
“y
2
=
x(x
−
1)(x
−
λ)”
of
the
Weierstrass
equation
deﬁning
an
elliptic
curve
—
and
hence
as
being
equipped
with
a
natural
classifying
morphism
def
UX
=
X
\
D
→
(Mell
)Q
.
Write
log(q∀(−)
)
for
the
R-valued
function
on
(Mell
)Q
(Q),
hence
also
on
UX
(Q),
obtained
by
forming
the
normalized
degree
“deg(−)”
of
the
eﬀective
arithmetic
divisor
determined
by
the
q-parameters
of
an
elliptic
curve
over
a
number
ﬁeld
at
arbitrary
nonarchimedean
places.
Let
KV
⊆
UX
(Q)
be
a
compactly
bounded
subset
that
satisﬁes
the
following
conditions:
(CBS1)
The
support
of
KV
contains
the
nonarchimedean
place
“2”.
(CBS2)
The
image
of
the
subset
“K2
⊆
UX
(Q2
)”
associated
to
KV
via
the
jinvariant
UX
→
(Mell
)Q
→
A1Q
is
a
bounded
subset
of
A1Q
(Q2
)
=
Q2
,
i.e.,
is
contained
in
a
subset
of
the
form
2Nj-inv
·
OQ2
⊆
Q2
,
where
Nj-inv
∈
Z,
and
OQ2
⊆
Q2
denotes
the
ring
of
integers
[cf.
the
condition
(∗j-inv
)
of
[IUTchIV],
Corollary
2.2,
(ii)].
Then
there
exist
·
a
positive
real
number
Hunif
which
is
independent
of
KV
and
·
positive
real
numbers
CK
and
HK
which
depend
only
on
the
choice
of
the

KV
such

property
is
satisﬁed:
Let
d
be
a
positive
integer,

and

positive
real
numbers
≤

Then
there
exists
a

Exc,d
⊆

—
where
we
denote
by
UX
(Q)≤d
⊆

(Q)
the
subset
of
Q-rational
points
deﬁned
over
a

of

depends
only
on

def
Fmod

Proposition
1.8,

deﬁned
over

ﬁeld
[i.e.,

In

achieved
by
modifying

Corollary
C.
(Application
to

Let

be
a
prime
number.
Then
there
does
not
exist

triple
(x,

of
positive

that
satisﬁes
the
Fermat

.
The
proof
of
Corollary
C
is
obtained
by
combining
•
the
slightly
modiﬁed
version
of
[IUTchI-IV]
developed
in
the
present
paper
with
•
various
estimates
[cf.
Lemmas
5.5,
5.6,
5.7]
of
an
entirely
elementary
nature.
In
fact,
the
lower
bound
of
Corollary
C
may
be
strengthened
roughly
by
a
factor
of
2
by
applying
the
results
of
[Ink1],
[Ink2]
[cf.
Remarks
5.7.1,
5.8.2],
which
are
obtained
by
means
of
techniques
of
classical
algebraic
number
theory
that
are
somewhat
more
involved
than
the
argument
applied
in
the
corresponding
portion
of
the
proof
of
Corollary
C.
The
original
estimate
of
Corollary
C
is
suﬃcient,
in
light
of
a
numerical
result
of
Coppersmith,
to
give
an
alternative
proof
[i.e.,
to
the
proof
of
[Wls]]
of
the
ﬁrst
case
of
Fermat’s
Last
Theorem
[cf.
Remark
5.8.1].
In
the
second
case
of
Fermat’s
Last
Theorem,
if
one
combines
the
techniques
of
the
present
paper
with
a
recent
estimate
due
to
Mihăilescu
and
Rassias,
then
the
lower
bound
“1.615
·
1014
”
of
Corollary
C
can
be
improved
to
“257”
[cf.
Remark
5.8.3,
(i)].
This
estimate,
combined
with
a
classical
result
of
Vandiver,
yields
an
alternative
proof
[i.e.,
to
the
proof
of
[Wls]]
of
the
second

of
Fermat’s
Last
Theorem
[cf.

the
results
of

present

combined
with
the
results
of

yield
an

new

proof
[i.e.,
to

of

Last

[The
authors
have
received
informal
reports
to
the
eﬀect
that
one
mathematician
has
obtained
some
sort
of
numerical
estimate
that
is
formally
similar
to
Corollary
C,
but
with
a
substantially
weaker
[by
many
orders
of
magnitude!]
lower
bound
for
p,
by
combining
the
techniques
of
[IUTchIV],
§1,
§2,
with
eﬀective
computations
concerning
Belyi
maps.
On
the
other
hand,
the

have
not

a

of

in

In
the
following,
we
explain
the
content
of
each

of

in

In
§1,
we
examine
various
[elementary

properties
of

of

ﬁelds.
Let

Suppose
that

x(x
−
1)(x
−
λ)
—
where
λ
∈
Q
\
{0,
1}.
For
simplicity,
assume
further
that
Q(λ)
is
mono-complex
[i.e.,
Q
or
an
imaginary
quadratic
ﬁeld
—
cf.
Deﬁnition
1.2].
Write
j(E)
∈
Q
for
the
j-invariant
of
E.
In
Corollary
1.14,
(iii),
we
verify
that
the
[logarithmic]
Weil
height
h(j(E))
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(i)]
of
j(E)
satisﬁes
the
following
property:
(H1)
Let
l
be
a
prime
number.
Suppose
that
E
admits
an
l-cyclic
subgroup
scheme,
and
that
l
is
prime
to
the
local
heights
of
E
at
each
of
its
places
of
[bad]
multiplicative
reduction
[i.e.,
the
orders
of
the
q-parameter
at
such
places
—
cf.
[GenEll],
Deﬁnition
3.3].
Then
the
nonarchimedean
portion
of
h(j(E))
is
bounded
by
an
explicit
absolute
constant
∈
R.
To
verify
(H1),
we
make
use
of
the
following
two
types
of
heights:
•
the
Faltings
height
hFal
(E)
[cf.
the
discussion
entitled
“Curves”
in
§0],
•
the
symmetrized
toric
height
hS-tor
(E)
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.7].
These
heights
hFal
(E)
and
hS-tor
(E)
may
be
related
to
h(j(E))
by
means
of
numerically
explicit
inequalities
[cf.
Propositions
1.8,
1.10,
1.12]
and
satisfy
the
following
important
properties:
(H2)
Let
E

be
an
elliptic
curve
over
F
;
φ
:
E
→
E

an
isogeny
of
degree
d.
Then
it
holds
that
hFal
(E

)
−
hFal
(E)
≤
12
log(d)
[cf.
[Falt],
Lemma
5].
(H3)
The
archimedean
portion
of
hS-tor
(E)
is
bounded
above
by
the
nonarchimedean
portion
of
hS-tor
(E)
[cf.
Proposition
1.9,
(i)].
[Here,
we
note
that
(H3)
is
an
immediate
consequence
of
the
product
formula,
together
with
the
assumption
that
the
cardinality
of
the
set
of
archimedean
places
of
the
mono-complex
number
ﬁeld
Q(λ)
is
one.]
The
property
(H1)
then
follows,
essentially
formally,
by
applying
(H2)
and
(H3),
together
with
the
numerically
explicit
inequalities
[mentioned
above],
which
allow
one
to
compare
the
diﬀerent
types
of
heights.
In
§2,
we
review

•
a
result
concerning
the
j-invariants
of
“arithmetic”
elliptic
curves
[cf.
Proposition
2.1];
•
certain
eﬀective
versions
of
the
prime
number
theorem
[cf.
Proposition
2.2].
In
§3,
we
establish
a
version
of
the
theory
of
étale
theta
functions
[cf.
[EtTh],
[IUTchII]]
that
functions
properly
at
arbitrary
bad
places,
i.e.,
even
bad
places
that
divide
the
prime
“2”.
Here,
we
note
that
the
original
definition
of
the
notion
of
an
evaluation
point
—
i.e.,
a
point
at
which
the
theta
function
is
evaluated
that
is
obtained
by
translating
a
cusp
by
a
2torsion
point
[cf.
[EtTh],
Deﬁnition
1.9;
[IUTchI],
Example
4.4,
(i)]
—
does
not
function
properly
at
places
over
2
[cf.
[IUTchIV],
Remark
1.10.6,
(ii)].
Thus,
it
is
natural
to
pose
the
following
question:
Is
it
possible
to
obtain
a
new
deﬁnition
of
evaluation
points
that
functions
properly
at
arbitrary
bad
places
by
replacing
the
“2-torsion
point”
appearing
in
the
[original]
deﬁnition
of
an
evaluation
point
by
an
“n-torsion
point”,
for
some
integer
n
>
2?
Here,
we
recall
that
the
deﬁnition
of
an
evaluation
point
obtained
by
translating
a
cusp
by
an
n-torsion
point
functions
properly
at
arbitrary
bad
places
if
the
following
two
conditions
are
satisﬁed:
(1)
The
various
ratios
of
theta
values
at
the
Galois
conjugates
of
[the
point
of
the
Tate
uniformization
of
a
Tate
curve
corresponding
to
a
primitive
2n-th
root
of
unity]
ζ2n
are
roots
of
unity
[cf.
[IUTchII],
Remark
2.5.1,
(ii)].
(2)
The
theta
value
at
ζ2n
is
a
unit
at
arbitrary
bad
places
[cf.
[IUTchIV],
Remark
1.10.6,
(ii)].
One
fundamental
observation
—
due
to
Porowski
—
that
underlies
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
is
the
following:
n
satisﬁes
the
conditions
(1),
(2)
if
and
only
if
n
=
6
[cf.
Lemma
3.1;
Proposition
3.2;
the
well-known
fact
that
1
−
ζ4
,
1
−
ζ8
are
non-units
at
places
over
2].
Following
this
observation,
in
Deﬁnition
3.3,
we
introduce
a
new
version
of
the
notion
of
an
“étale
theta
function
of
standard
type”
[cf.
[EtTh],
Deﬁnition
1.9]
obtained
by
normalizing
étale
theta
functions
at
points
arising
from
6-torsion
points
of
the
given
elliptic
curve.
In
the
remainder
of
§3,
we
then
proceed
to
discuss
how
the
adoption
of
such
“étale
theta
functions
of
μ6
-standard
type”
aﬀects
the
theory
developed
in
[EtTh].
Next,
in
§4,
we
discuss
how
the
modiﬁcations
of
§3
aﬀect
[IUTchI-III].
Roughly
speaking,
we
observe
that,
once
one
makes
suitable
minor
technical
modiﬁcations,
(∗)
the
theory
developed
in
[IUTchI-III]
remains
essentially
unaﬀected
even
if,
in
the
notation
of
[IUTchI],
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(b),
one
eliminates
8
MOCHIZUKI,
FESENKO,
HOSHI,
MINAMIDE,
AND
POROWSKI
the
assumption
“of
odd
residue
characteristic”
that
appears
in
the
discussion
of
“Vbad
mod
”.
In
§5,
we
begin
by
proving
a
“μ6
-version”
[cf.
Theorem
5.1]
of
[IUTchIV],
Theorem
1.10,
i.e.,
that
applies
the
theory
developed
in
§2,
§3,
§4.
This
allows
us
to
obtain
a
“μ6
-version”
[cf.
Corollary
5.2]
of
[IUTchIV],
Corollary
2.2,
(ii),
(iii)
[i.e.,
the
“Theorem”
reviewed
at
the
beginning
of
the
present
Introduction]
without
assuming
the
conditions
(CBS1),
(CBS2)
that
appear
in
the
statement
of
this
Theorem
concerning
the
nonarchimedean
place
“2”.
The
proof
of
Corollary
5.2
makes
essential
use
of
the
theory
of
§1,
§2
[cf.,
especially,
Corollary
1.14;
Propositions
2.1,
2.2].
In
the
case
of
mono-complex
number
ﬁelds,
we
then
derive
•
Theorem
5.3
from
Corollary
5.2
by
applying
the
product
formula,
together
with
the
essential
assumption
that
the
number
ﬁeld
under
consideration
is
mono-complex
[cf.
the
property
(H3)
discussed
above]
and
various
elementary
computations
[such
as
Proposition
1.8,
(i)];
•
Theorem
5.4
from
Theorem
5.3,
together
with
various
elementary
computations
[such
as
Proposition
1.8,
(i)].
Finally,
we
apply
•
Theorem
5.3,
together
with
various
elementary
considerations,
to
“Fermat’s
Last
Theorem”
[cf.
Corollary
5.8]
and
•
Theorem
5.4,
again
together
with
various
elementary
computations,
to
a
generalized
version
of
“Fermat’s
Last
Theorem”
[cf.
Corollary
5.9].
In
this
context,
we
note
[cf.
Remark
5.3.2]
that
it
is
quite
possible
that,
in
the
future,
other
interesting
applications
of
Theorems
5.3,
5.4
to
the
study
of
numerical
aspects
of
diophantine
equations
can
be
found.

we
consider
assertion
(i).
The
ﬁrst
equality
follows
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved.
The
second
equality
follows
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved,
together
with
the
following
[easily
veriﬁed]
fact:
For
any
s

R>0
,
it
holds
that
max{s,
s−1
}
=
max{s,
1}
·
max{s−1
,
1}.

Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
Write
d
=
[F

Then
we
compute:

v
=

h(α)
v∈V(F
)
—
where
the
ﬁnal
equality
follows
from
the
product
formula.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
Let
w
be
the
unique
element
of
V(F
)arc
.
In
light
of
the
ﬁrst
equality
of
assertion
(i),
to
verify
assertion
(iii),
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
|α|w
≥
1.
Then
we
compute:

2d

htor

where
the
second
equality
follows
from
the
product
formula.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii).
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iv).
It
follows
immediately
from
the
second
equality
of
assertion
(i)
that
to
verify
the
second
inequality
of
assertion
(iv),
it
suﬃces
to
verify
the
ﬁrst
inequality
of
assertion
(iv).
But
the
ﬁrst
inequality
follows
immediately
from
the
following
[easily
veriﬁed]
fact:
For
any
s,
t
∈
R≥0
,
it
holds
that
max{st,

max{t,

Remark
1.3.1.
It
may
appear
to
the
reader,
at
ﬁrst
glance,
that
the
notion
of
the
toric
height
of
an
element
of
a
number
ﬁeld
F
is
unnecessary
[cf.
Lemma
1.3,
(ii)].
In
fact,
however,
the
toric
height
of
an
element
α
∈
F
×
satisﬁes
the
following
important
property
[cf.
Lemma
1.3,
(iii)]:
If
F
is
mono-complex,
then
the
archimedean
portion
of
the
toric
height
of
α
is
bounded
by
the
nonarchimedean
portion
of
the
toric
height
of
α.
This
property
is
an
immediate
consequence
of
the
product
formula
[cf.
the
proof
of
Lemma
1.3,
(iii)].
We
note
that,
in
general,
the
notion
of
the
Weil
height
does
not
satisfy
this
property.
For
instance,
for
any
n
∈
Z>0
,
we
have
hnon
(n)
=
0;
htor
non
(n)
=

First,

To
verify

it
suﬃces
to
show
that
B
=
B

.
[Indeed,
it
follows
from
this
equality
that
B
=
6.
Thus,
to
verify
that
φ
is
bijective,
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
φ
is
surjective.
But
this
surjectivity
follows
immediately
from
the
equality
B
=
B

and
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved.]
The
inclusion
B

⊆

follows
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved.
Thus,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
the
inclusion
B
⊆
B

.
First,
we
observe
that
A
is
the
[disjoint]
union
of
the
following
sets:
A0∞
=
{z,
z
−1
},
A1∞
=
{1−z,

Let
δ
∈
B.
Note
that
[as
is
easily
veriﬁed]
δ
∈
/
{A0∞
,
A1∞
,
A01
}.
Thus,
we
may
write
δ
=
{a,
b}
—
where
the
pair
(a,
b)
satisﬁes
precisely
one
of
the
following
three
conditions:
(1)
a
∈
A0∞
,
b
∈
A1∞
,
(2)
a
∈
A1∞
,
b
∈
A01
,
(3)
a
∈
A01
,
b
∈
A0∞
.
On
the
other
hand,
in
each
of
these
three
cases,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
the
condition
A
=
{a,
a−1
,
b,
b−1
,
−ab,
−(ab)−1
}
implies
that
there
are
precisely
two
possibilities
for
δ,
and,
moreover,
that
these
two
possibilities
are
∈
B

,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
Assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
the
following
claim:
def
Claim
1.6A:
For
f
∈
F

,
δ
∈

write
δ(f
)
=
φ(δ)(f

Suppose
that
it
holds
that
|δ(f

=
max{|(f

∈B
Then
we
have
f
∈
Dδ
.
Let
us
verify
Claim
1.6A.
Write
δ
=
{a,
b}.
Suppose
that
f
∈
/
Dδ
.
Then
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
|a(f
)|
<
1.
Thus,
we
have
|δ(f
)|
=
|a(f
)|
·
|b(f
)|
<
|b(f
)|.
On
the
other
hand,
since
we
have
|b(f
)|
∈
{(f
)}∈B
[cf.
the
latter
portion
of
assertion
(i),
i.e.,
the
fact
that
φ
is
a
bijection],
we
obtain
a
contradiction.
Therefore,
we
conclude
that
f
∈
Dδ

This
completes
the
veriﬁcation
of
Claim
1.6A,

also
of

[cf.

First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
It
follows
from
Lemma

Thus,
to
verify
assertion
(i),
it
suﬃces
to
show
that,
for
every
v
∈
V(F
)non
lying
over

it
holds
that

,

≤
8
log

[cf.
the
equality

J(λ)v
=
||j(E)||v
].
The
ﬁrst
inequality
follows
immediately
from
the
inequality
J(λ)v
≥
2−8
·
J(λ)v
.
Next,
we
verify
the
second
inequality.
If
J(λ)v
≤
1,
then
log
max{J(λ)v
,
1}
−
log
max{2−8
·
J(λ)v

=

Thus,
we
may
assume
that
J(λ)v
>
1,
hence
that
max{J(λ)v
,
1}
=
J(λ)v
.
In
particular,
if
2−8
·
J(λ)v
>
1
(respectively,
2−8
·
J(λ)v
≤
1),
then
we
have
log
J(λ)v
−
log
max{2−8

J(λ)v

=

log(2−8

=

J(λ)v
≤

log

This
completes
the
veriﬁcation
of
the
second
inequality,
hence
also
of
assertion
(i).
Next,
we
consider

Observe

follows
from

In

with
(b)

Indeed,
this
follows
immediately
from
[Silv1],
Chapter
VII,
Proposition
5.5;
the
discussion
at
the
beginning
of
[Silv2],

are
unaﬀected
by
passing
to
ﬁnite
extensions
of
the
number
ﬁeld
F
[cf.

In
particular,
the
assumption
[cf.
the
statement
of

that
E
has
semi-stable
reduction
over

is,
in

inessential.

Write
EH

Thus,
by
applying
the

arguments
as
those
applied

we
obtain
the
following
equality:
hnon
(j(EH

=
l

hnon

[cf.

On
the
other

it
follows
from
the

that
we
have
the
following
inequality:
hFal

In
light
of
the
above
equality
and
inequality,
assertion
(i)
follows
from
Proposition

Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
Note
that,
since
λ

we
have:

Numerical
Results
In
the
present
section,
we
recall
•
a
numerical
result
concerning
the
j-invariants
of
certain
special
elliptic
curves
over
ﬁelds
of
characteristic
zero;
•
certain
eﬀective
versions
of
the
prime
number
theorem.
These
results
will
be
applied
in
§5.
Proposition
2.1.
(j-invariants
of
arithmetic
elliptic
curves)
Let
F
be
a
ﬁeld
of
characteristic
zero;
E
an
elliptic
curve
over
F
.
Suppose
that
the
hyperbolic
curve
obtained
by
removing
the
origin
from
E
is
“arithmetic”,
i.e.,
fails
to
admit
an
F
-core
[cf.
[CanLift],
Remark
2.1.1].
Then
the
j-invariant
j(E)
of
E
coincides
with
one
of
the
following:
•
488095744
=
214

•

•

Proof.
Proposition

Proposition
2.2.
(Eﬀective
versions
of
the
prime
number
theorem)
For
x
∈
R≥2
,
write
def
π(x)
=
{p
∈
Primes
|
p
≤
x};

def
log(p).
θ(x)
=
p∈Primes;
p≤x
Set
def
ηprm

Then
the
following
hold:

(i)
For
any
real
number
x
≥
ηprm
,
it
holds
that
x
π(x)
≤
1.022
·
log(x)
[cf.
[IUTchIV],
Proposition
1.6].
(ii)
For
any
real
number
x
≥
ξprm
,
it
holds
that
|θ(x)
−
x|
≤
0.00071
·

In
particular,
if
A
is
a
ﬁnite
subset
of
Primes,
and
we
write

def
log(p)
θA
=
p∈A
[where
we
take
the
sum
to
be
0
if
A
=
∅],
then
there
exists
a

p

A
such
that
p
≤
(1

(θA

ξprm
)
≤
1.00072
·
(θA
+
ξprm
)
[cf.
[IUTchIV],
Proposition
2.1,
(ii)].
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
Observe
that
log(x)
≥
log(ηprm
)
≥
1.17
47.66
≥
0.0246
.
Thus,
it
holds
that
π(x)
≤
x
1.17
log(x)−1−
log(x)
≤
x
log(x)−1.0246
[cf.
[Ax1],
Corollary
3.4;
[Ax2]].
Therefore,
we
conclude
that
x
≥
1.022
·
log(x)
x
log(x)−1.0246
≥
π(x).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
Observe
that
log(x)
≥
log(ξprm
)
≥
34.53.
Then
since
0.0242269
log(x)
≤
0.00071,
assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
[RS],

μ6
-Theory
for
[EtTh]
In
the
present
section,
we
introduce
a
slightly
modiﬁed
version
of
the
notion
of
an
étale
theta
function
of
standard
type
[cf.
Deﬁnitions
3.3,
3.5],
a
notion
which
plays
a
central
role
in
the
theory
developed
in
[EtTh].
We
then
proceed
to
discuss
how
the
adoption
of
such
a
modiﬁed
version
of
the
notion
of
an
étale
theta
function
of
standard
type
aﬀects
the
theory
developed
in
[EtTh].
We
begin
with
certain
elementary
observations
concerning
roots
of
unity
and
theta
functions.
Lemma
3.1.
(Group
actions
on
primitive
roots
of
unity)
Let
n
≥
2
be
an
even
integer;
k
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
of
characteristic
zero.
×
for
the
set
of
primitive
2n-th
roots
of
unity
in
k;
Write
μ×
2n
⊆
k
×
×
Aut(μ×
2n
)
for
the
group
of
automorphisms
of
the
set
μ2n
;
Γ−
⊆
Aut(μ2n
)
×
−
(respectively,
Γ
⊆
Aut(μ2n
))
for
the
subgroup
of
cardinality
two
generated
×
by
the
automorphism
of
μ×
2n
deﬁned
as
follows:
∀ζ
∈
μ2n
,
ζ
→
−ζ
(respectively,
ζ
→
ζ
−1
).

[Note
that
since
n
is
even,
it
follows
that
−ζ
∈
μ×
2n
.]
Then
the
following
conditions
are
equivalent:
(1)
n
∈
{2,
4,
6}.
(2)
The
action
of
Γ−
×
Γ−
on
μ×
2n
is
transitive.
Proof.
The
fact
that
(1)
⇒
(2)
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions.
Thus,
it
remains
to
verify
that
(2)
⇒
(1).
First,
we
observe
that
the
transitivity
of
the
action
of
the
group
Γ−
×
Γ−
[whose
cardinality
is
four]
on
μ×
2n
implies
×
that
(μ2n
)
≤
4.
In
light
of
this
observation,
one
veriﬁes
easily
that
n
∈
{1,
2,
3,
4,
5,
6}.
Since
n
is
even,
we
thus
conclude
that
n
∈
{2,
4,
6}.
This
completes
the
proof
of
Lemma
3.1.

Proposition
3.2.
(Theta
values
at
primitive
12-th
roots
of

In
the
notation
of
[EtTh],
Proposition
1.4:
Suppose
that
K̈
contains
a
primitive
12-th
root
of
unity
ζ12
.
Thus,
we
note
that
the
set
of

in
K̈
coincides
with
the
set
5

{ζ12

[cf.
[EtTh],

Then
the

hold:

−Θ̈(ζ12

×
.
(ii)
We
have
Θ̈(ζ12

Proof.
Assertion
(i)
follows
immediately
from
Lemma

[EtTh],

the

In

suppose
that
K
contains
a
primitive
12-th
root
of
unity.
Note
that
the
primitive
12-th
roots
of
unity
in
K
determine
precisely
four
12-torsion
points
{τ1

We

then

Remark
3.3.1.
By

Deﬁnition
4.3,
together
with
a
similar
argument
to
the
argument
applied
in
the
proof
of
[EtTh],
Theorem
1.10,
one
may
prove
a
“μ6

of
[EtTh],
Theorem
1.10,
i.e.,
the
assertion
obtained
by
replacing,
in
[EtTh],
Theorem

“odd”
−→
“arbitrary”
[cf.
Proposition

Note
that,
in

the

various

Cβ
are
somewhat
more
complicated
in
the

On
the
other
hand,
since
one
may
still
reconstruct
the
dual

grouptheoretically,
this
will
not
aﬀect
the

of
the
μ6

any
signiﬁcant
way.

Deﬁnition
4.2.
Suppose
that
we
are
in
the
situation
of
[IUTchII],
Remark
1.4.1
[cf.
also
Remark
4.2.2
below].
Write
τ
∈
X
k
(k)
for
a
torsion
point
of
order
6
whose
closure
in
any
stable
model
of
X
k
over
Ok
intersects
the
same
irreducible
component
of
the
special
ﬁber
of
the
stable
model
as
the
zero
cusp
[cf.
Remark
4.1.3].
Since
k
contains
a
primitive
12l-th
root
of
unity
[cf.
Remark
4.2.2
below],
it
follows
from
the
deﬁnition
of
an
“étale
theta
function
of
μ6
-standard
type”
[cf.
Deﬁnitions
3.3,
(ii);
3.5]
that
there
exists
a
rational
point
τ
Ÿ
∈
Ÿ
k
(k)
such
that
τ
Ÿ
→
τ
.
Write
Dτ
⊆
Πtp
Ÿ
k
for
the
decomposition
group
of
τ
Ÿ
[which
is
well-deﬁned
up

Again,
we
recall
from

3.3,

3.5,
that
an
“étale
theta
function
of
μ6

is
deﬁned

by
the

that
its

to
Dτ
be

μ6
-Theory
for
[IUTchIV]
In
the
present
section,
we
ﬁrst
give
explicit
log-volume
estimates
for
the
“μ6
-version”
of
Θ-pilot
objects
[cf.
Theorem
5.1;
Corollary
5.2].
[We
refer
to
[IUTchIV],
Theorem
1.10;
[IUTchIV],
Corollary
2.2,
(ii),
(iii),
for
the
original
“non-μ6
”
versions
of
these
results.]
Theorem
5.1
follows
directly
from
the
modiﬁed
version
of
[IUTchI-III]
discussed
in
§4
[cf.
also
§3],
together
with
certain
estimates
from
§2,
while
Corollary
5.2
is
obtained
by
combining
Theorem
5.1
with
the
theory
of
§1,
§2.
We
then
examine
Corollary
5.2
in
more
detail
in
the
case
of
mono-complex
number
ﬁelds;
this
yields
an
eﬀective
version
of
the
ABC
inequality
over
mono-complex
number
ﬁelds
[cf.
Theorem
5.3],
as
well
as
an
eﬀective
version
of
a
conjecture
of
Szpiro
over
the
ﬁeld
of
rational
numbers
[cf.
Theorem
5.4].

Thus,
in
summary,
we
conclude
from
the
estimates
made
above
that
if
we
take

to
be
the

set

equal
to

then
it
follows
from
Proposition

together
with
our
assumption
that

that,
in
the

we

[cf.

In
particular,
it
follows
from
Proposition

that
there
exists
a
prime
number
l
such
that

(P3)
if

for

then
hv
<

Next,
let
us
observe
that,
again
by
possibly
enlarging
the
ﬁnite
set
Excκ,d,
(respectively,
Excmcx

),
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that,
in
the
terminology
of
[GenEll],
Lemma
3.5,
(P4)
EF
does
not
admit
an
l-cyclic
subgroup
scheme,
and
that
it
holds
that
log(q∀(−)

}
=

)
on
Excκ,d,
(respectively,
Excmcx

).
Indeed,
the
existence
of
an
l-cyclic
subgroup
scheme
of
EF
,
together
with
the
fact
that
l
≥
1015
[cf.
(P1)],
would
imply
that
h
≤
κlog
(respectively,
h

)
[cf.
(P2);
Remark
1.10.1;
Corollary
1.14,

(respectively,

On
the
other
hand,
[by
[GenEll],
Proposition
1.4,
(iv)
[cf.
also
the
proof
of
[IUTchIV],
Corollary

(respectively,

this
implies
that
there
is
only
a
ﬁnite
number
of
possibilities
for
the
j-invariant
of
EF
.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
above
observation.
Next,
we
observe
that
(P5)
if
we
write
Vbad
mod
for
the
set
of
nonarchimedean
places
∈
Vmod
that
do
not
divide
l
and
at
which
EF
has
bad
multiplicative
reduction,
then
Vbad
mod
=
∅.
Indeed,
if
Vbad
mod

then
it
follows,
in
light
of
the
deﬁnition
of
h,
from
(P3)
that
h

log(l).
In

the

the

from

;
the
fourth
inequality
follows
from
the
estimate

Thus,
if

write

log(x)
−

·
log(2δ),
then
it

that

f

we

the
fact
that

—
a
contradiction.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
above
observation.
This
property
(P5)
implies
that
(P6)
the
image
of
the
outer
homomorphism
Gal(Q/F
)
→
GL2
(Fl
)
determined
by
the
l-torsion
points
of
EF
contains
the
subgroup
SL2
(Fl
)
⊆
GL2
(Fl
).
Indeed,
since,
by
(P5),
EF
has
bad
multiplicative
reduction
at
some
place
∈
Vbad
mod
=
∅,
(P6)
follows
formally
from
(P2),
(P4),
and
[GenEll],
Lemma
3.1,
(iii)
[cf.
the
proof
of
the
ﬁnal
portion
of
[GenEll],
Theorem

Now
it
follows
formally
from
(P1),
(P2),
(P5),
and
(P6)
that,
if
one
takes
“F
”
to
be
Q,
“F
”
to
be
the
number
ﬁeld
F
of
the
above
discussion,
“XF
”
to
be
the
once-punctured
elliptic
curve
associated
to
EF
,
“l”
to
be
the
prime
bad
number
l
of
the
above
discussion,
and
“Vbad
mod
”to
be
the
set
Vmod
of
(P5),
then
there
exist
data
“C
K

“V”,
and
“”
such
that
all
of
the
conditions
of

satisﬁed,

moreover,
that

C

V,

)
satisﬁes
the
various
conditions
in
the
statement
of
Theorem

Here,
we
note
in
passing
that
the
crucial
existence
of
data
“V”
and
“”
satisfying
the
requisite
conditions
follows,
in
essence,
as
a
consequence
of
the
fact
[i.e.,
(P6)]
that
the
Galois
action
on
l-torsion
points
contains
the
full
special
linear
group
SL2
(Fl

In
light
of
(P7),
we
may
apply
Theorem

[cf.
also
the
fact
that

to
conclude
that

This

Here,
note

that

Proof.
Assertion
(i)
follows
immediately
from
Corollary

[cf.
the
bound
on
the

of
the
function
“log(q∀(−)

“Excmcx

”;
the

of

Remark
1.10.1,
and
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved.
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
Write
w
∈
V(L)arc
for
the
unique
element
of
V(L)arc
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.2].
First,
we
claim
the
following:

log
|bc|w
+
log
max{|a|v

|c|v
}.
v∈V(L)non
Indeed,
we
compute:
b
d
·
htor
non
(
c
)
=

1
2
log
max{|
cb

v∈V(L)non
=

1
2
log
|bc|w
+
log
max{|a|v
,
|b|v
,
|c|v
}
v∈V(L)non
—
where
the
third
equality
(respectively,
the
fourth
equality)
follows
from
the
product
formula
(respectively,
the
fact
that
for
v
∈
V(L)non
,
|a|v
=
|b
+
c|v
≤
max{|b|v
,
|c|v
}).
This
completes
the
proof
of
Claim
5.3A.
Next,
we
observe
that,
to
verify
assertion
(ii),
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
||a||w
≤
||b||w
≤
||c||w
.
Then
we
observe
the
following:
Claim
5.3B:
It
holds
that
||
cb
||w
≥
12
,
hence
that
|
cb
|w
≥
(
12
)d
.
Indeed,
since
a
+
b
+
c
=
0,
we
have
||c||w
=
||a
+
b||w
≤
||a||w
+
||b||w
≤
2
·
||b||w
.
This
completes
the
proof
of
Claim
5.3B.
Now
we
claim
the
following:

It
holds
that

Indeed,
it

—
where
the
ﬁrst
equality
(respectively,
the

follows
from
Claim
5.3A
(respectively,
the
fact

Claim

The
inequality
of
Claim
5.3C
follows
immediately
from
(∗1
)
and
(∗2
).
Finally,
in
light
of
assertion
(i)
and
Claim
5.3C,
we
obtain
that
log(HL

≤

This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion

Remark
5.3.1.
The
astronomically
large
constants
in
the
inequalities
established
in
Theorem
5.3
reﬂect
the
explicit
[i.e.,
“non-conjectural”]
nature
of
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory.
Their
size
may
seem
quite
unexpected,
especially
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
classical
[“conjectural”]
literature
on
such
inequalities,
where
sometimes
it
is
even
naively
assumed
that
these
constants
may
be
taken
to
be
as
small
as
1.
Remark
5.3.2.
The
approach
to
applying
the
version
of
the
ABC
inequality
established
in
Theorem
5.3,
(ii),
to
“Fermat’s
Last
Theorem”
in
the
present
paper
[cf.
Corollary
5.8
below]
extends
to
other
diophantine
equations
[cf.
Corollary
5.9
below].
Namely,
in
view
of
the
very
large
constants
[cf.
Remark
5.3.1]
that
appear,
in
order
to
apply
such
an
inequality
to
a
concrete
diophantine
equation
of
the
form
u
+
v
=
w
with
polynomial
functions
u,
v,
w
which
involve,
respectively,
positive
integers
l,
m,
n
as
exponents,
one
needs
ﬁrst
to
establish
a
lower
bound
on
potential
solutions
of
this
equation
[cf.
Lemma
5.7
below;
the
second
to
last
display
of
the
proof
of
Corollary
5.9].
One
then
applies
a
suitable
version
of
the
ABC
inequality
to
obtain
an
upper
bound
on
l,
m,
n,
under
the
condition
that
the
diophantine
equation
admits
a
solution
of
the
desired
type
[cf.
the
portion
of
the
proof
of
Corollary
5.8
subsequent
to
the
application
of
Lemma
5.7;
the
ﬁnal
display
of
the
proof
of
Corollary
5.9].
Finally,
the
existence
of
solutions
to
the
diophantine
equation
for
l,
m,
n
satisfying
the
upper
bound
may
be
investigated
by
means
of
computer
calculations.
Remark
5.3.3.
In
the
notation
of
Theorem
5.3,
let
λ
∈
L
.
Write
Eλ
for
the
elliptic
curve
over
L
deﬁned
by
the
equation
y
2
=
x(x

(respectively,

[cf.
[Silv2],
Chapter
IV,
§10,
the
Deﬁnition
preceding

of
Eλ
over
L.
Let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
Eλ
has
semi-stable
reduction
at
every
place
v
∈
V(L)non
such
that
λ
is
integral
at
v,
and
v
does
not
divide
2.
If
v
∈
V(L)non
is
such
that
λ
is
not
integral
at
v,
then
observe
the
following:
There
exists
an
element
u
∈
L×
such
that
u
=
λw2
for
some
w
∈
L×
,
and,
moreover,
u
is
a
unit
or
a
uniformizer
at
v.
Thus,
Eλ
is
deﬁned
by
the
equation
(y

)2
=
x
(x

u)(x
−
uλ

we
write
“NL/Q

we

Then
it

that

Remark

Let

that

is
invertible
in

E
an

whose

Then,
by

with

determined
by
the

[cf.,

one
concludes
immediately
that
there
exists
λ

such
that

suppose

where

we

Now
we
apply
the

to
the

Then
we

Lemma
5.6.
(Elementary
properties
of
possible
solutions
of
the
Fermat
equation)
Let
p
≥
3
be
a
prime
number;
r,
s,
t
nonzero
coprime
integers
such
that
rp
+
sp
+
tp
=
0.
Then
the
following
hold:
(i)
Let
l
be
a
prime
number
which
divides
r
+
s,
(rp
+
sp
)(r
+
s)−1
∈
Z.
Then
it
holds
that
l
=
p.
(ii)
Suppose
that
p
does
not
divide
t.
Then
r
+
s
and
(rp
+
sp
)(r
+
s)−1
are
coprime.
In
particular,
[since
(r
+s)·(rp
+sp
)(r
+s)−1
=
(−t)p
]
there
exist
integers
u
and
ũ
such
that
r
+
s
=
up
,
(rp
+
sp
)(r
+
s)−1
=
ũp
t
=
−uũ.
(iii)
Suppose
that
p
divides
t.
Then
it
holds
that
r
+
s
∈
pZ,
(rp
+
sp
)(r
+
s)−1
∈
pZ
\
p2
Z.
In
particular,
if
we
write
t
=
pk
v,
where
k
∈
Z>0
,
v
∈
Z
\
pZ,
then
[since
(r
+
s)
·
(rp
+
sp
)(r
+
s)−1
=
(−t)p
]
there
exist
integers
w
∈
/
pZ
and
w̃
∈
/
pZ
such
that
r
+
s
=
pkp−1
wp
,
(rp
+
sp
)(r
+
s)−1
=
pw̃p
,
v
=
−ww̃
[cf.
(i)].
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
Let
l
be
a
prime
number
which
divides
r
+
s
and
(rp
+
sp
)(r
+
s)−1
.
In
particular,
it
follows
from
Lemma
5.5
that
l
divides
psp−1
.
Thus,
if
l
=
p,
then
we
conclude
that
l
divides
s,
hence
that
l
divides
r
=
(r
+
s)
−
s
—
a
contradiction.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
Suppose
that
r
+
s
and
(rp
+
sp
)(r
+
s)−1
are
not
coprime.
Then
it
follows
from
assertion
(i)
that
p
divides
r
+
s
and
(rp
+
sp
)(r
+
s)−1
,
hence
that
p
divides
rp
+
sp
=
(−t)p
—
a
contradiction.
Therefore,
we
conclude
that
r
+
s
and
(rp
+
sp
)(r
+
s)−1
are
coprime.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
We
begin
by
observing
that
(r
+
s)p
≡
rp
+
sp
≡
−tp
≡
0
(mod
p),
hence
that
r
+
s
≡
0
(mod
p).
In
particular,
it
follows
from
Lemma
5.5
that
(rp
+
sp
)(r
+
s)−1
≡
0
(mod
p).
Thus,
to
verify
assertion
(iii),
it
suﬃces
to
prove
the
following
claim:

that

Lemma
5.7.
(Elementary
estimate
for
possible
solutions
of
the
Fermat
equation)
Let
p
≥

be
a
prime
number;
x,
y,
z
coprime
positive
integers
such
that
xp
+
y
p
=
z
p
.
Then
it
holds
that
p
z
>
(p+1)
.
2
Proof.
First,
we
consider
the
case
where
p
divides
xy.
[In
particular,
p
does
not
divide
z.]
In
this
case,
to
verify
Lemma
5.7,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
p
divides
x.
[In
particular,
p
does
not
divide
y.]
Then
it
follows
by
applying
Lemma
5.6,
(ii),
ﬁrst
in
the
case
where
we
take
“(r,
s,
t)”
to
be
(x,
y,
−z),
then
in
the
case
where
we
take
“(r,
s,
t)”
to
be
(z,
−x,
−y),
that
there
exist
positive
integers
a
and
b
such
that
x
+
y
=
ap
,
z
−
x
=
bp
.
Here,
observe
that
(z
−
y)p
≡
z
p
−
y
p
≡
xp
≡
0
(mod
p),
hence
that
z
−
y
≡
0
(mod
p).
Thus,
we
obtain
that
(b
−
a)p
≡
bp
−
ap
≡
(z
−
y)
−
2x
≡
0
(mod
p),
hence
that
b
−
a
≡
0
(mod
p).
Now
we
claim
the
following:
Claim
5.7A:
It
holds
that
max{a,
b}
≥
p
+
1.
Indeed,
suppose
that
max{a,
b}
≤
p.
Then
it
follows
from
the
fact
that
b
−
a
≡
0
(mod
p)
that
a
=
b,
hence
that
z
=
2x
+
y.
In
particular,
we
conclude
that
z
p
=
(2x
+
y)p
>
xp
+
y
p
—
a
contradiction.
In
light
of
Claim
5.7A,
we
have
2z
>
z
+
y
=
ap
+
bp
>
(p
+
1)p
.
This
completes
the
proof
of
Lemma
5.7
in
the
case
where
p
divides
xy.
Next,
we
consider
the
case
where
p
does
not
divide
xyz.
Then
it
follows
by
applying
Lemma
5.6,
(ii),
ﬁrst
in
the
case
where
we
take
“(r,
s,
t)”
to
be
(x,
y,

then
in
the
case
where
we
take
“(r,

to

ﬁnally
in
the
case
where
we
take
“(r,

to
be
(z,
−y,

that
there
exist
positive
integers
a,
b,
and
c
such
that
x
+
y
=
ap
,
z
−
x
=
bp
,
z
−
y
=
cp
.
Here,
observe
that
(z
−
x
−
y)p
≡
z
p
−
xp
−
y
p
≡
0
(mod
p),
hence
that
z
−
x
−
y
≡
0
(mod

Thus,
we
obtain
that
(b

c
−
a)p
≡
bp
+
cp
−
ap
≡
2(z
−
x
−

≡

(mod

hence
that
b
+
c
−
a
≡
0
(mod

Now
we
claim
the
following:
Claim
5.7B:
It
holds
that
a
≥
p
+
1.
Indeed,
suppose
that
a
≤
p.
Observe
that
since
(2x

xp
+
y
p
=
z
p
,
(x
+
2y)p
>
xp
+

=
z
p
,
it
holds
that
x

y
>
z
−
x,
x
+
y
>
z
−
y,
hence
that
a
>
b,
a
>
c.
Thus,
we
conclude
that
−p
≤
−a
<
b
+
c
−
a
<
a
+
a
−
a
≤
p,
hence
that
b
+
c
−
a
=
0.
Next,
we
claim
that
def
Claim
5.7C:
Write
E
=
{

|

is
even}.
Then
it
holds
that
E
=
1.
Indeed,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
equality
b
+
c
−
a
=
0
that
E
≥
1.
Suppose
that
E
≥
2.
Then
it
follows
from
the
equality
b
+
c
−
a
=
0
that
a,
b,
and
c
are
even.
In
particular,
since
ap
(=
x
+
y)
divides
z
p
(=
xp
+
y
p
),
we
conclude
that
z
is
even.
On
the
other
hand,
this
implies
that
x
and
y
are
even
[cf.
the
equalities
z
−
x
=
bp
and
z
−
y
=
cp
]
—
a
contradiction.
This
completes
the
proof
of
Claim
5.7C.
Now
suppose
that
E
=
{a}
[cf.
Claim
5.7C].
Here,
note
that
it
follows
by
applying
Lemma
5.6,
(ii),
in
the
case
where
we
take
“(r,

to
be
(x,

that

Then

This
completes
the

of

In
light
of
Claim
5.7B,
we
have
2z

x
+

=
ap

(p

.
This
completes
the
proof
of
Lemma
5.7
in
the
case
where
p
does
not
divide
xyz.
Finally,
we
consider
the
case
where
p
divides
z.
[In
particular,
p
does
not
divide
xy.]
Then
it
follows
by
applying
Lemma
5.6,
(ii),
ﬁrst
in
the
case
where
we
take
“(r,
s,
t)”
to
be
(z,
−x,
−y),
then
in
the
case
where
we
take
“(r,
s,

to
be
(z,
−y,
−x),
that
there
exist
positive
integers
b
and
c
such
that
z
−
x
=
bp
,
z
−
y
=
cp
.
Moreover,
it
follows
by
applying
Lemma
5.6,
(iii),
in
the
case
where
we
take
“(r,
s,
t)”
to
be
(x,
y,
−z),
that
there
exist
positive
integers
w
∈
/
pZ
and
k,
together
with
a
negative
integer
v
∈
/
pZ,
such
that
x
+
y
=
pkp−1
wp
,
z
=
−pk
v.
Next,
observe
that
(b
+
c)p
≡
bp
+
cp
≡
2z
−
x
−
y
≡
0
(mod
p),
hence
that
b
+
c
≡
0
(mod
p).
In
particular,
it
follows
from
the
equality
bp

cp
=
pcp−1
(b

−
(b

c)2
p−2

(−1)i+1
(i

i=0
[cf.
Lemma

that

Z.
Thus,
since
we
have

v
=
2z
=
(z

+
(z

+
(x

cp

pkp−1
wp

p2
Z
[cf.
the
fact
that

we
conclude
that
k

Therefore,
we
conclude
that
2z

[cf.
the
fact
that

This
completes
the

of
Lemma

in
the
case
where
p
divides

Here,
we

Then
it
follows
from
Lemma

that
z

Now
we
apply
Theorem

“(a,

•

the

Let

Then
there

This

Corollary
5.9.
(Application
to
a
generalized
version
of
“Fermat’s
Last
Theorem”)
Let
r,
s,
t
be
nonzero
integers
every
two
of
which
are
coprime.
Write
def
S
=
{(X,
Y,
Z)

|
||XY
Z||C
≥

Let
l,
m,
n
be
positive
integers
such
that
min{l,

>
max{2.453
·
1030
,
log2
||rst||C
,
10
+

log2
(rad(rst))}.
Then
there
does
not
exist
any
triple
(x,
y,
z)
∈
S
of
coprime
[i.e.,
the
set
of
prime
numbers
which
divide
x,
y,
and
z
is
empty]
integers
that
satisﬁes
the
equation
rxl
+
sy
m
+
tz
n
=
0.
def
Proof.
Write
k
=
min{l,
m,
n}.
Suppose
that
there
exists
a
triple
(x,
y,
z)
∈
S
of
coprime
integers
such
that
rxl
+
sy
m
+
tz
n
=
0.
Then
we
claim
the
following:
Claim
5.9A:
rxl
,
sy
m
,
and
tz
n
are
coprime.
Indeed,
suppose
that
a
prime
number
p
divides
rxl
,
sy
m
,
and
tz
n
.
Let
us
consider
the
set
def
E
=
{
∈
{x,
y,
z}
|
p
divides
}.
Then,
by
applying
our
assumption
that
(x,
y,
z)
are
coprime
(respectively,
every
two
of
(r,
s,
t)
are
coprime),
we
conclude
that
E
≤
2
(respectively,
E
≥
2),
hence
that
E
=
2.
Thus,
to
verify
Claim
5.9A,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
p
divides
x
and
y.
[In
particular,
p
does
not
divide
z.]
Then
observe
that
pk
divides
rxl
and
sy
m
,
hence
also
tz
n
.
In
particular,
since
p
does
not
divide
z,
we
conclude
that
pk
divides
t.
Thus,
we
have
log2
||rst||C
≥
log2
||t||C
≥
log2
pk
≥
k
—
a
contradiction.
This
completes
the
proof
of
Claim
5.9A.
Now
we
apply
Theorem
5.4
to
the
present
situation,
by
taking
•
“(a,

to
be

}
=
24
·
max{exp(1.7

),
(rad(rstxyz))6
}.
On
the
other
hand,
since
||rst||C
·
||xyz||kC
≥
rad(rst)
·
||xyz||kC
>
24
·
(rad(rst))6
·
||xyz||6C
≥
24
·
(rad(rstxyz))6
[cf.
our
assumptions
that
k
>
4+(6−1)·log2
(rad(rst))+6
and
||xyz||C
≥
2],
we
obtain
that
2k
≤
||rst||C
·
||xyz||kC
≤
24
·
exp(1.7
·
1030
),
hence
that
k
≤
2.453
·
1030
—
a
contradiction.
This
completes
the
proof
of
Corollary
5.9.
