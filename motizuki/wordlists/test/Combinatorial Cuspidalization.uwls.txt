In
this
paper,
we
continue
our
study
of
the
pro-Σ
fundamental
groups
of
conﬁguration
spaces
associated
to
a
hyperbolic
curve,
where
Σ
is
either
the
set
of
all
prime
numbers
or
a
set
consisting
of
a
single
prime
number,
begun
in
an
earlier
paper.
Our
main
result
may
be
regarded
either
as
a
combinatorial,
partially
bijective
generalization
of
an
injectivity
theorem
due
to
Matsumoto
or
as
a
generalization
to
arbitrary
hyperbolic
curves
of
injectivity
and
bijectivity
results
for
genus
zero
curves
due
to
Nakamura
and
Harbater-Schneps.
More
precisely,
we
show
that
if
one
restricts
one’s
attention
to
outer
automorphisms
of
such
a
pro-Σ
fundamental
group
of
the
conﬁguration
space
associated
to
a(n)
aﬃne
(respectively,
proper)
hyperbolic
curve
which
are
compatible
with
certain
“ﬁber
subgroups”
[i.e.,
groups
that
arise
as
kernels
of
the
various
natural
projections
of
a
conﬁguration
space
to
lower-dimensional
conﬁguration
spaces]
as
well
as
with
certain
cuspidal
inertia
subgroups,
then,
as
one
lowers
the
dimension
of
the
conﬁguration
space
under
consideration
from
n
+
1
to
n
≥
1
(respectively,
n
≥
2),
there
is
a
natural
injection
between
the
resulting
groups
of
such
outer
automorphisms,
which
is
a
bijection
if
n
≥
4.
The
key
tool
in
the
proof
is
a
combinatorial
version
of
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
proven
in
an
earlier
paper
by
the
author,
which
we
apply
to
construct
certain
canonical
sections.

SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
Introduction
Topological
Motivation:
From
a
classical
topological
point
of
view,
one
way
to
understand
the
starting
point
of
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
is
via
the
Dehn-Nielsen-Baer
theorem
[cf.,
e.g.,
[13],
Theorem
2.9.B]
to
the
eﬀect
that
if
X
is
a
topological
surface
of
type
(g,
r)
[i.e.,
the
complement
of
r
distinct
points
in
a
compact
oriented
topological
surface
of
genus
g],
then
every
automorphism
α
of
its
[usual
topological]
fundamental
group
π1top
(X
)
that
stabilizes
the
conjugacy
classes
of
the
inertia
groups
arising
from
the
∼
r
missing
points
arises
from
a
homeomorphism
αX
:
X
→
X
.
For
n
≥
1,
let
us
write
Xn
for
the
complement
of
the
diagonals
in
the
direct
product
of
n
copies
of
X
.
Then
one
important
consequence
of
the
Dehn-NielsenBaer
theorem,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
present
paper
[cf.,
e.g.,
the
proof
of
Corollary
5.1,
(ii)],
is
that
α
extends
to
a
compatible
automorphism
of
π1top
(Xn
).
Indeed,
this
follows
immediately
from
the
fact
that
αX
induces
a
homeomorphism
∼
αXn
:
Xn
→
Xn
.
Note,
moreover,
that
such
an
argument
is
not
possible
if
one
only
knows
that
αX
is
a
homotopy
equivalence.
That
is
to
say,
although
a
homotopy
∼
equivalence
X
→
X
is,
for
instance,
if
r
=
0,
necessarily
surjective,
it
is
not
necessarily
injective.
This
possible
failure
of
injectivity
means
that
it
is
not
necessarily
the
case
that
such
a
homotopy
equivalence
X
→
X
induces
a
homotopy
equivalence
Xn
→
Xn
.
Put
another
way,
one
group-theoretic
approach
to
understanding
the
DehnNielsen-Baer
theorem
is
to
think
of
this
theorem
as
a
solution
to
the
existence
portion
of
the
following
problem:
The
Discrete
Combinatorial
Cuspidalization
Problem
(DCCP):
Does
there
exist
a
natural
functorial
way
to
reconstruct
π1top
(Xn
)
from
π1top
(X
)?
Is
such
a
reconstruction
unique?
At
a
more
philosophical
level,
since
the
key
property
of
interest
of
αX
is
its
injectivity
—
i.e.,
the
fact
that
it
separates
points
—
one
may
think
of
this
problem
as
the
problem
of
“reconstructing
the
points
of
X
,
equipped
with
their
natural
topology,
group-theoretically
from
the
group
π1top
(X
)”.
Formulated
in
this
way,
this
problem
takes
on
a
somewhat
anabelian
ﬂavor.
That
is
to
say,
one
may
think
of
it
as
a
sort
of
problem
in
“discrete
combinatorial
anabelian
geometry”.
Anabelian
Motivation:
The
author
was
also
motivated
in
the
development
of
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
by
the
following
naive
question
that
often
occurs
in
anabelian
geometry.
Let
X
be
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
a
perfect
ﬁeld
k;
U
⊆
X
a
nonempty
open
subscheme
of
X.
Write
“π1
(−)”
for
the
étale
fundamental
group
of
a
scheme.
COMBINATORIAL
CUSPIDALIZATION
3
Naive
Anabelian
Cuspidalization
Problem
(NACP):
Does
there
exist
a
natural
functorial
“group-theoretic”
way
to
reconstruct
π1
(U
)
from
π1
(X)?
Is
such
a
reconstruction
unique?
For
n
≥
1,
write
Xn
for
the
n-th
conﬁguration
space
associated
to
X
[i.e.,
the
open
subscheme
of
the
product
of
n
copies
of
X
over
k
obtained
by
removing
the
diagonals
—
cf.
[24],
Deﬁnition
2.1,
(i)].
Thus,
one
has
a
natural
projection
morphism
Xn+1
→
Xn
,
obtained
by
“forgetting
the
factor
labeled
n
+
1”.
One
may
think
of
this
morphism
Xn+1
→
Xn
as
parametrizing
a
sort
of
“universal
family
of
curves
obtained
by
removing
an
eﬀective
divisor
of
degree
n
from
X”.
Thus,
consideration
of
the
above
NACP
ultimately
leads
one
to
consider
the
following
problem.
Universal
Anabelian
Cuspidalization
Problem
(UACP):
Does
there
exist
a
natural
functorial
“group-theoretic”
way
to
reconstruct
π1
(Xn
)
from
π1
(X)?
Is
such
a
reconstruction
unique?
The
UACP
was
solved
for
proper
X
over
ﬁnite
ﬁelds
in
[21],
when
n
=
2,
and
in
[7],
when
n
≥
3.
Moreover,
when
k
is
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
[i.e.,
the
ﬁeld
of
p-adic
numbers
for
some
prime
number
p],
it
is
shown
in
[22],
Corollary
1.11,
(iii),
that
the
solution
of
the
UACP
for
n
=
3
when
X
is
proper
or
for
n
=
2
when
X
is
aﬃne
is
precisely
the
obstacle
to
verifying
the
“absolute
p-adic
version
of
Grothendieck
Conjecture”
—
i.e.,
roughly
speaking,
realizing
the
functorial
reconstruction
of
X
from
π1
(X).
Here,
we
recall
that
for
such
a
p-adic
k,
the
absolute
Galois
group
Gk
of
k
admits
automorphisms
that
do
not
arise
from
scheme
theory
[cf.
[30],
the
Closing
Remark
preceding
Theorem
12.2.7].
Thus,
the
expectation
inherent
in
this
“absolute
p-adic
version
of
Grothendieck
Conjecture”
is
that
somehow
the
property
of
being
coupled
[i.e.,
within
π1
(X)]
with
the
geometric
fundamental
group
π1
(X
×k
k)
[where
k
is
an
algebraic
closure
of
k]
has
the
property
of
rigidifying
Gk
.
This
sort
of
result
is
obtained,
for
instance,
in
[21],
Corollary
2.3,
for
X
“of
Belyi
type”.
Put
another
way,
if
one
thinks
of
the
ring
structure
of
k
—
which,
by
class
ﬁeld
theory,
may
be
thought
of
as
a
structure
on
the
various
abelianizations
of
the
open
subgroups
of
Gk
—
as
a
certain
structure
on
Gk
which
is
not
necessarily
preserved
by
automorphisms
of
Gk
[cf.
the
theory
of
[15]],
then
this
expectation
may
be
regarded
as
amounting
to
the
idea
that
this
“ring
structure
on
Gk
”
is
somehow
encoded
in
the
“gap”
that
lies
between
π1
(Xn
)
and
π1
(X).
This
is
precisely
the
idea
that
lay
behind
the
development
of
theory
of
[22],
§1.
By
comparison
to
the
NACP,
the
UACP
is
closer
to
the
DCCP
discussed
above.
In
particular,
consideration
of
the
UACP
in
this
context
ultimately
leads
one
to
the
following
question.
Suppose
further
that
Σ
is
a
set
of
prime
numbers
which
is
either
of
cardinality
one
or
equal
to
the
set
of
all
prime
numbers,
and
that
k
is
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
of
characteristic
zero.
Write
“π1Σ
(−)”
for
the
maximal
pro-Σ
quotient
of
“π1
(−)”.
Note
that
[unlike
the
case
for
more
general
k]
in
this
4
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
case,
π1Σ
(Xn
),
π1Σ
(X)
are
independent
of
the
moduli
of
X
[cf.,
e.g.,
[24],
Proposition
def
2.2,
(v)].
Thus,
in
this
context,
it
is
natural
to
write
Πn
=
π1Σ
(Xn
).
Proﬁnite
Combinatorial
Cuspidalization
Problem
(PCCP):
Does
there
exist
a
natural
functorial
“group-theoretic”
way
to
reconstruct
Πn
from
Π1
?
Is
such
a
reconstruction
unique?
Here,
it
is
important
to
note
that
although
the
PCCP
is
entirely
independent
of
k
[and
hence,
in
particular,
of
any
Galois
group
actions],
an
aﬃrmative
answer
to
PCCP
implies
an
aﬃrmative
answer
to
UACP
[and
hence
to
NACP].
That
is
to
say:
Despite
the
apparently
purely
combinatorial
nature
of
the
PCCP,
our
discussion
above
of
“ring
structures
on
Gk
”
suggests
that
there
is
quite
substantial
arithmetic
content
in
the
PCCP.
This
anabelian
approach
to
understanding
the
arithmetic
content
of
the
apparently
combinatorial
PCCP
is
interesting
in
light
of
the
point
of
view
of
research
on
the
Grothendieck-Teichmüller
group
[cf.,
e.g.,
[5]]
—
which
is
also
concerned
with
issues
similar
to
the
PCCP
[cf.
the
OPCCP
below]
and
their
relationship
to
arithmetic,
but
from
a
somewhat
diﬀerent
point
of
view
[cf.
the
discussion
of
“Canonical
Splittings
and
Cuspidalization”
below
for
more
on
this
topic].
From
a
more
concrete
point
of
view
—
motivated
by
the
goal
of
proving
“Grothendieck
Conjecture-style
results
to
the
eﬀect
that
π1
(−)
is
fully
faithful”
[cf.
Remark
4.1.4]
—
one
way
to
think
of
the
PCCP
is
as
follows.
Out-version
of
the
PCCP
(OPCCP):
Does
there
exist
a
natural
subgroup
Out∗
(Πn
)
⊆
Out(Πn
)
of
the
group
of
outer
automorphisms
of
the
proﬁnite
group
Πn
such
that
there
exists
a
natural
homomorphism
Out∗
(Πn
)
→
Out∗
(Πn−1
)
[hence,
by
composition,
a
natural
homomorphism
Out∗
(Πn
)
→
Out∗
(Π1
)]
which
is
bijective?
From
the
point
of
view
of
the
DCCP,
one
natural
approach
to
deﬁning
“Out∗
”
is
to
consider
the
condition
of
“quasi-speciality”
as
is
done
by
many
authors
[cf.
Remarks
4.1.2,
4.2.1],
i.e.,
a
condition
to
the
eﬀect
that
the
conjugacy
classes
of
certain
inertia
subgroups
are
preserved.
In
the
theory
of
the
present
paper,
we
take
a
slightly
diﬀerent,
but
related
approach.
That
is
to
say,
we
consider
the
condition
of
“FC-admissibility”,
which,
at
ﬁrst
glance,
appears
weaker
than
the
condition
of
quasi-speciality,
but
is,
in
fact,
almost
equivalent
to
the
condition
of
quasi-speciality
[cf.
Proposition
1.3,
(vii),
for
more
details].
The
apparently
weaker
nature
of
FCadmissibility
renders
FC-admissibility
easier
to
verify
and
hence
easier
to
work
with
in
the
development
of
theory.
By
adopting
this
condition
of
FC-admissibility,
we
are
able
to
show
that
a
certain
natural
homomorphism
Out∗
(Πn
)
→
Out∗
(Πn−1
)
COMBINATORIAL

as
in

is
bijective
if
n
≥

injective
if
n

3
when
X
is
arbitrary,
and

when

[cf.

Main
Result:
Our
main
result
is
the

[cf.
Corollary
1.10,
Theorem
4.1
for
more
details].

Theorem
A.
(Partial
Proﬁnite
Combinatorial
Cuspidalization)
Let
U
→S
be
a
hyperbolic
curve
of
type
(g,
r)
[cf.
§0]
over
S
=
Spec(k),
where
k
is
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
of
characteristic
zero.
Fix
a
set
of
prime
numbers
Σ
which
is
either
of
cardinality
one
or
equal
to
the
set
of
all
prime
numbers.
For
integers
n
≥
1,
write
Un
for
the
n-th
conﬁguration
space
associated
to
U
[i.e.,
the
open
subscheme
of
the
product
of
n
copies
of
U
over
k
obtained
by
removing
the
diagonals
—
cf.
[24],
Deﬁnition
2.1,

for
the

⊆
Out(Πn
)
for
the
subgroup
of
“FC-admissible”
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(ii),
for
a
detailed
definition;
Proposition
1.3,
(vii),
for
the
relationship
to
“quasi-speciality”]
outer
automorphisms
α
—
i.e.,
α
that
satisfy
certain
conditions
concerning
the
ﬁber
subgroups
of
Πn
[cf.
[24],
Deﬁnition
2.3,
(iii)]
and
the
cuspidal
inertia
groups
def
of
certain
subquotients
of
these
ﬁber
subgroups.
If
U
is
aﬃne,
then
set
n0
=
2;
if
def
U
is
proper
over
k,
then
set
n0
=
3.
Then:

The

the

obtained
by
“forgetting

is
injective
if
n
≥
n0
and
bijective
if
n
≥
5.
(ii)
By
permuting
the
various
factors
of
Un
,
one
obtains
a
natural
inclusion
Sn

of
the
symmetric
group
on
n
letters
into
Out(Πn

whose

commutes
with
OutFC

if

if

Write
Πtripod
for
the
maximal
pro-Σ
quotient
of
the
fundamental
group
of
a
tripod
[i.e.,
the
projective
line
minus
three
points]
over
k;
OutFC
(Πn
)cusp
⊆
OutFC
(Πn
)
for
the
subgroup
of
outer
automorphisms
which
determine
outer
automorphisms
of
the
quotient
Πn

Π1
[obtained
by
“forgetting
the
factors
of
Un
with
labels
>
1”]
that
induce
the
identity
permutation
of
the
set
of
conjugacy
classes
of
cuspidal
inertia
groups
of
Π1
.
Let
n
≥
n0
;
x
a
cusp
of
the
geometric
generic
ﬁber
of
the
morphism
Un−1
→
Un−2
[which
we
think
of
as
the
projection
obtained
by
def
“forgetting
the
factor
labeled
n
−
1”],
where
we
take
U0
=
Spec(k).
Then
x
determines,
up
to
Πn
-conjugacy,
an
isomorph
ΠEx
⊆
Πn
of
Πtripod
.
Furthermore,
this
Πn
-conjugacy
class
is
stabilized
by
any
α
∈
OutFC
(Πn
)cusp
;
the
commensurator
and
centralizer
of
ΠEx
in
Πn
satisfy
the
relation
CΠn
(ΠEx
)
=
ZΠn
(ΠEx
)
×
ΠEx
.
In
particular,
one
obtains
a
natural
outer
homomorphism
OutFC
(Πn
)cusp
→
OutFC
(Πtripod
)
associated
to
the
cusp
x.
Here,
we
note
in
passing
that,
by
combining
the
“group-theoreticity
of
the
isomorph
of
the
tripod
fundamental
group”
given
in
Theorem
A,
(iii),
with
the
injectivity
of
Theorem
A,
(i),
one
obtains
an
alternative
proof
of
[14],
Theorem
2.2
—
cf.
Remark
4.1.3.
In
§1,
we
discuss
various
generalities
concerning
étale
fundamental
groups
of
conﬁguration
spaces,
including
Theorem
A,
(iii)
[cf.
Corollary
1.10].
Also,
we
prove
a
certain
special
case
of
the
injectivity
of
Theorem
A,
(i),
in
the
case
of
a
tripod
[i.e.,
a
projective
line
minus
three
points]
—
cf.
Corollary
1.12,
(ii).
In
§2,
we
generalize
this
injectivity
result
to
the
case
of
degenerating
aﬃne
curves
[cf.
Corollary
2.3,
(ii)].
In
§3,
we
show
that
similar
techniques
allow
one
to
obtain
a
corresponding
surjectivity
result
[cf.
Corollary
3.3],
under
certain
conditions,
for
aﬃne
curves
with
two
moving
cusps.
In
§4,
we
combine
the
results
shown
in
§1,
§2,
§3
to
prove
the
remaining
portion
of
Theorem
A
[cf.
Theorem
4.1]
and
discuss
how
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
is
related
to
earlier
work
[cf.
Corollary
4.2;
Remarks
4.1.2,
4.1.3,
4.2.1].
Finally,
in
§5,
we
observe
that
a
somewhat
stronger
analogue
of
Theorem
4.1
can
be
shown
for
the
corresponding
discrete
[i.e.,
usual
topological]
fundamental
groups
[cf.
Corollary
5.1].
Canonical
Splittings
and
Cuspidalization:
We
continue
to
use
the
notation
of
the
discussion
of
the
PCCP.
In
some
sense,
the
fundamental
issue
involved
in
the
PCCP
is
the
issue
of
how
to
bridge
the
gap
between
Π2
and
Π1
×Π1
.
Here,
we
recall
that
there
is
a
natural
surjection
Π2

Π1
×
Π1
.
If
we
consider
ﬁbers
over
Π1
,
then
the
fundamental
issue
may
be
regarded
as
the
def
issue
of
bridging
the
gap
between
Π2/1
=
Ker(Π2

Π1
)
[where
the
surjection
is
the
surjection
obtained
by
projection
to
the
ﬁrst
factor;
thus,
the
projection
to
the
second
factor
yields
a
surjection
Π2/1

Π1
]
and
Π1
[i.e.,
relative
to
the
surjection
Π2/1

Π1
].
COMBINATORIAL
CUSPIDALIZATION

If
one
thinks
of
Π2/1
as
π1Σ
(X\{ξ})
for
some
closed
point
ξ
∈
X(k),
then
there
is
no
natural
splitting
of
the
surjection
Π2/1

Π1
.
On
the
other
hand,
suppose
that
X
is
an
aﬃne
hyperbolic
curve,
and
one
takes
“X\{ξ}”
to
be
the
pointed
stable
log
def
curve
Z
log
[over,
say,
a
log
scheme
S
log
obtained
by
equipping
S
=
Spec(k)
with
the
pro-fs
log
structure
determined
by
the
monoid
Q≥0
of
nonnegative
rational
numbers
together
with
the
zero
map
Q≥0
→
k
—
cf.
§0]
obtained
as
the
“limit”
ξ
→
x,
where
x
is
a
cusp
of
X.
Thus,
Z
consists
of
two
irreducible
components,
E
and
F
,
where
F
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
canonical
compactiﬁcation
of
X
[so
X
⊆
F
is
an
open
subscheme],
E
is
a
copy
of
the
projective
line
joined
to
F
at
a
single
node
ν,
and
the
marked
points
of
Z
consist
of
the
points
=
ν
of
F
\X
and
the
two
marked
points
=
ν
of
E.
Write
UE
⊆
E,
(X
=)
UF
⊆
F
for
the
open
subschemes
obtained
as
the
complement
of
the
nodes
and
cusps;
Y
log
for
the
pointed
stable
log
curve
obtained
from
Z
log
by
forgetting
the
marked
point
of
E
⊆
Z
determined
by
the
“limit
of
ξ”
[so
we
obtain
a
natural
map
Z
log
→
Y
log
;
X
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
complement
of
the
marked
points
of
Y
].
Thus,
by
working
with
logarithmic
fundamental
groups
[cf.
§0],
one
may
identify
the
surjection
“Π2/1

Π1
”
with
the
surjection
π1Σ
(Z
log
)

π1Σ
(Y
log
)
∼
=
π1Σ
(X).
Then
the
technical
starting
point
of
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
may
be
seen
in
the
following
observation:
The
natural
outer
homomorphism
Π1
=
π1Σ
(X)
∼
=
π1Σ
(UF
)
∼
=
π1Σ
(UF
×Z
Z
log
)
→
π1Σ
(Z
log
)
=
Π2/1
determines
a
“canonical
splitting”
of
the
surjection
π1Σ
(Z
log
)
=
Π2/1

π1Σ
(Y
log
)
∼
=
π1Σ
(X)
=
Π1
.
Put
another
way,
from
the
point
of
view
of
“semi-graphs
of
anabelioids”
determined
by
pointed
stable
curves
[cf.
the
theory
of
[20]],
this
canonical
splitting
is
the
splitting
determined
by
the
“verticial
subgroup”
(π1Σ
(UF
)
∼
=)
ΠF
⊆
π1Σ
(Z
log
)
=
Π2/1
corresponding
to
the
irreducible
component
F
⊆
Z.
From
this
point
of
view,
one
sees
immediately
that
Π2/1
is
generated
by
ΠF
and
the
verticial
subgroup
(π1Σ
(UE
)
∼
=)
ΠE
⊆
Π2/1
determined
by
E.
Thus:
The
study
of
automorphisms
of
Π2/1
that
preserve
ΠE
,
ΠF
,
are
compatible
with
the
projection
Π2/1

Π1
[which
induces
an
isomorphism
∼
ΠF
→
Π1
],
and
induce
the
identity
on
Π1
may
be
reduced
to
the
study
of
automorphisms
of
ΠE
.
Moreover,
by
the
“combinatorial
version
of
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture”
—
i.e.,
“combGC”
—
of
[20],
it
follows
that
one
suﬃcient
condition
for
the
preservation
of
[the
conjugacy
classes
of]
ΠE
,
ΠF
is
the
compatibility
of
the
automorphisms
of
Π2/1
under
consideration
with
the
outer
action
of
the
inertia
group
that
arises
from
the
degeneration
“ξ
→
x”.
On
the
other
hand,
since
this
inertia
group
is
none
other
than
the
inertia
group
of
the
cusp
x
in
Π1
,
and
the
automorphisms
of
Π2/1
under
consideration
arise
from
automorphisms
of
Π2
,
hence
are
compatible
with
the
outer
action
of
Π1
on
Π2/1
determined
by
the
natural
exact
sequence
8

→
Π2/1

Π2
→
Π1
→

it
thus
follows
that
the
automorphisms
of
Π2/1
that
we
are
interested
in
do
indeed
preserve
[the
conjugacy
classes
of]
ΠE
,
ΠF
,
hence
are
relatively
easy
to
analyze.
Thus,
in
a
word:
The
theory
of
the
present
paper
may
be
regarded
as
an
interesting
application
of
the
combGC
of
[20].
This
state
of
aﬀairs
is
notable
for
a
number
of
reasons
—
which
we
shall
discuss
below
—
but
in
particular
since
at
the
time
of
writing,
the
author
is
not
aware
of
any
other
applications
of
“Grothendieck
Conjecture-type”
results.

In
light
of
the
central
importance
of
the
“canonical
splitting
determined
by
the
combGC”
in
the
theory
of
the
present
paper,
it
is
interesting
to
compare
the
approach
of
the
present
paper
with
the
approaches
of
other
authors.
To
this
end,
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
since
the
canonical
splitting
was
originally
constructed
via
scheme
theory,
it
stands
to
reason
that
if,
instead
of
working
with
“arbitrary
automorphisms”
as
in
the
OPCCP,
one
restricts
one’s
attention
to
automorphisms
that
arise
from
scheme
theory,
then
one
does
not
need
to
apply
the
combGC.
This,
in
eﬀect,
is
the
situation
of
[14].
That
is
to
say:
The
“canonical
splitting
determined
by
the
combGC”
takes
the
place
of
—
i.e.,
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“combinatorial
substitute”
for
—
the
property
of
“arising
from
scheme
theory”.
COMBINATORIAL
CUSPIDALIZATION
9
Here,
it
is
important
to
note
that
it
is
precisely
in
situations
motivated
by
problems
in
anabelian
geometry
that
one
must
contend
with
“arbitrary
automorphisms
that
do
not
necessarily
arise
from
scheme
theory”.
As
was
discussed
above,
it
was
this
sort
of
situation
—
i.e.,
the
issue
of
studying
the
extent
to
which
the
ring
structure
of
the
base
ﬁeld
is
somehow
group-theoretically
encoded
in
the
“gap”
that
lies
between
Πn
and
Π1
—
that
motivated
the
author
to
develop
the
theory
of
the
present
paper.
Next,
we
observe
that
the
“canonical
splitting
determined
by
the
combGC”
is
not
necessary
in
the
theory
of
[5],
precisely
because
the
automorphisms
studied
in
[5]
are
assumed
to
satisfy
a
certain
symmetry
condition
[cf.
Remark
4.2.1,
(iii)].
This
symmetry
condition
is
suﬃciently
strong
to
eliminate
the
need
for
reconstructing
the
canonical
splitting
via
the
combGC.
Here,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
this
symmetry
condition
that
occurs
in
the
theory
of
the
Grothendieck-Teichmüller
group
is
motivated
by
the
goal
of
“approximating
the
absolute
Galois
group
GQ
of
Q
via
group
theory”.
On
the
other
hand,
in
situations
motivated
by
anabelian
geometry
—
for
instance,
involving
hyperbolic
curves
of
arbitrary
genus
—
such
symmetry
properties
are
typically
unavailable.
That
is
to
say,
although
both
the
point
of
view
of
the
theory
of
the
Grothendieck-Teichmüller
group,
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
absolute
anabelian
point
of
view
of
the
present
paper,
on
the
other,
have
the
common
goal
of
“unraveling
deep
arithmetic
properties
of
arithmetic
ﬁelds
[such
as
Q,
Qp
]
via
their
absolute
Galois
groups”,
these
two
points
of
view
may
be
regarded
as
going
in
opposite
directions
in
the
sense
that:
Whereas
the
former
point
of
view
starts
with
the
rational
number
ﬁeld
Q
“as
a
given”
and
has
as
its
goal
the
explicit
construction
and
documentation
of
group-theoretic
conditions
[on
Out(Π1
),
when
(g,
r)
=
(0,
3)]
that
approximate
GQ
,
the
latter
point
of
view
starts
with
the
ring
structure
of
Qp
“as
an
unknown”
and
has
as
its
goal
the
study
of
the
extent
to
which
the
“ring
structure
on
GQp
may
be
recovered
from
an
arbitrary
group-theoretic
situation
which
is
not
subject
to
any
restricting
conditions”.
Finally,
we
conclude
by
observing
that,
in
fact,
the
idea
of
“applying
anabelian
results
to
construct
canonical
splittings
that
are
of
use
in
solving
various
cuspidalization
problems”
—
i.e.,
Grothendieck

—
is
not
so
surprising,
in
light
of
the
following
earlier
developments
[all
of
which
relate
to
the
ﬁrst

the

Outer

on
Center-free
Groups:
If
1
→
H
→
E
→
J
→
1
is
an
exact
sequence
of
groups,
and
H
is
center-free,
then
E
may
be
recovered
out
from
the
induced
outer
action
of
J
on
H
as
“H

J”
—
i.e.,
as
the
pullback
via
the
resulting
homomorphism
J
→
Out(H)
of
the
natural
exact
sequence
1
→
H
→
Aut(H)
→
Out(H)
→
1
[cf.
§0].
That
is
to
say,
the
center-freeness
of
H
—
which
may
be
thought
of
as
the
most
primitive
example,
i.e.,
as
a
sort
of
“degenerate
version”,
of
the
property
of
being
“anabelian”
—
gives
rise
to
a
sort
of
“anabelian
semi-simplicity”
in
the
∼
out
form
of
the
isomorphism
E
→
H

J.
This
“anabelian
semi-simplicity”
contrasts
sharply
with
the
situation
that
occurs
when
H
fails
to
be
centerfree,
in
which
case
there
are
many
possible
isomorphism
classes
for
the
extension
E.
Perhaps
the
simplest
example
of
this
phenomenon
—
namely,
the
extensions
1

p
·
Z
→
Z
→
Z/pZ

1
and

(p
·
Z)
×
(Z/pZ)
→
Z/pZ
→
1
[where
p
is
a
prime
number]
—
suggests
strongly
that
this
phenomenon
of
“anabelian
semi-simplicity”
has
substantial
arithmetic
content
[cf.,
e.g.,
the
discussion
of
[19],
Remark
1.5.1]
—
i.e.,
it
is
as
if,
by
working
with
center-free
groups
[such
as
free
or
pro-Σ
free
groups],
one
is
aﬀorded
with
“canonical

of

Elliptic
and
Belyi
cuspidalizations
[cf.
[22],
§3]:
In
this
theory
one
constructs
cuspidalizations
of
a
hyperbolic
curve
X
by
interpreting
either
a
“multiplication
by
n”
endomorphism
of
an
elliptic
curve
or
a
Belyi
map
to
a
projective
line
minus

as,
roughly
speaking,
an
open
immersion
Y
→
X
of
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
Y

X
of
X.
This
diagram
X
←
Y
→
X
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“canonical
section”;
moreover,
this
canonical
section
is
constructed
group-theoretically
in
loc.
cit.
precisely
by
applying
the
main
[anabelian]
result
of
[16].

Cuspidalization

Fields:
Anabelian
results
such
as
the
main
result
of
[16]
have
often
been
referred
to
as
“versions
of
the
Tate
Conjecture
[concerning
abelian
varieties]
for
hyperbolic
curves”.
Over
ﬁnite
ﬁelds,
the
“Tate
Conjecture”
is
closely
related
to
the
“Riemann
hypothesis”
for
abelian
varieties
over
ﬁnite
ﬁelds,
which
is,
in
turn,
closely
related
to
various
semi-simplicity
properties
of
the
Tate
module
[cf.
the
theory
of
[25]].
Moreover,
such
semi-simplicity
properties
arising
from
the
“Riemann
hypothesis”
for
abelian
varieties
play
a
key
role
—
i.e.,
in
the
form
of
canonical
splittings
via
weights
—
in
the
construction
of
cuspidalizations
over
ﬁnite
ﬁelds
in
[21],
[7].

The
Mono-anabelian

of
[23]:
If

as
“canonical

then
the
idea
of
“applying

permeates
the
theory
of

Log
Schemes:
When
a
scheme
appears
in
a
diagram
of
log
schemes,
the
scheme
is
to
be
understood
as
a
log
scheme
equipped
with
the
trivial
log
structure.
If
X
log
is
a
log
scheme,
then
we
shall
denote
its
interior
—
i.e.,
the
largest
open
subscheme
over
which
the
log
structure
is
trivial
—
by
UX
.
Fiber
products
of
(pro-)fs
log
schemes
are
to
be
understood
as
ﬁber
products
taken
in
the
category
of
(pro-)fs
log
schemes.
The
Étale
Fundamental
Group
of
a
Log
Scheme:
Throughout
the
present
paper,
we
shall
often
consider
the
étale
fundamental
group
of
a
connected
fs
noetherian
log
scheme
[cf.
[11];
[6],
Appendix
B],
which
12

we
shall
denote
“π1
(−)”;
we
shall
denote
the
maximal
pro-Σ
quotient
of
“π1
(−)”
by
“π1Σ
(−)”.
The
theory
of
the
“π1
(−)”
of
a
connected
fs
noetherian
log
scheme
extends
immediately
to
connected
pro-fs
noetherian
log
schemes;
thus,
we
shall
apply
this
routine
extension
in
the
present
paper
without
further
mention.
Recall
that
if
X
log
is
a
log
regular,
connected
log
scheme
of
characteristic
zero
[i.e.,
there
exists
a
morphism
X
→
Spec(Q)],
then
the
log
purity
theorem
of
Fujiwara-Kato
asserts
that
there
is
a
natural
isomorphism
∼
π1
(X
log
)
→
π1
(UX
)
[cf.,
e.g.,
[11];
[17],
Theorem
B].
Let
S◦log
be
a
log
regular
log
scheme
such
that
S◦
=
Spec(R◦
),
where
R◦
is
a
complete
noetherian
local
ring
of
characteristic
zero
with
algebraically
closed
residue
ﬁeld
k◦
.
Write
K◦
for
the
quotient
ﬁeld
of
R◦
.
Let
K
be
a
maximal
algebraic
extension
of
K◦
among
those
algebraic
extensions
that
are
unramiﬁed
def
over
R◦
.
Write
R
⊆
K
for
the
integral
closure
of
R◦
in
K;
S
=
Spec(R).
Then
by
considering
the
integral
closure
of
R◦
in
the
various
ﬁnite
extensions
of
K◦
in
K,
one
obtains
a
log
structure
on
S
such
that
the
resulting
log
scheme
S
log
may
be
thought
of
as
a
pro-fs
log
scheme
corresponding
to
a
projective
system
of
log
regular
log
schemes
in
which
the
transition
morphisms
are
[by
the
log
purity
theorem]
ﬁnite
Kummer
log
étale.
Write
k
for
the
residue
ﬁeld
of
R
[so
k
∼
=
k◦
];
def
def
slog
=
Spec(k◦
)
×S◦
S◦log
;
slog
=
Spec(k)
×S
S
log
.
◦
Next,
let
X◦log
→
S◦log
be
a
proper,
log
smooth
morphism;
write
def
X
log
=
X◦log
×S◦log
S
log
→
S
log
def
log
log
X◦s
=
X◦log
×S◦log
slog
◦
→
s◦
;
def
Xslog
=
X◦log
×S◦log
slog
→
slog
for
the
result
of
base-changing
via
the
morphisms
S
log
→
S◦log
,
slog
→
S◦log
,
◦
slog
→
S◦log
.
Then
by
[33],
Théorème
2.2,
(a)
[in
the
case
where
S◦
is
a
trait];
[6],
Corollary

[for
the
general
case],
we
have
a
natural
“specialization

π1
(X◦log
).
We
shall
also
refer
to
the

π1
(X◦s

)
→
π1
(X◦log
)
→
π1
(UX◦
)
[where
the
second
isomorphism
arises
from
the
π1
(X◦s
log
purity
theorem]
as
the
“specialization
isomorphism”.
By
applying
these
specialization
isomorphisms
to
the
result
of
base-changing
X◦log
→
S◦log
to
the
various
log
regular
log
schemes
that
appear
in
the
projective
system
[discussed
above]
associated
to
the
pro-fs
log
scheme
S
log
,
we
thus
obtain
“specialization
isomorphisms”
∼
∼
π1
(Xslog
)
→
π1
(X
log
)
→
π1
(UX
)
for
X
log
→
S
log
.
Here,
we
note
that
if
K
is
any
algebraic
closure
of
K,
and
the
restriction
of
X◦log

S◦log
to
US◦
is
a

then
we

∼

[cf.
[24],
Proposition

We

as
the

Curves:
We

use
the
terms
hyperbolic
curve,
cusp,
stable
log
curve,
and
smooth
log
curve
as
they
are
deﬁned
in
[20],
§0.
Thus,
the
interior
of
a
smooth
log
curve
over
a
scheme
determines
a
family
of
hyperbolic
curves
over
the
scheme.
A
smooth

curve
or

of
type
(0,

will
be
referred
to
as
a

We

use
the

space
and
n-th
log
conﬁguration
space
as
they
are
deﬁned
in
[24],
Deﬁnition
2.1,
(i).
If
g,
r
are
positive
integers
such
that
log
2g
−
2
+
r
>
0,
then
we
shall
write
Mg,r
for
the

of

of

over
[the
ring
of

Z
equipped
with

determined
by
the

at

Here,
we
assume
the

of
the

to
be
ordered.
The
interior
of
Mg,r
will
be
denoted

Section

Generalities

In
the
present
§1,
we
begin
by
discussing
various
generalities
concerning
the
various
log
conﬁguration
spaces
associated
to
a
hyperbolic

This
discussion
leads
naturally
to
a
proof
of
a
certain
special
case
[cf.
Corollary
1.12,

of
our
main
result
[cf.
Theorem

for

[cf.

Let

Fix
a
set
of
prime
numbers
Σ
which
is
either
of
cardinality
one
or
equal
to
the
set
of
all

Deﬁnition

Let

Write

for
the

of
the
log

[cf.
§0;
the
discussion
preceding
[24],
Deﬁnition
2.1,

Thus,

Also,
for

integers
a

we

so
we
obtain
a
natural

Thus,
if

a

then
we

The

Since

it

possible
to

the

an

cf.

On

examples

it

Thus,
in
general,
neither

properties

implies
the

Remark
1.1.5.
Let
α

(Πn

.
Then
observe
that
α
necessarily
induces
the
identity
permutation
on
the
set
of
conjugacy
classes
of
cuspidal
inertia
groups
of
every
standard-adjacent
subquotient
of
Πn
[i.e.,
not
just
Π1
].
Indeed,
by
applying
the
interpretation
of
the
various
Πb/a
as
“Πb−a
’s”
for
appropriate
“X
log
”
[cf.
[24],
Proposition
2.4,
(i)],
we
reduce
immediately
to
the
case
n
=
2.
But
then
the
cuspidal
inertia
group
⊆
Π2/1
associated
to
the
unique
new
cusp
that
appears
may
be
characterized
by
the
property
that
it
is
contained
in
Ξ2
[which,
in
light
of
the
F-admissibility
of
α,
is
clearly
preserved
by
α].
Proposition
1.2.
(First
Properties
of
Admissibility)
In
the
notation
of
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(ii),
let
α
∈
Aut(Πn
).
Then:
(i)
Suppose
that
α(Ξn
)
=
Ξn
.
Then
there
exists
a
permutation
automorphism
σ
∈
Aut(Πn
)
such
that
α
◦
σ
is
F-admissible.
In
particular,
if
α
is
C-admissible,
then
it
follows
that
α
is
FC-admissible.
(ii)
Suppose
that
α
∈
AutFC
(Πn
).
Let
ρ
:
Πn

Πm
be
the
quotient
of
Πn
by
a
ﬁber
subgroup
of
co-length
m
≤
n
[cf.
[24],
Deﬁnition
2.3,
(iii)].
Then
α
induces,
relative
to
ρ,
an
element
αρ
∈
AutFC
(Πm
).
If,
moreover,
α
∈
AutDFC
(Πn
)
(respectively,
α
∈
AutIFC
(Πn
)),
then
αρ
∈
AutDFC
(Πm
)
(respectively,
αρ
∈
AutIFC
(Πm
)).
(iii)
Suppose
that
α
∈
AutFC
(Πn
).
Then
there
exist
β
∈
AutDFC
(Πn
),
ι
∈
Inn(Πn
)
such
that
α
=
β
◦
ι.
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
Since
α(Ξn
)
=
Ξn
,
it
follows
that
α
induces
an
automorphism
of
the
quotient
Πn

Π1
×.
.
.×Π1
[i.e.,
onto
the
direct
product
of
n
copies
of
Π1
]
determined
by
the
various
ﬁber
subgroups
of
co-length
1.
Moreover,
by
[24],
Corollary
3.4,
this
automorphism
of
Π1
×
.
.
.
×
Π1
is
necessarily
compatible
with
the
direct
product
decomposition
of
this
group,
up
to
some
permutation
of
the
factors.
Thus,
by
replacing
α
by
α
◦
σ
for
some
permutation
automorphism
σ,
we
may
assume
that
the
induced
automorphism
of
Π1
×
.
.
.
×
Π1
stabilizes
each
of
the
direct
factors.
Now
let
us
observe
that
this
stabilization
of
the
direct
factors
is
suﬃcient
to
imply
that
α(H)
=
H
for
any
ﬁber
subgroup
H
⊆
Πn
.
Indeed,
without
loss
of
generality,
we
may
assume
[by
possibly
re-ordering
the
indices]
that
H
=
Ka
for
some
Ka
as
in
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(i).
By
applying
the
same
argument
to
α−1
,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
α(Ka
)
⊆
Ka
.
Thus,
let
us
suppose
that
α(Ka
)
⊆
Kb
for
some
b
<
a,
but
α(Ka
)
⊆
Kb+1
.
On
the
other
hand,
the
image
of
α(Ka
)
in
18
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
Πb+1/b
=
Kb
/Kb+1
is
normal,
closed,
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated,
and
of
inﬁnite
index
[since,
in
light
of
the
stabilization
of
direct
factors
observed
above,
this
image
maps
to
{1}
via
the
natural
projection
Kb
/Kb+1

Π1
].
Thus,
by
[24],
Theorem
1.5
—
i.e.,
essentially
the
theorem
of
Lubotzky-Melnikov-van
den
Dries
—
we
conclude
that
this
image
is
trivial,
a
contradiction.
This
contradiction
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Assertion
(ii)
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions.
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
For
positive
integers
m
≤
n,
write
φm
:
Πn

Π1
for
the
quotient
of
Πn
by
the
ﬁber
subgroup
whose
co-proﬁle
is
equal
to
{m}
[cf.
[24],
Deﬁnition
2.3,
(iii)].
def
Thus,
by
assertion
(ii),
we
obtain
various
αm
=
αφm
∈
Aut(Π1
),
with
images
[αm
]
∈
Out(Π1
).
Then
let
us
observe
that
to
complete
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii),
it
suﬃces
to
verify
the
following
claim:
[αm
]
∈
Out(Π1
)
is
independent
of
m.
To
verify
this
claim,
we
reason
as
follows:
By
applying
assertion
(ii)
to
the
surjection
ρ
:
Πn

Π2
for
which
Ker(ρ)
has
co-proﬁle
{1,
m}
for
m
=
1,
we
reduce
immediately
to
the
case
where
n
=
2.
Then
observe
that
it
follows
immediately
from
the
“uniqueness
of
a
cusp
associated
to
a
given
cuspidal
inertia
group”
[cf.
[20],
Proposition
1.2,
(i)]
that
the
decomposition
groups
⊆
Π2
[all
of
which
are
Π2
-conjugate
to
one
another]
associated
to
the
diagonal
divisor
in
X2
may
be
reconstructed
as
the
normalizers
of
the
various
cuspidal
inertia
groups
of
Π2/1
that
lie
in
Ξ2
.
In
particular,
it
follows
immediately
that
α
induces
a
bijection
of
the
collection
of
decomposition
groups
of
Π2
associated
to
the
diagonal
divisor
in
X2
[all
of
which
are
Π2
-conjugate
to
one
another].
Thus,
the
automorphism
of
Π1
×
Π1
induced
by
α
relative
to
the
quotient
(φ1
,
φ2
)
:
Π2

Π1
×
Π1
maps
the
diagonal
Π1
⊆
Π1
×
Π1
[which
is
the
image
of
a
decomposition
group
associated
to
the
diagonal
divisor
in
X2
]
to
some
(Π1
×
Π1
)-conjugate
of
the
diagonal
Π1
⊆
Π1
×
Π1
.
But
then
it
follows
formally
that
[α1
]
=
[α2
].
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
claim,
and
hence
of
assertion
(iii).
Proposition
1.3.
(Decomposition
and
Inertia
Groups)
Let
n
≥
1.
Write
Dn
for
the
set

joined
by
a

One

which
we

SHINICHI

Proof.
We
apply
induction
on
n.
Thus,
in
the
following,
we
may
assume
that
Proposition
1.3
has
been
veriﬁed
for
“smaller
n”
than
the
“n
under
consideration”.
Assertion
(i)
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions.
Assertion
(ii)
follows
from
the
log
log
well-known
geometry
of
Xnlog
,
Xn−1
,
by
thinking
of
Xn−1
as
a
certain
“moduli
space
of
pointed
stable
curves”
and
ψ
log
as
the
“tautological
pointed
stable
curve
over
this
moduli
space”.
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
First,
we
observe
that
by
applying
the
specialization
isomorphisms
[cf.
§0]
associated
to
the
restriction
log
to
the
completion
of
Xn−1
along
the
generic
point
of
,
of
ψ
log
:
Xnlog
→
Xn−1
we
conclude
that
the
pointed
stable
curve
structure
on
(Xn
)
[cf.
assertion
(ii)]
determines
a
“semi-graph
of
anabelioids
of
pro-Σ
PSC-type”
as
discussed
in
[20],
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(i)
[cf.
also
the
discussion
of
[18],
Appendix]
whose
associated
“PSCfundamental
group”
may
be
identiﬁed
with
Πn/n−1
.
From
this
point
of
view,
Πζ
forms
a
“verticial
subgroup”
[cf.
[20],
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(ii)];
Πν
forms
a(n)
[nodal]
“edge-like
subgroup”
[cf.
[20],
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(ii)].
In
particular,
Πζ
is
center-free
[cf.,
e.g.,
[20],
Remark
1.1.3].
Now
(a),
(b)
follow
from
the
description
of
δF
,
δE
given
in
assertion
(ii);
(c)
follows
from
[20],
Proposition
1.2,
(ii).
To
verify
(d),
observe
that
by
general
considerations,
the
inertia
group
Iζ
is
isomorphic
to
some
quotient

Σ
[cf.

Σ
;
on
the
other
hand,
by
the
induction
hypothesis,
I
is
isomorphic
to
Z
of
Z
assertion
(v)
for
“n−1”];
thus,
since
(Xn
)
is
reduced
at
its
two
generic
points
[which

Σ
)
Iζ
→
I
(∼

Σ
)
is
correspond
to
δF
,
δE
],
it
follows
that
the
homomorphism
(Z
=Z
surjective,
hence
an
isomorphism.
Now
(e)
follows
immediately
from
(d);
(f)
follows
from
(c),
(d),
and
(e);
since,
as
observed
above,
I
is
abelian,
(g)
follows
from
(d),
(e),
(f),
and
the
fact
that
Πζ
is
center-free.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii).
Next,
we
observe
that
since
α
induces
a
bijection
of
the
collection
of
cuspidal
inertia
groups
⊆
Πn/n−1
[a
fact
which
renders
it
possible
to
apply
the
theory
of
[20]
in
the
noncuspidal
case],
assertion
(iv)
for
Πθ
,
Πθ
follows
immediately
from
[20],
Corollary
2.7,
(iii);
assertion
(iv)
for
“DIθ
”,
“DIθ
”
or
“Iθ
”,
“Iθ
”
follows
from
assertion
(iv)
for
Πθ
,
Πθ
by
applying
(f),
(g)
of
assertion
(iii).
Next,
we
consider
assertions
(v),
(vi).
When
n
=
1,
assertions
(v),
(vi)
follow,
respectively,
from
the
“uniqueness
of
a
cusp
associated
to
a
given
cuspidal
inertia
group”
[cf.
[20],
Proposition
1.2,
(i)],
and
the
fact
that
α
∈
OutFC
(Πn
)cusp
.
Thus,
we
may
assume
that
n
≥
2.
The
fact
that
α
stabilizes
the
conjugacy
classes
of
the
Iδ
for
δ
∈
Dnhor
follows
immediately
from
the
fact
that
α
is
C-admissible
[cf.
also
Remark
1.1.5].
Now
let
ζ
∈
Dnver
,

∈
Dn−1
be
as
in
assertion
(iii).
By
the
induction

Σ
and
determines
a
Πn−1
-conjugacy
class
that
is
hypothesis,
I
is
isomorphic
to
Z
distinct
from
the
Πn−1
-conjugacy
classes
of
the
“I(−)
”
of
elements
of
Dn−1
that
are
=
;
moreover,
the
outer
automorphism
∈
OutFC
(Πn−1
)cusp
induced
by
α
via
ρψ
stabilizes
the
conjugacy
class
of
I
.
In
particular,
by
(d)
of
assertion
(iii),
it
follows

Σ
,
hence
that
the
“I(−)
”
of
elements
of
D
hor
may
be
that
Iζ
is
isomorphic
to
Z
n
distinguished
from
those
of
Dnver
by
the
property
that
they
lie
in
Πn/n−1
=
Ker(ρψ
)
and
from
one
another
by
[20],
Proposition
1.2,
(i).
Thus,
to
complete
the
proof
of
assertions
(v),
(vi),
it
suﬃces
to
verify
assertions
(v),
(vi)
with
“Dn
”
replaced
by
“the
subset
{δF
,
δE
}
⊆
Dn
”.
But
then
assertion
(vi)
follows
from
the
resp’d
case
of
assertion
(iv);
moreover,
by
the
non-resp’d
case
of
assertion
(iv),
if
IδE
,
IδF
are
Πn
-conjugate,
then
they
are
Πn/n−1
-conjugate.
COMBINATORIAL
CUSPIDALIZATION
21
Thus,
to
complete
the
proof
of
assertion
(v),
it
suﬃces
to
derive
a
contradiction
under
the
assumption
that
IδE
=
γ
·
IδF
·
γ
−1
,
where
γ
∈
Πn/n−1
.
Note
that
by
(e)
of
assertion
(iii),
this
assumption
implies
that
IδE
commutes
with
ΠδE
,
γ
·
ΠδF
·
γ
−1
.
Next,
observe
that
by
projecting
to
the
various
maximal
pro-l
quotients
for
some
l
∈
Σ,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
Σ
=
{l}.
Then
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
the
images
of
ΠδE
,
ΠδF
in
the
abelianization
Πab
n/n−1
of
Πn/n−1
ab
generate
Πn/n−1
,
hence
[since
Πn/n−1
is
a
pro-l
group
—
cf.,
e.g.,
[31],
Proposition
7.7.2]
that
Πn/n−1
is
generated
by
ΠδE
and
any
single
Πn/n−1
-conjugate
of
ΠδF
.
Thus,
in
summary,
we
conclude
that
IδE
commutes
with
Πn/n−1
,
i.e.,
that
the
outer
action
of
I
on
Πn/n−1
is
trivial.
On
the
other
hand,
since
the
nodal
curve
(Xn
)
is
not
smooth,
we
obtain
a
contradiction,
for
instance,
from
[20],
Proposition
2.6.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(v).
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(vii).
The
fact
that
OutFC
(Πn
)cusp
⊆
OutQS
(Πn
)
follows
immediately
from
assertion
(vi).
Next,
let
us
observe
that
by
applying
“Zariski-Nagata
purity”
[i.e.,
the
classical
non-logarithmic
version
of
the
“log
purity
theorem”
discussed
in
§0]
to
the
product
of
n
copies
of
UX
over
k,
it
follows
that
the
subgroup
Ξn
⊆
Πn
is
topologically
normally
generated
by
the
Iδ
,
for
the
δ
∈
Dn∗
that
arise
as
strict
transforms
of
the
various
diagonals
in
Pn
.
Thus,
the
fact
that
OutQS
(Πn
)
⊆
OutFC
(Πn
)cusp
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
“OutQS
(−)”
and
Proposition
1.2,
(i).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(vii).
Remark
1.3.1.
The
theory
of
inertia
and
decomposition
groups
such
as
those
discussed
in
Proposition
1.3
is
developed
in
greater
detail
in

§1.
For

Let

Observe
that

maps

via

Fx

are
joined
at
a

[cf.

Let

to

as
the

and
its

the
major

together
with
the

determine

—
which
we
shall
refer
to,
respectively,
as

Thus,
[cf.
Proposition

the
morphism
p2
:
Π2

determines
an
isomorphism

p2
maps

Proof.
Assertion
(i)
follows
from
[20],
Proposition
1.2,
(ii)
[cf.
Proposition
1.3,
(iii),
(c)].
Assertion
(ii)
follows
from
the
fact
that
“every
nodal
edge-like
subgroup
is
contained
in
precisely
two
verticial
subgroups”
[cf.
[20],
Proposition
1.5,
(i)].
Assertion
(iii)
may
be
thought
of
as
a
consequence
of
the
“van
Kampen
Theorem”
in
elementary
algebraic
topology.
At
a
more
combinatorial
level,
one
may
reason
as
follows:
It
follows
immediately
from
the
simple
structure
of
the
dual
graph
of
the
pointed
stable
curves
considered
in
Deﬁnition
1.4
that
there
is
a
natural
equivalence
of
categories
[arising
from
the

in
the

of

between

from

Remark
1.5.1.
The
technique
of
“van
Kampen-style
gluing”
of
fundamental
groups
that
appears
in
Proposition
1.5,
(iii),
will
play
an
important
role
in
the
present
paper.
Similar
methods
involving
isomorphs
of
the
fundamental
group
of
a
tripod
[cf.
Corollary
1.10,
(iii),
below;
Theorem
A,
(iii),
of
the
Introduction]
may
be
seen
in
the
arguments
of
[27],
[28].
Proposition

(Inertia

In
the

of
the

Deﬁnition

write

Π1\2
=
Ker(p2
:
Π2

)
[cf.
Π2/1

Thus,
each
cusp
of
the
family
of
hyperbolic
curves
pr2
|UX2
:

gives
rise
to
a

Then:

Let

Then:
(a)
the

Let

think
of
x,
Fx
as
elements
of

[cf.

Then:
(a)
the

is
equal
to
the
closure
in

Proof.
The
content
of
(a),
(b)
of
assertion
(i)
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions
involved;
(c)
follows
immediately
from
(b),
together
with
the
fact
that

is
24
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
commensurably
terminal
in
either
Π2/1
or
Π1\2
[cf.
[20],
Proposition
1.2,
(i)].
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
First,
let
us
observe
that
(a),
(b)
are
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions;
(c)
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions
and
(a);
(d)
follows
immediately
from
(b)
[cf.
Proposition
1.3,
(iii)].
To
verify
(e),
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
log
log
that
it
follows
immediately
from
the
geometry
of
the
morphism
prlog
2
:
X2
→
X1
that
p2
(IFx
)
=
{1};
thus,
(e)
follows
[in
light
of
(d)]
from
Proposition
1.3,
(iii),
(a),
(e).
Finally,
since
Ix
is
commensurably
terminal
in
Π1
[cf.
[20],
Proposition
1.2,
(ii)],
(f)
follows
immediately
from
(d)
and
Proposition
1.3,
(iii),
(d),
(e),
(f).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
It
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
ασ
∈
Aut(Π2
)
is
F-admissible.
Moreover,
it
follows
immediately
from
Proposition
1.2,
(iii),
together
with
the
C-admissibility
of
α,
that
ασ
induces
a
bijection
of
the
collection
of
cuspidal
inertial
groups
of
the
quotient
p1
:
Π2

Π1
.
Thus,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
ασ
induces
a
bijection
of
the
collection
of
cuspidal
inertial
groups
of
Π2/1
,
i.e.,
that
α
induces
a
bijection
of
the
collection
of
cuspidal
inertial
groups
of
Π1\2
.
But
in
light
of
assertions
(i)
and
(ii),
(c),
this
follows
immediately
from
the
FC-admissibility
of
α
and
Proposition
1.3,
(vi).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii).
Proposition
1.7.
(Inertia
and
Decomposition
Groups
of
Minor
Cuspidal
Components)
In
the
notation
of
Proposition
1.6,
suppose
further
that
x
∈
X1
(k)
=
X(k)
is
a
cusp
of
X
log
.
Let
us
think
of
x,
Ex
as
elements
of
D1
,

D2ver
,
respectively
[cf.
Proposition
1.3,
(i)].
Then:
(a)
DEx
=
DIEx
;
(b)
Π1\2
=
{1};
(c)
DEx
=
CΠ2
(DEx
);
(d)
for
any
open
subgroup
J
⊆
ΠEx
,
IEx
ZΠ2
(J)
=
IEx
;
(e)
DEx
=
CΠ2
(ΠEx
).
Proof.
First,
we
observe
that
the
equality
of
(a)
(respectively,
(c))
follows
by
a
similar
argument
to
the
argument
applied
to
prove
Proposition
1.6,
(ii),
(d)
(respectively,
1.6,
(ii),
(f));
(b)
follows
immediately
from
the
geometric
fact
that
the
inverse
image
via
pr2
:
X2
→
X1
of
the
closed
point
x
contains
the
divisor
Ex
with
multiplicity
one.
Next,
let
us
consider
(d).
First,
let
us
observe
that,
in
the
notation
of
Proposition
1.6,
(i),
the
diagonal
divisor
δ
intersects
Ex
transversely;
in
particular,
[forappropriate
choices
of
conjugates]
we
have
Iδ
⊆
ΠEx
.
Thus,
ZΠ2
(J)
⊆
ZΠ2
(J
Iδ
)
⊆
CΠ2
(Iδ
)
=
Dδ
[cf.
Proposition
1.6,
(i),
(c)].
On
the
other
hand,
note
that
p2
(ΠEx
)
is
a
cuspidal
inertia
group
—
i.e.,
“Ix
”
—
of
Π1
associated
to
x
[cf.
Proposition
1.3,
(iii),
(b)],
hence
commensurably
terminal
in
Π1
[cf.
[20],
Proposition
1.2,
(ii)].
Thus,
the
inclusion
ZΠ2
(J
)
⊆
Dδ
implies
[for
appropriate
choices
of
conjugates]
that
p1
(ZΠ2
(J
))
=
p2
(ZΠ2
(J
))
⊆
Ix
,
so
the
desired
equality
ZΠ2
(J)
=
IEx
follows
immediately
from
Proposition
1.3,
(iii),
(e),
(f),
together
with
the
fact
that
ΠEx
is
slim
[cf.
Remark
1.1.1].
This
completes
the
proof
of
(d).
Now
it
follows
immediately
from
(d)
that
CΠ2
(ΠEx
)
⊆
NΠ2
(IEx
).

(Outer

Verticial
Subgroups)
Suppose
that
n
≥
2.
Then
the
subquotient
Πn−1/n−2
of
Πn
may
be
regarded
[cf.
[24],
Proposition
2.4,
(i)]
as
the
pro-Σ
fundamental
group
—
i.e.,
“Π1
”
—
of
the
geometric
log
log
→
Xn−2
[which
we
think
of
as
the
projecgeneric
ﬁber
Z
log
of
the
morphism
Xn−1
tion
obtained
by
“forgetting
the
factor
labeled
n
−
1”];
the
subquotient
Πn/n−2
may
then
be
thought
of
[cf.
[24],
Proposition
2.4,
(i)]
as
the
pro-Σ
fundamental
group
of
2-nd
log
conﬁguration
space
—
i.e.,
“Π2
”
—
associated
to
Z
log
.
In
particular,
any
cusp
x
of
Z
log
determines,
up
to
Πn/n−2
-conjugacy,
a
minor
verticial
subgroup
—
i.e.,
an
isomorph
of
Πtripod
—
ΠEx
⊆
Πn/n−1
.
Then:
(i)
Any
α
∈
AutFC
(Πn
)cusp
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(v)]
stabilizes
the
Πn/n−2
conjugacy
class
of
ΠEx
.
(ii)
The
commensurator
and
centralizer
of
ΠEx
in
Πn
satisfy
the
relation
CΠn
(ΠEx
)
=
ZΠn
(ΠEx
)
×
ΠEx
.
In
particular,
for
any
open
subgroup
J
⊆
ΠEx
,
we
have
ZΠn
(J
)
=
ZΠn
(ΠEx
).
(iii)
By
applying
(i),
(ii),
one
obtains
a
natural
homomorphism
OutFC
(Πn
)cusp
→
OutFC
(ΠEx
)
and
hence
a
natural
outer
homomorphism
OutFC
(Πn
)cusp
→
OutFC
(Πtripod
),
associated
to
the
cusp
x
of
Z
log
.
Proof.
In
light
of
the
superscript
“cusp”
and
the
FC-admissibility
of
α
[cf.
Remark
1.1.5],
assertion
(i)
follows
immediately
from
the
resp’d
portion
of
Proposition
1.3,
COMBINATORIAL
CUSPIDALIZATION
27
(iv).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
First,
let
us
recall
that
ΠEx
is
commensurably
terminal
in
Πn/n−1
[cf.
Proposition
1.5,
(i)].
On
the
other
hand,
it
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
CΠn
(ΠEx
)
⊆
NΠn
(CΠn/n−1
(ΠEx
)).
Thus,
we
conclude
that
CΠn
(ΠEx
)
=
NΠn
(ΠEx
).
In
particular,
to
complete
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii),
it
suﬃces
[since
ΠEx
is
slim
—
cf.
Remark
1.1.1]
to
verify
that
(*)
the
natural
outer
action
of
NΠn
(ΠEx
)
on
ΠEx
is
trivial.
Now
let
j
∈
{1,
.
.
.
,
n
−
1}
be
the
smallest
element
m
∈
{1,
.
.
.
,
n
−
1}
such
that
x
log
log
→
Xm−1
corresponds
to
a
cusp
of
the
geometric
generic
ﬁber
of
the
morphism
Xm
[which
we
think
of
as
the
projection
obtained
by
“forgetting
the
factor
labeled
m”].
def
[Here,
we
write
X0log
=
Spec(k).]
Now
if
j
=
1,
then
by
applying
the
projection
Πn

Π2
determined
by
the
factors
labeled
1,
n,
we
conclude
that
(*)
follows
from
Propositions
1.3,
(iii),
(e);
1.7,
(a),
(e).
In
a
similar
vein,
if
j
≥
2,
then
by
applying
the
projection
Πn

Π3
determined
by
the
factors
labeled
j
−
1,
j,
n,
we
conclude
that
(*)
follows
from
Proposition
1.9,
(i),
(b);
1.9,
(iii).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Finally,
we
observe
that
assertion
(iii)
follows
immediately
from
assertions
(i),
∼
(ii),
by
choosing
some
isomorphism
ΠEx
→
Πtripod
[which
is
determined
only
up
to
composition
with
an
element
of
AutFC
(Πtripod
)]
that
is
compatible
with
the
cuspidal
inertia
groups.
That
is
to
say,
if
α
∈
AutFC
(Πn
)cusp
,
then
by
assertion
(i),
α0
(α(ΠEx
))
=
ΠEx
for
some
Πn
-inner
automorphism
α0
of
Πn
.
Since
α0
is
uniquely
determined
up
to
composition
with
an
element
of
NΠn
(ΠEx
),
it
follows
from
assertion
(ii)
that
the
outer
automorphism
α1
∈
OutFC
(ΠEx
)
determined
by
α0
◦
α
is
uniquely
determined
by
α.
Moreover,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
the
assignment
α
→
α1
determines
a
homomorphism
OutFC
(Πn
)cusp
→
OutFC
(ΠEx
),
hence
an
outer
homomorphism
OutFC
(Πn
)cusp
→
OutFC
(Πtripod
),
as
desired.

that

(iii)
We
have:
OutFCP
(Π2

=
OutFC
(Π2

Proof.
First,
we
observe
that
assertion
(ii)
follows
formally
from
assertion
(i)
and
Proposition
1.2,
(iii).
Next,
we
observe
that
assertion
(iii)
follows
formally
from
assertion
(ii)
and
Propositions
1.2,
(iii);
1.6,
(iii).
Thus,
to
complete
the
proof
of
Corollary
1.12,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
assertion
(i).
To
this
end,
let
α
∈
AutIFC
(Π2
).
Let
us
assign
the
cusps
of
X
log
the
labels
a,
b,
c.
Note
that
the
labels
of
the
cusps
of
X
log
induce
labels
“a”,
“b”,
“c”
for
three
of
the
cusps
of
the
geometric
generic
ﬁber
of
the
morphism
UX2
→
UX1
determined
by
pr1
;
assign
the
fourth
cusp
of
this
geometric
generic
ﬁber
the
label
∗.
Since
α
∈
AutIFC
(Π2
),
it
follows
that
α
induces
[relative
to
p1
or
p2
]
the
identity
permutation
of
the
conjugacy
classes
of
cuspidal
inertia
groups
of
Π1
.
Since
cuspidal
inertia
groups
associated
to
∗
may
be
characterized
by
the
property
that
they
are
contained
in
Ξ2
,
we
thus
conclude
that
α
induces
the
identity
permutation
of
the
conjugacy
classes
of
cuspidal
inertia
groups
of
Π2/1
.
Now
let
us
ﬁx
a
cuspidal
inertia
group
Ia
⊆
Π2/1
associated
to
the
cusp
labeled
a.
Thus,
α(Ia
)
=
ζ
·
Ia
·
ζ
−1
,
for
some
ζ
∈
Π2/1
.
Since
α
∈
AutIFC
(Π2
),
and
def
Ja
=
p2
(Ia
)
is
normally
terminal
in
Π1
[cf.
[20],
Proposition
1.2,
(ii)],
it
thus
follows
that
p2
(ζ)
∈
Ja
,
so
[by
replacing
ζ
by
an
appropriate
element
∈
ζ
·Ia
]
we
may

Π1\2
=
Ξ2
.
Thus,
by
replacing
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
ζ
∈
Π2/1
α
by
the
composite
of
α
with
a
Ξ2
-inner
automorphism,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
α(Ia
)
=
Ia
.
By
[20],
Proposition
1.5,
(i),
it
follows
that
there
exists
a
unique
[i.e.,
among
its
Π2/1
-conjugates]
major
verticial
subgroup
ΠFb
at
b
(respectively,
ΠFc
at
c)
such
that
Ia
⊆
ΠFb
(respectively,
Ia
⊆
ΠFc
).
By
the
nonresp’d
portion
of
Proposition
1.3,
(iv)
[which
is
applicable
since
α
∈
AutIFC
(Π2
)!
—
cf.
Remark

we
thus
conclude
that
α(ΠFb

α(ΠFc

—
where
the
inductive
limit
is
taken
in
the
category
of
pro-Σ
groups.
In
particular,
Π2/1
is
topologically
generated
by
ΠFb
,
ΠFc
.
Proof.
In
the
following,
we
shall
denote
the
usual
topological
fundamental
group
by
“π1top
(−)”.
We
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
k
is
the
ﬁeld
C
of
complex
numbers.
Then,
as
is
well-known,
the
topology
of
a
stable
curve
may
be
understood
—
from
the
point
of
view
of
“pants
decompositions”
[cf.,
e.g.,
[1],
Chapter
2]
—
as
the
result
of
collapsing
various
“partition
curves”
on
a
hyperbolic
Riemann
surface
to
points
[which
form
the
nodes
of
the
stable
curve].
In
particular,
in
the
case
of
interest,
one
obtains
that
ΠFb
⊆
Π2/1
,
ΠFc
⊆
Π2/1
may
be
described
in
the
following
fashion:
Write
V
for
the
Riemann
surface
obtained
by
removing
the
points
{0,
3,
−3}
from
the
complex
plane
C.
Write
D+
(respectively,
D−
)
for
the
intersection
with
V
of
the
open
disc
of
radius
3
centered
at
1
(respectively,
−1).
Note
that
V
is
equipped
with
a
holomorphic
automorphism
ι
:
V
→
V
given
by
“multiplication
by
−1”;
ι(D+
)
=
D−
,
ι(D−
)
=
D+
.
Let
us
think
of
−3,
0,
3
as
corresponding,
respectively,
to
the
cusps
b,
a,
c.
Then
we
may
think
of
Π2/1
as
the
pro-Σ
completion
of
π1top
(V
)
and
of
ΠFb
⊆
Π2/1
as
corresponding,
at
least
up
to
Π2/1
-conjugacy,
to
the
pro-Σ
completion
of
π1top
(D−
)
⊆
π1top
(V
).
By
transport
of
structure
via
ι,
we
then
obtain
that
we
may
think
of
ΠFc
⊆
Π2/1
as
corresponding,
at
least
up
to
Π2/1
-conjugacy,
to
the
pro-Σ
completion
of
π1top
(D+
)
⊆
π1top
(V
).
As
in
the
proof
of
Corollary
1.12,
we
may
rigidify
the
various
conjugacy
indeterminacies
by
taking
the
basepoints
of
π1top
(V
),
π1top
(D+
),
and
π1top
(D−
)
to
be
the
point
i
∈
C
and
taking
Ia
⊆
Π2/1
to
correspond
to
the
subgroup
topologically
generated
by
the
element
of
π1top
(V
)
determined
by
the

circle
γa
of
radius
1
centered
at
a
[i.e.,
0],
oriented
counterclockwise
[so
γa
⊆
D+
D−
].
Thus,
if
one
takes
γb
(respectively,
γc
)
to
be
a
loop
in
V
,
oriented
counterclockwise,
given
by
a
slight
deformation
of
the
path
obtained
by
traveling
from
i
to
b
(respectively,
c)
and
then
back
to
i
along
the
line
segment
from
i
to
b
(respectively,
c),
then
γb
⊆
D−
,
γc
⊆
D+
.
Moreover,
as
is
well-known
from
the
“van
Kampen
theorem”
in
elementary
algebraic
topology
[cf.
also
the
more
combinatorial
point
of
view
discussed
in
the
proof
of
Proposition

D−
)
is
naturally
isomorphic
to
the
inductive
limit,
1.5,
(iii)],
π1top
(V
)
=
π1top
(D+
in
the
category
of
groups,
of
the
diagram

D−
)
→
π1top
(D+
)
π1top
(D−
)
←
π1top
(D+

D−
)
—
where
we
observe
that
π1top
(D−
)
is
generated
by
γa
and
γb
,
π1top
(D+
top
is
generated
by
γa
,
and
π1
(D+
)
is
generated
by
γa
and
γc
.
Thus,
Lemma
1.13
follows
by
passing
to
pro-Σ
completions.
Remark
1.13.1.
In
the
notation
of
Corollary
1.12
and
its
proof,
we
observe
that
the
isomorphism
of
Lemma
1.13
suggests
that
it
may
be
possible
to
verify
that
the
natural
injection
OutFC
(Π2
)
→
OutFC
(Π1
)
of
Corollary
1.12,
(ii),
is
surjective
[hence
an
isomorphism]
via
the
following
argument:
Let
β1
∈
AutFC
(Π1
).
Then
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
β1
arises
[via
p1
]
from
COMBINATORIAL
CUSPIDALIZATION
31
an
element
of
AutFC
(Π2
).
Fix
a
“rigidiﬁed
triple”
ΠF
b
⊇
Ia
⊆
ΠF
c
as
in
the
proof
of
Corollary
1.12.
Let
us
assume,
for
simplicity,
that
β1
(Ja
)
=
Ja
[where
we
recall
that
Ja
=
p2
(Ia
)].
Next,
let
us
observe
that
p2
induces
isomor∼
∼
phisms
ΠFb
→
Π1
,
ΠFc
→
Π1
which
coincide
on
Ia
⊆
ΠFb
,
Ia
⊆
ΠFc
.
Thus,
it
follows
formally
from
the
isomorphism
of
Lemma
1.13
that
there
exists
a
unique
automorphism
β2/1
of
Π2/1
that
is
compatible,
relative
to
p2
,
with
the
automorphism
β1
of
Π1
.
In
particular,
β2/1
constitutes
a
natural
candidate
for
[the
restriction
to
Π2/1
of]
a
lifting
of
β1
to
AutFC
(Π2
).
On
the
other
hand,
unfortunately,
it
is
not
clear
whether
or
not
β2/1
,
constructed
in
this
way,
stabilizes
the
Π2/1
-conjugacy
class
of
the
cuspidal
inertia
groups
associated
to
the
cusp
∗.
In
particular,
this
argument
alone
is
not
suﬃcient
to
construct
a
lifting
of
β1
to
AutFC
(Π2
)
from
β2/1
.
Remark
1.13.2.
Another
[perhaps
more
fundamental!]
problem
with
the
approach
proposed
in
Remark
1.13.1
is
the
following.
If
one
already
knows
that
β1
∈
AutFC
(Π1
)
arises
[via
p1
]
from
some
β2
∈
AutFC
(Π2
),
then
one
wishes
for
the
explicit
construction
of
β2/1
that
is
applied
to
give
rise
to
the
outer
automorphism
of
Π2/1
obtained
by
restricting
β2
to
Π2/1
.
For
instance,
if
β1
is
inner,
then
it
arises
from
a
β2
∈
AutFC
(Π2
)
which
is
inner.
Moreover,
in
order
to
pass
from
the
β2/1
constructed
from
an
arbitrary
β1
∈
AutFC
(Π1
)
by
applying
the
natural
isomor∼
out
phism
Π2
→
Π2/1

Π1
[cf.
§0;
Remark
1.1.1],
it
is
of
crucial
importance
for
the
explicit
construction
β1

β2/1
to
be
a
homomorphism
which
yields
the
restriction
to
Π2/1
of
an
inner
lifting
to
AutFC
(Π2
)
when
applied
to
an
inner
β1
.
On
the
other
hand,
if
β1
is
a
non-trivial
inner
automorphism
of
Π1
,
then
[as
is
easily
veriﬁed]
corresponding
to
the
there
do
not
exist
cuspidal
inertia
groups
Jb
,
Jc
⊆
Πtripod
1
cusps
labeled
b,
c
such
that
β1
(Ja
)
=
Ja
,
β1
(Jb
)
=
Jb
,
β1
(Jc
)
=
Jc
.
In
particular,
in
the
case
of
such
an
arbitrary
inner
β1
,
one
may
not
apply
the
non-resp’d
portion
of
Proposition
1.3,
(iv),
to
conclude
that
the
Π2/1
-conjugacy
classes
of
major
and
minor
verticial
subgroups
or
nexus
subgroups
of
Π2/1
are
preserved
by
an
inner
lifting
β2
.
Instead,
one
may
only
apply
the
resp’d
portion
of
Proposition
1.3,
(iv),
to
conclude
that
the
Π2
-conjugacy
classes
of
such
subgroups
are
preserved
by
β2
—
which
is
insuﬃcient
for
the
execution
of
the
construction
of
Remark
1.13.1
[i.e.,
of
the
proof
of
Corollary
1.12].
Corollary

(Modular
Symmetries

Suppose
that
X
log
is
a

Let
n
≥

Then:
(i)
The

If,

the

the

surjection
Πm

Πm−1

that

then
we
have

Let
x
be
as
in
Corollary

Write
π
:
Πn

Π1
for
the
standard

Then
there
exists
an

σ

such
that
the
32

of

an
outer

∼
ΠEx

Π1
that
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
ΠEx
among
its
Πn
-conjugates.
(iii)
Suppose
that
we
are
in
the
situation
of
(ii).
Let
α
∈
OutFC
(Πn

;
α|Ex
∈

the

of
applying
the

[cf.

ασ1

the

automorphism
of
Π1
induced
by
ασ
via
π.
[Thus,
α
=
ασ
whenever
α
∈
OutFCS
(Πn
).]
Then
α|Ex
and
ασ1
are
compatible
with
the
outer
isomorphism
∼
ΠEx
→
Π1
of
(ii).
In
particular,
if
α|Ex
∈
OutFC
(ΠEx
)S
,
then
ασ
∈
OutFC
(Πn
)S
.
(iv)
We
have:
OutFCS
(Πn
)
⊆
OutFC
(Πn
)+
.
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
We
apply
induction
on
n.
First,
let
us
log
∼
observe
that
relative
to
the
natural
isomorphism
Xnlog
→
(M0,n+3
)k
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(vi)],
the
divisors
of
Xn
that
belong
to
Dn∗
[cf.
Proposition
1.3,
(vii)]
log
are
precisely
the
divisors
at
inﬁnity
of
(M0,n+3
)k
whose
generic
points
parametrize
stable
curves
of
genus
zero
with
precisely
two
components,
one
of
which
contains
precisely
two
cusps.
[Indeed,
this
follows
immediately
from
the
well-known
log
log
geometry
of
(M0,n+3
)k
.]
In
particular,
the
automorphisms
of
(M0,n+3
)k
arising
from
the
permutations
of
the
ordering
of
the
cusps
permute
the
divisors
that
belong
to
Dn∗
.
Thus,
we
conclude
that
the
outer
modular
symmetries
∈
Out(Πn
)
normalize
OutQS
(Πn
)
=
OutFC
(Πn
)cusp
[cf.
Proposition
1.3,
(vii)].
Now
let
τ
∈
Out(Πn
)
be
an
outer
modular
symmetry
that
arises
from
a
permutation
of
the
subset
{a,
b,
c,
1,
2,
.
.
.
,
n
−
1}
⊆
{a,
b,
c,
1,
2,
.
.
.
,
n
−
1,
n}
[cf.
the
notation
of

OutFC
(Πn
)S
⊆
OutQS
(Πn
)
[cf.
PropoDeﬁnition
1.1,
(vi)];
α
∈
OutFCP
(Πn
)
def
sition
1.3,
(vii)];
ατ
=
τ
−1
◦
α
◦
τ
∈
OutQS
(Πn
).
Then
since
τ
is
compatible
with
the
standard
surjection
Πn

Πn−1
,
it
follows
from
the
induction
hypothesis
that
α,
ατ
map
to
the
same
element
∈
OutQS
(Πn−1
)
via
the
natural
homomorphism
OutQS
(Πn
)
→
OutQS
(Πn−1
)
induced
by
this
surjection.
Thus,
we
conclude
from
the
injectivity
condition
in
the
statement
of
assertion
(i)
[cf.
also
Proposition
1.3,
(vii)]
that
α
=
ατ
.
Since
the
group
of
all
permutations
of
the
set
{a,
b,
c,
1,
2,
.
.
.
,
n
−
1,
n}
is
generated
by
the
subgroups
of
permutations
of
the
subsets
{a,
b,
c,
1,
2,
.
.
.
,
n
−
1}
⊆
{a,
b,
c,
1,
2,
.
.
.
,
n
−
1,
n}
and
{1,
2,
.
.
.
,
n
−
1,
n}
⊆
{a,
b,
c,
1,
2,
.
.
.
,
n
−
1,
n},
we
thus
conclude
that
α
∈
OutFCS
(Πn
).
This
completes

the
proof
that
OutFCP
(Πn
)
OutFC
(Πn
)S
⊆
OutFCS
(Πn
);
the
opposite
inclusion
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
In
light
of
Corollary
1.10,
(ii),
assertions
(ii)
and
(iii)
follow
immediately
log
from
the
deﬁnitions
and
the
well-known
geometry
of
Xnlog
[i.e.,
(M0,n+3
)k
].
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iv).
By
assertion
(iii),
it
follows
that
the
image
of
the
restriction
OutFCS
(Πn
)
→
OutFC
(ΠEx
)
to
OutFCS
(Πn
)
of
the
natural
homomorphism
of
Corollary
1.10,
(iii),
lies
in
OutFC
(ΠEx
)
.
Write

[so

:
Πn

Π1
—
which
is

implies
that
the

COMBINATORIAL

OutFCS

This
implies
the

and

Section

Injectivity
for
Degenerating

In
the
present
§2,
we
generalize
[cf.
Corollary

(ii)]
the
injectivity
asserted
in
Corollary
1.12,
(ii),
to
the
case
of
arbitrary
X
log
such
that
UX
is
aﬃne,
by
considering
what
happens
when
we
allow
X
log
to
degenerate.
Let
def

k
be
as
in

def

R◦
=

[[t]]
—
i.e.,
the

of

series
with
coeﬃcients
in
k◦
;
·
K◦
the
quotient
ﬁeld
of
R◦
;
def

K
an
algebraic

with

Thus,
we

By

obtain

this

we
thus
obtain

Thus,

apply
the

—
to
which
we
may
apply
the

discussed

Deﬁnition

Let

Suppose
that

one

if

we

Write

Suppose

Let

Observe

the

maps

Let

to

Thus,
the

Moreover,
pr2

Write

Thus,

Thus,
UE
x
is
a

pr2

determined

Thus,

we

Write

we

Corollary
2.3.
(Injectivity
for
Non-tripod
Degenerating
Aﬃne
Curves)
In
the
notation
of
Deﬁnition
2.1
[cf.
also
Deﬁnition
1.1;
Remark
2.1.1]:
(i)
The
natural
inclusion
Ξ2
→
AutIFC
(Π2
)
is
an
isomorphism.
(ii)
The
natural
homomorphism
OutFC
(Π2
)
→
OutFC
(Π1
)
induced
by
p1
:
Π2

Π1
is
injective.
(iii)
We
have:
OutFCP
(Π2
)
=
OutFC
(Π2
).
Proof.
First,
we
observe
that
assertion
(ii)
follows
formally
from
assertion
(i)
and
Proposition
1.2,
(iii).
Next,
we
observe
that
assertion
(iii)
follows
formally
from
assertion
(ii)
and
Propositions
1.2,
(iii);
1.6,
(iii).
Thus,
to
complete
the
proof
of
Corollary
2.3,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
assertion
(i).
To
this
end,
let
α
∈
AutIFC
(Π2
).
Let
us
ﬁx
some
Πνx
⊆
Π2/1
among
its
various
Π2/1
-conjugates;
let
ΠEx
,
Πν̈x
,
ΠT̈
,
ΠFx
,
ΠËx
,
and
Πtripod
be
as
in
Proposition
2.2,
(ii).
2/1
Since
α
∈
AutIFC
(Π2
),
it
follows
that
α
induces
[relative
to
p1
or
p2
]
an
automorphism
of
Π1
that
stabilizes
every
cuspidal
inertia
group
of
Π1
.
Thus,
by
the
non-resp’d
portion
of
Proposition
1.3,
(iv),
we
conclude
that
α
stabilizes
the
Π2/1
-conjugacy
classes
of
Πνx
=
Πν̈x
,
ΠFx
,
ΠEx
=
ΠËx
.
In
particular,
α(Πνx
)
=
ζ
·
Πνx
·
ζ
−1
,
for
some
ζ
∈
Π2/1
.
Since
α
∈
AutIFC
(Π2
),
and
p2
(Πνx
)
is
a
cuspidal
inertia
group
of
Π1
associated
to
x,
hence
normally
terminal
in
Π1
[cf.
[20],
Proposition
1.2,
(ii)],
it
thus
follows
that
p2
(ζ)
∈
p2
(Πνx
),
so
[by
replacing
ζ
by
an
appropriate
element
∈
ζ
·
Πνx
]
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that

ζ
∈
Π2/1
Π1\2
=
Ξ2
.
Thus,
by
replacing
α
by
the
composite
of
α
with
a
Ξ2
-inner
automorphism,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
α(Πνx
)
=
Πνx
.
By
Proposition
2.2,
(ii),
we
thus
conclude
that
α(ΠFx
)
=
ΠFx
,
α(ΠEx
)
=
ΠEx
.
Since
∼
α
∈
AutIFC
(Π2
),
and
p2
induces
an
isomorphism
ΠFx
→
Π1
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.1,
(v)],
we
thus
conclude
that
α
restricts
to
the
identity
on
ΠFx
.
In
particular,
it
follows
is
topologically
that
α
stabilizes
and
restricts
to
the
identity
on
ΠT̈
.
Since
Πtripod
2/1
generated
by
ΠËx
=
ΠEx
,
ΠT̈
[cf.
Proposition
2.2,
(iii)],
we
thus
conclude
that
tripod
α(Πtripod
2/1
)
=
Π2/1
.
Now
since
α
∈
AutIFC
(Π2
),
and
Πtripod
is
normally
terminal
in
Π2/1
[cf.
Propo2/1
sition
2.2,
(i)],
we
thus
conclude
from
the
commutative
diagram
of
Deﬁnition
2.1,
∼
out
→
Πtripod

Πtripod
—
cf.
(vi)
[i.e.,
by
applying
the
natural
isomorphism
Πtripod
2
1
2/1
§0;
Remark
1.1.1],
that
the
automorphism
of
Πtripod
induced
by
α
arises
from
an
2/1
automorphism
αtripod
∈
Aut(Πtripod
),
which
is
easily
veriﬁed
to
be
F-admissible
2
[cf.
Proposition
1.2,
(i)].
Next,
observe
that
since
ΠËx
is
normally
terminal
in
Π2/1
[cf.
Proposition
2.2,
(i)],
it
follows
immediately
from
[20],
Proposition
1.5,
(i),
that
every
cuspidal
inertia
group
of
Π2/1
that
is
contained
in
ΠËx
and
Π2/1
conjugate
to
a
cuspidal
inertia
group
associated
to
a
cusp
of
UËx
is,
in
fact,
equal
40
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
to
a
cuspidal
inertia
group
associated
to
a
cusp
of
UËx
.
Since
α
is
C-admissible,
and
α
∈
AutIFC
(Π2
)
restricts
to
the
identity
on
ΠT̈
,
we
thus
conclude
that
αtripod
is
IFC-admissible,
i.e.,
αtripod
∈
AutIFC
(Πtripod
).
2
On
the
other
hand,
by
Corollary
1.12,
(i),
it
follows
that
αtripod
lies
in
the
→
AutIFC
(Πtripod
)
[where
we
write
Ξtripod
image
of
the
natural
inclusion
Ξtripod
2
2
2
for
the
analogue
of
“Ξ2
”
for
Πtripod
].
In
particular,
we
conclude
that
α
induces
2
an
inner
automorphism
of
Πtripod
2/1
.
Since
α
restricts
to
the
identity
on
ΠT̈
,
which
is
center-free
[cf.
Remark
1.1.1]
and
normally
terminal
in
Πtripod
[cf.
Proposition
2/1
2.2,
(i)],
it
thus
follows
that
α
restricts
to
the
identity
on
Πtripod
2/1
,
hence
also
on
ΠËx
=
ΠEx
.
Since
Π2/1
is
topologically
generated
by
ΠEx
,
ΠFx
[cf.
Proposition
2.2,
(iii)],
we
thus
conclude
that
α
restricts
to
the
identity
on
Π2/1
,
hence
[by
applying
∼
out
the
natural
isomorphism
Π2
→
Π2/1

Π1
—
cf.
§0;
Remark
1.1.1]
that
α
is
the
identity.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Before
proceeding,
we
recall
the
following
well-known
result.
Lemma
2.4.
(FC-Admissible
Permutations
of
Cusps)
There
exist
elFC
ements
∈
Out
(Πn
)
that
induce,
relative
to
the
standard
surjection
Πn

Π1
,
arbitrary
permutations
of
the
set
of
conjugacy
classes
of
cuspidal
inertia
groups
of
Π1
[i.e.,
the
set
of
cusps
of
X
log
].
Proof.
One
way
to
verify
Lemma
2.4
is
by
thinking
of
Πn
as
the
pro-Σ
completion
of
the
topological
fundamental
group
of
the
n-th
conﬁguration
space
associated
to
[i.e.,
the
complement
of
the
various
diagonals
in
the
product
of
n
copies
of]
a
topological
surface
X
of
type
(g,
r)
[cf.
the
theory
of
[24],
§7].
Then
it
is
easy
to
construct
a
homeomorphism
of
X
that
induces
an
arbitrary
permutation
of
the
cusps;
one
then
veriﬁes
immediately
that
such
a
homeomorphism
induces
a
homeomorphism
of
the
n-th
conﬁguration
space
associated
to
X
that
gives
rise
to
an
element
∈
OutFC
(Πn
)
satisfying
the
conditions
in
the
statement
of
Lemma
2.4.
Alternatively,
one
may
give
a
more
log
scheme-theoretic
proof
by
means
of
the
objects
introduced
in
the
discussion
preceding
Deﬁnition
2.1
as
follows.
If
r
≤
1,
then
there
is
nothing
to
show.
Thus,
we
suppose
that
r
≥
2.
Then
[by
applying
the
specialization
isomorphisms
of
§0]
it
suﬃces
to
verify
the
existence
of
automorphisms
of
Xslog
over
slog
that
induce
arbitrary
transpositions
[i.e.,
permutations
that
switch
two
elements
and
leave
the
remaining
elements
ﬁxed]
of
the
set
of
cusps
of
Xslog
.
If
(g,
r)
=
(0,
3)
[i.e.,
Xslog
is
a
tripod],
then
the
existence
of
such
automorphisms
of
Xslog
[over
slog
]
follows
immediately
from
the
well-known
structure
of
tripods.
Thus,
we
may
assume
that
(g,
r)
=
(0,
3).
This
assumption
implies
[cf.
Remark
2.1.1]
that
we
may
suppose
that
we
are
in
the
situation
of
Deﬁnition
2.1,
and
that
precisely
two
of
the
cusps
of
the
tripod
UT
arise
from
cusps
a,
b
of
Xslog
.
Then
[by
the
case
where
(g,
r)
=
(0,
3),
which
has
already
been
veriﬁed]
UT
admits
an
automorphism
[over
s]
that
switches
the
two
cusps
of
UT
corresponding
to
a,
b
and
leaves
the
remaining
cusp
of
UT
ﬁxed.
Moreover,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
COMBINATORIAL
CUSPIDALIZATION
41
that
such
an
automorphism
of
UT
extends
to
an
automorphism
of
Xslog
[over
slog
]
that
switches
a
and
b
and
restricts
to
the
identity
on
Q
[hence
leaves
the
remaining
cusps
of
Xslog
ﬁxed].
This
completes
the
proof
of
Lemma
2.4.
Section
3:
Conditional
Surjectivity
for
Aﬃne
Curves
In
the
present
§3,
we
prove
a
certain
special
case
[cf.
Corollary
3.3]
of
the
surjectivity
portion
of
our
main
result
[cf.
Theorem
4.1
below]
for
aﬃne
hyperbolic
curves.
The
key
observation
is
that
the
technical
obstacles
observed,
relative
to
verifying
surjectivity,
in
Remarks
1.13.1,
1.13.2
may
be
circumvented
if
one
replaces
“Π2

Π1
”
by
“Π3

Π2
”
and
works
with
the
subset
“+”
of
Deﬁnition
1.11,
(ii).
We
return
to
the
notation
of
§1
[cf.
especially
the
notation
of
Deﬁnition
1.4
and
of
the
discussion
preceding
Deﬁnition
1.8].
Deﬁnition
3.1.
Let
x
∈
X(k)
be
a
cusp
of
X
log
.
Write
x
∈
X2
(k)
for
the
nexus
νx
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.4,
(i)].
(i)
Observe
that
the
log
structure
on
X3log
determines
on
the
ﬁber
(X3
)x
of
the
morphism
pr12
:
X3
→
X2
over
the
point
x
∈
X2
(k)
a
structure
of
pointed
stable
curve,
which
consists
of
three
irreducible
components.
Of
these
three
irreducible
components,
there
is
a
unique
irreducible
component
F
x
—
which
we
shall
refer
to
as
the
quasi-major
cuspidal
component
of
(X3
)x
—
that
maps
isomorphically
to
X
via
pr3
:
X3
→
X1
=
X;
there
is
a
unique
irreducible
component
Lx
—
which
we
shall
refer
to
as
the
link
cuspidal
component
of
(X3
)x
—
that
intersects
F
x
at
a
single
point;
there
is
a
unique
irreducible
component
E
x
—
which
we
shall
refer
to
as
the
quasi-minor
cuspidal
component
of
(X3
)x
—
that
intersects
Lx
at
a
single
point.
[Thus,
Lx
,
E
x
map
to
the
point
x
∈
X(k)
via
pr3
.]
The
complement
in
F
x
(respectively,
Lx
;
E

)
of
the
nodes
and
cusps
[relative
to
the
pointed
stable
curve
structure
on
(X3
)x
]
of
F
x
(respectively,
Lx
;
E
x
)
—
which
we
shall
refer
to
as
the
interior
UF
x
of
F
x
(respectively,
ULx
of
Lx
;
UE
x
of
E
x
)
—
determines
a
hyperbolic
curve
UF
x
(respectively,
tripod
ULx
;
tripod
UE
x
).
Moreover,
pr3
induces
∼
∼
isomorphisms
UF
x
→
UX
,
F
x
→
X.
(ii)
By
applying
the
specialization
isomorphisms
[cf.
§0]
associated
to
the
log
restriction
of
prlog
→
X2log
to
the
completion
of
X2
along
x,
we
conclude
12
:
X3
that
the
pointed
stable
curve
structure
on
(X3
)x
[cf.
(i)]
determines
a
“semi-graph
of
anabelioids
of
pro-Σ
PSC-type”
as
discussed
in
[20],
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(i)
[cf.
also
the
discussion
of
[18],
Appendix]
whose
associated
“PSC-fundamental
group”
may
be
identiﬁed
with
Π3/2
.
In
particular,
the
quasi-major,
link,
and
quasi-minor
cuspidal
components
determine
[conjugacy
classes
of]
verticial
subgroups
[cf.
[20],

42
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
—
which
we
shall
refer
to
as
quasi-major,
link,
and
quasi-minor,
respectively.
Thus,
the
morphism
p3
:
Π3
→
Π1
determines
an
isomorphism
∼
ΠF
x
→
Π1
—
i.e.,
the
quasi-major
verticial
subgroups
may
be
thought
of
as
deﬁning
sections
of
the
projection
p3
:
Π3

Π1
.
On
the
other
hand,
p3
maps
ΠLx
,
ΠE
x
onto
cuspidal
inertia
groups
of
Π1
associated
to
x;
in
particular,
p3
(ΠLx
),
p3
(ΠEx
)
are
abelian.


Finally,
let
us
refer
to
the
node
ν
x
∈
E
x
Lx
(respectively,
μx
∈
Lx
F
x
)
of
(X2
)x
as
the
x-minor-nexus
(respectively,
x-major-nexus)
[of
(X3

]
—
so
[cf.
Fig.

E
x

ν
x
∈
Lx

μx

—
and
to
the

subgroup
[cf.

Deﬁnition
1.1,

Πν
x
⊆
Π3/2
(respectively,
Πμ
⊆
Π3/2
)
x
determined
up
to
conjugacy
by
ν
x
(respectively,
μx
)
as
an
x-minor-nexus
(respectively,
x-major-nexus)
subgroup.
Thus,
for
suitable
choices
within
the
various
conjugacy
classes
involved,
we
have
natural
inclusions
⊇
ΠE
x
Πν
x
⊆
ΠLx
⊇
Πμ

ΠF
x
[inside

We

refer
to

(respectively,
B
μ
=
Lx

F
x)
as
the
ν-bridge
(respectively,
μ-bridge)
of
(X3
)x
.
If
the
various
choices
within
conjugacy
classes
are
made
so
that
the
natural
inclusions
of
(ii)
hold,
then
we
shall
refer
to
the
subgroup
[well-deﬁned
up
to
Π3/2

ΠBν

Π3/2
(respectively,
ΠBμ
⊆

)
topologically
generated
by
ΠE
x
and
ΠLx
(respectively,
by
ΠLx
and
ΠF

)
as
the
ν-bridge
subgroup
(respectively,
μ-bridge
subgroup).
(iv)
Recall
the
subgroups
IFx
⊆
DFx
⊆
Π2
(respectively,
IEx
⊆
DEx
⊆
Π2
)
of
Proposition
1.6
(respectively,
1.7).
By
applying
the
specialization
isomorphisms
of
§0
ﬁrst
over
the
completion
of
Fx
(respectively,
Ex
)
along
x,
and
then
over
the
completion
of
X2
along
the
generic
point
of
UFx
(respectively,
UEx
),
we
conclude
that
the
outer
action
of
DFx
(respectively,
DEx
)
on
Π3/2
stabilizes
the
Π3/2
-conjugacy
classes
of
ΠE
x
,
Πν
x
,
and
ΠBμ
(respectively,
of
ΠBν
,

,
and

).
Since,
morex
over,
ΠE
x
,
Πν
x
,
and
ΠBμ
(respectively,
of
ΠB
ν
,
Πμ
,
and
ΠF
x
)
are
commensurably
x
terminal
in
Π3/2
[cf.
Proposition
3.2,
(i),
below],
it
follows
that
this
outer
action
COMBINATORIAL
CUSPIDALIZATION
43
determines
outer
actions
of
DFx
(respectively,
DEx
)
on
ΠE
x
,
Πν
x
,
and
ΠBμ
(respectively,
of

and
ΠF

),
whose
restriction
to
IFx
(respectively,

is
trivial
x
[cf.

Thus,
we
obtain

outer

though
the

may
think

the

[Here,
we
note
that
it

—
i.e.,
not

—
since
this

allows

to
ignore
the
issue

“precisely

In

μ

it

[cf.
Proposition
3.2,

is

Thus,
it
makes
sense
to
glue

β3/2

along

as
in
Proposition
3.2,
(iv),
that
restricts
to
β3/2
on

and
to

on
ΠBν
.
Next,
we
consider
the
extent
to
which
β3/2
is
compatible,
relative
to
α2/1
,
with
the
natural
outer
action
of
Π2/1
on
Π3/2
.
In
particular,
let
us
consider
the
following
assertion:
(∗)
β3/2
∈
OutFC
(Π3/2
)
is
compatible,
relative
to
α2/1
,
with
the
natural
outer
actions
of
ΠEx
(⊆
Π2/1
)
and
ΠFx
(⊆
Π2/1
)
on
Π3/2
.
Now
I
claim
that
to
complete
the
proof
of
Corollary
3.3,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
(∗).
Indeed,
since
Π2/1
is
topologically
generated
by
ΠEx
,
ΠFx
[cf.
Proposition
1.5,
48
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
(iii)],
it
follows
from
(∗)
that
β3/2
∈
OutFC
(Π3/2
)
is
compatible,
relative
to
α2/1
,
with
the
natural
outer
action
of
Π2/1
.
Thus,
by
applying
the
natural
isomorphism
∼
out
Π3/1
→
Π3/2

Π2/1
[cf.
§0;
Remark
1.1.1],
we
conclude
that
β3/2
,
α2/1
determine
an
element
β3/1
∈
Out(Π3/1
).
It
is
immediate
from
the
construction
of
β3/1
that
β3/1
is
C-admissible.
Since
β3/1
preserves
the
conjugacy
class
of
inertia
groups
associated
to
the
diagonal
divisor
in
the
geometric
generic
ﬁber
of
pr1
:
X3
→
X1
[cf.
the
argument
applied
in
the
proof
of
Proposition
1.3,
(vii)],
it
follows
from
Proposition
1.2,
(i),
that
β3/1
is
FC-admissible,
i.e.,
β3/1
∈
OutFC
(Π3/1
).
Next,
let
us
write
α1
∈
OutFC
(Π1
)
for
the
automorphism
induced
by
α3
via
p1
:
Π3

Π1
.
Since
the
natural
homomorphism
OutFC
(Π3/1
)
→
OutFC
(Π2/1
)
is
injective
by
Corollary
2.3,
(ii),
we
thus
conclude
[from
the
fact

Finally,

To

let

observe
that

that
correspond
to
the

That
is
to

corresponds
to
the
operation
of
“forgetting

In

In

determined

[cf.

normalizes

Then

By

if

if

and

Proof.
First,
we
consider
the
injectivity
portion
of
assertion
(i).
Consider
the
natural
isomorphisms
∼
out
Πn
→
Kn−2

Πn−2
;
out
∼
Πn−1
→
(Kn−2
/Kn−1
)

Πn−2
[cf.
§0;
Remark
1.1.1],
together
with
the
interpretation
of
Πn/n−2
=
Kn−2

Kn−2
/Kn−1
=
Πn−1/n−2
as
the
“Π2

Π1
”
[i.e.,
the
projection
that
arises
by
forgetting
the
factor
labeled
2]
associated
to
an
“X
log
”
of
type
(g,
r
+n−2)
[cf.
[24],
Proposition
2.4,
(i)].
[Here,
we
note
that
one
veriﬁes
easily
that
this
“interpretation”
is
compatible
with
the
deﬁnition
of
the
various
“OutFC
(−)’s”
involved.]
Now
the
above
natural
isomorphisms
allow
one
to
reduce
the
injectivity
portion
of
assertion
(i)
to
the
case
n
=
2,
r
≥
1,
which
follows
immediately
from
Corollaries
1.12,
(ii);
2.3,
(ii)
[cf.
also
Remark
2.1.1].
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
injectivity
portion
of
assertion
(i).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
Let
α
∈
OutFC
(Πn
).
Write
α
for
the
image
def
def
of
α
in
OutFC
(Πn−1
);
ασ
=
σ
·
α
·
σ
−1
;
ασ
=
σ

·
α
·
(σ

)−1
.
Then
it
follows
immediately
from
property
(a)
that
ασ
is
F-admissible
and
from
properties
(b),
(c),
(d)
that
ασ
is
C-admissible.
Thus,
ασ
∈
OutFC
(Πn
).
If,
moreover,
it
holds
that
α
=
ασ
,
then
it
follows
from
the
injectivity
portion
of
assertion
(i)
that
α
=
ασ
.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iv).
When
n
=
2,
assertion
(iv)
follows
immediately
from
Proposition
1.6,
(iii);
Corollaries
1.12,
(iii);
2.3,
(iii)
[cf.
also
Remark
2.1.1].
Note
that
when
n
≥
3,
by
applying
the
natural
isomorphism
∼
out
Πn
→
Kn−2

Πn−2
[cf.
§0;
Remark
1.1.1],
together
with
the
interpretation
of
Πn/n−2
=
Kn−2
as
the
“Π2
”
associated
to
an
“X
log
”
of
type
(g,
r
+
n
−
2)
[cf.
[24],
Proposition
2.4,
(i)],
we
thus
conclude
from
“assertion
(iv)
for
n
=
2”
[whose
proof
has
already
been
completed]
that
OutFC
(Πn
)
commutes
with
the
permutation
outer
automorphism
σ
∈
Out(Πn
)
that
arises
from
the
permutation
((n
−
1)
n)
of
{1,
2,
.
.
.
,
n}
[i.e.,
the
permutation
that
switches
n
and
n
−
1
and
ﬁxes
all
other
elements
of
{1,
2,
.
.
.
,
n}].
54
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
Now
we
apply
induction
on
n.
When
UX
is
aﬃne,
let
us
observe
that
[by
the
induction
hypothesis]
every
permutation
outer
automorphism
σ
∈
Out(Πn
)
that
arises
from
a
permutation
of
{1,
2,
.
.
.
,
n}
that
ﬁxes
n
satisﬁes
the
properties
(a),
(b),
(c),
(d)
of
assertion
(iii)
in
the
resp’d
case.
Thus,
when
UX
is
aﬃne,
the
induction
step
[i.e.,
the
derivation
of
“assertion
(iv)
for
n”
from
“assertion
(iv)
for
n−1”]
follows
from
assertion
(iii),
together
with
the
fact
that
the
permutation
group
of
{1,
2,
.
.
.
,
n}
is
generated
by
“((n−1)
n)”
and
the
subgroup
of
permutations
that
ﬁx
n.
If
UX
is
proper
and
n
≥
4,
then
the
induction
step
[i.e.,
the
derivation
of
“assertion
(iv)
for
n”
from
“assertion
(iv)
for
n
−
1”]
follows
by
a
similar
argument.
Thus,
it
remains
to
verify
the
induction
step
when
UX
is
proper
and
n
=
3.
To
this
end,
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that,
as
discussed
above,
OutFC
(Π3
)
commutes
with
[the
permutation
outer
automorphism
that
arises
from
the
permutation
of
{1,
2,
3}
given
by]
(23).
Moreover,
by
applying
assertion
(iii)
in
the
non-resp’d
case
to
[the
permutation
outer
automorphism
that
arises
from
the
permutation
of
{1,
2,
3}
given
by]
(12),
we
conclude
that
(12)
normalizes
OutFC
(Π3
).
Thus,
by
conjugating
by
(12),
we
conclude
that
OutFC
(Π3
)
commutes
with
(13).
Now
since
the
group
of
permutations
of
{1,
2,
3}
is
generated
by
(12),
(13),
we
conclude
that
OutFC
(Π3
)
commutes
with
all
permutation
outer
automorphisms.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iv).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
First,
let
us
observe
that
when
(g,
r)
=
(0,
3)
and
n
=
2,
assertion
(ii)
for
the
subset
of
(a)
is
a
tautology
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.11,
(i)];
when
(g,
r)
=
(0,
3)
and
n
=
3,
assertion
(ii)
for
the
subset
of
(b)
may
be
reduced,
in
light
of
the
inclusion
OutFC
(Π2
)S
⊆
OutFC
(Π2
)+
[cf.
Corollaries
1.12,
(ii),
(iii);
1.14,
(i),
(iv)],
to
assertion
(ii)
for
the
subset
of
(a)
when
n
=
3.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
when
n
≥
4,
by
the
deﬁnition
of
“”
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.11,
(ii)],
every
element
∈
OutFC
(Πn−1/n−4
)
[where
we
recall
that
Πn−1/n−4
is
the
“Π3
”
associated
to
an
“X
log
”
of
type
(g,
r+n−4)]
that
is
induced,
relative
to
the
inclusion
Πn−1/n−4
→
Πn−1
,
by
an
element
∈
OutFC
(Πn−1
)
of
the
subset
of
(b)
maps,
via
the
natural
homomorphism
OutFC
(Πn−1/n−4
)
→
OutFC
(Πn−2/n−4
)
[obtained
by
“forgetting
the
factor
labeled
n
−
1”],
to
an
element
of
OutFC
(Πn−2/n−4
)
,
hence,
by
Corollary
3.4,
(iii),
is
contained
in
OutFC
(Πn−1/n−4
)+
;
but,
by
the
deﬁnition
of
“+”
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.11,
(ii)],
this
implies
that
every
element
of
the
subset
of
(b)
is
contained
in
OutFC
(Πn−1
)+
.
Thus,
to
complete
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii),
it
suﬃces
to
verify
assertion
(ii)
for
the
subset
of
(a)
in
the
case
of
n
≥
3.
On
the
other
∼
out
hand,
when
n
≥
3,
by
applying
the
natural
isomorphisms
Πn
→
Πn/n−3

Πn−3
,
∼
out
Πn−1
→
Πn−1/n−3

Πn−3
[cf.
the
proof
of
the
injectivity
portion
of
assertion
(i)],
together
with
the
injectivity
portion
of
assertion
(i)
[which
is
necessary
in
order
to
conclude
the
compatibility
of
liftings,
relative
to
the
natural
homomorphism
OutFC
(Πn/n−3
)
→
OutFC
(Πn−1/n−3
),
with
the
respective
outer
actions
of
Πn−3
],
to
complete
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii),
we
conclude
that
it
suﬃces
to
verify
assertion
(ii)
for
the
subset
of
(a)
in
the
case
of
n
=
3.
But
this
is
precisely
the
content
of
Corollary
3.3.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Finally,
we
consider
the
surjectivity
[i.e.,
bijectivity]
portion
of
assertion
(i)
for
n
≥
5.
First,
let
us
observe
that
by
Lemma
2.4,
to
complete
the
proof
of
COMBINATORIAL
CUSPIDALIZATION
55
assertion
(i),
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
the
image
of
the
natural
homomorphism
OutFC
(Πn
)
→
OutFC
(Πn−1
)
of
assertion
(i)
contains
the
subset
OutFC
(Πn−1
)cusp
⊆
OutFC
(Πn−1
).
Next,
let
us
observe
that
by
assertion
(iv)
and
Remark
1.1.5,
every
element
∈
OutFC
(Πn−1/n−5
)
[where
we
recall
that
Πn−1/n−5
is
the
“Π4
”
associated
to
an
“X
log
”
of
type
(g,
r
+
n
−
5)]
that
is
induced,
relative
to
the
inclusion
Πn−1/n−5
→
Πn−1
,
by
an
element
∈
OutFC
(Πn−1
)cusp
is
contained
in
OutFCP
(Πn−1/n−5
)cusp
,
hence,
by
Corollary
3.4,
(ii),
in
OutFC
(Πn−1/n−5
)+
.
But
this
implies
that
OutFC
(Πn−1
)cusp
=
OutFC
(Πn−1
)+
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.11,
(ii)].
Thus,
in
summary,
to
complete
the
proof
of
assertion
(i),
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
the
image
of
the
natural
homomorphism
OutFC
(Πn
)
→
OutFC
(Πn−1
)
of
assertion
(i)
contains
the
subset
OutFC
(Πn−1
)+
⊆
OutFC
(Πn−1
).
But
this
follows
from
assertion
(ii)
[cf.
the
subset
of
(a)].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Remark
4.1.1.
The
argument
applied
to
verify
Theorem
4.1,
(iv),
in
the
proper
case
suggests
that
even
if
one
cannot
verify
the
injectivity
of
the
homomorphism
OutFC
(Π2
)
→
OutFC
(Π1
)
in
the
proper
case,
it
may
be
possible
to
verify
the
injectivity
of
the
homomorphism
OutFC
(Π3
)
→
OutFC
(Π1
)
[i.e.,
induced
by
the
projection
obtained
by
“forgetting
the
factors
labeled
2,
3”]
in
the
proper
case.
Remark
4.1.2.
In
the
pro-l
case
[i.e.,
the
case
where
Σ
is
of
cardinality
one],
a
number
of
results
related
to
Theorem
4.1,
(i),
have
been
obtained
by
various
authors.
(i)
In
[10],
Theorem
1
[cf.
also
[8],
which
is
discussed
further
in
Remark
4.2.1,
(ii),
below],
a
similar
injectivity
result
to
that
of
Theorem
4.1,
(i),
is
obtained
in
the
pro-l
case
for
outer
automorphisms
satisfying
certain
conditions
—
i.e.,
the
conditions
“(σ1),
(σ2)”
of
[10],
Theorem
1.
It
is
immediate
[cf.
Proposition
1.3,
(vii)]
that
outer
automorphisms
lying
in
the
kernel
of
the
homomorphism
in
question
which
satisfy
these
conditions
“(σ1),
(σ2)”
are
FC-admissible.
Thus,
[at
least
when
the
condition
of
hyperbolicity
2g
−
2
+
r
>
0
is
satisﬁed]
[10],
Theorem
1,
may
be
obtained
as
a
consequence
of
Theorem
4.1,
(i).
(ii)
In
[29],
a
ﬁltered
pro-l
injectivity
result
[cf.
[29],
Theorem
4.3]
is
obtained
(n)
(n)
for
a
certain
ﬁltration
on
a
subgroup
Γg,r
⊆
Out(Πn
)
[where
Γg,r
is
as
in
[29],
(2.11)
—
except
with
“r”
and
“n”
reversed!].
It
follows
immediately
from
the
conditions
(n)
used
to
deﬁne
Γg,r
[cf.
[29],
(2.10),
(2.11)]
that
QS
(Πn
)
=
OutFC
(Πn
)cusp
Γ(n)
g,r
=
Out
[cf.
Proposition
1.3,
(vii)].
In
particular,
the
injectivity
of
Theorem
4.1,
(i),
in
the
pro-l
case
may
also
be
thought
of
as

Remark
4.1.3.
The
injectivity
of
the
restriction
of
the
homomorphism
of
Theorem
4.1,
(i),
to
an
“image
of
Galois”
⊆
OutFC
(Πn
)
that
arises
from
scheme
theory
is
precisely
the
content
of
[14],
Theorem
2.2.
Indeed,
it
was
precisely
the
goal
of
attaining
a
more
abstract,
combinatorial
understanding
of
the
theory
of
[14]
that
motivated
the
author
to
develop
the
theory
of
the
present
paper.
Also,
we
observe
that
the
remaining
portion
of
[14],
Theorem
2.2
—
involving
related
outer
actions
on
Πtripod
—
follows
immediately
from
the
existence
of
the
natural
outer
homomorphism
of
Corollary
1.10,
(iii).
Remark
4.1.4.
(i)
Observe
that
the
various
“Πn
”
that
arise
from
diﬀerent
“X
log
’s”
of
the
same
type
(g,
r)
are
always
isomorphic,
in
a
fashion
that
is
compatible
with
the
various
ﬁber
subgroups
and
cuspidal
inertia
groups
of
subquotients.
Indeed,
this
follows
immediately
[cf.
the
various
“specialization
isomorphisms”
discussed
in
§0]
from
the
well-known
fact
[cf.,
[3]]
that
the
moduli
stack
Mg,r
[cf.
§0]
is
smooth,
proper,
and
geometrically
connected
over
Z.
(ii)
Although
we
have
formulated
Theorem
4.1,
(i),
in
terms
of
outer
automorphisms,
it
is
a
routine
exercise
—
in
light
of
the
observation
of
(i)
—
to
reformulate
Theorem
4.1,
(i),
in
terms
of
outer
isomorphisms,
as
is
often
of
interest
in
applications
to
anabelian
geometry.
Remark
4.1.5.
In
[7],
a
group-theoretic
construction
is
given
for
the
geometrically
pro-l
arithmetic
fundamental
groups
of
conﬁguration
spaces
of
arbitrary
dimension
from
the
geometrically
pro-l
arithmetic
fundamental
group
of
a
proper
hyperbolic
curve
over
a
ﬁnite
ﬁeld.
This
construction
is
performed
by
considering
various
Lie
versions
of
these
arithmetic
fundamental
groups
of
conﬁguration
spaces
of
arbitrary
dimension.
On
the
other
hand,
by
applying
the
injectivity
portion
of
Theorem
4.1,
out
(i)
[cf.
the
argument
involving
“

”
given
in
the
proof
of
Theorem
4.1,
(ii)],
one
may
simplify
the
argument
of
[7]:
That
is
to
say,
instead
of
working
with
Lie
versions
of
geometrically
pro-l
arithmetic
fundamental
groups
of
conﬁguration
spaces
of
arbitrary
dimension
[associated
to
a
proper
hyperbolic
curve
over
a
ﬁnite
ﬁeld],
one
may
instead
restrict
oneself
to
working
with
Lie
versions
of
geometrically
pro-l
arithmetic
fundamental
groups
of
two-dimensional
conﬁguration
spaces
[associated
to
a
[not
necessarily
proper]
hyperbolic
curve
over
a
ﬁnite
ﬁeld].
[We
leave
the
routine
details
to
the
interested
reader.]
This
reduction
to
the
case
of
Lie
algebras
associated
to
two-dimensional
conﬁguration
spaces
results
in
a
substantial
reduction
of
the
book-keeping
involved.
The
following
result
allows
one
to
relate
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
to
the
work
of
Nakamura
and
Harbater-Schneps
[cf.
[26],
[5]].

is
injective
if
n

and
bijective
if
n

Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
When
n
=
1,
assertion
(i)
follows
immediately
from
Deﬁnitions
1.1,
(vi);
1.11,
(i).
Thus,
we
may
assume
that
n
≥
2.
Then
the
fact
that
OutFC
(Πn
)S
=
OutFCS
(Πn
)
follows
formally
from
Corollary
1.14,
(i);
Theorem
4.1,
(i),
(iv).
The
fact
that
OutFCS
(Πn
)
⊆
OutFC
(Πn
)+
follows
from
Corollary
1.14,
(iv).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Now
the
injectivity
portion
of
assertion
(ii)
follows
from
the
injectivity
portion
of
Theorem
4.1,
(i);
in
light
of
this
injectivity,
the
bijectivity
portion
of
assertion
(ii)
follows
from
assertion
(i)
and
Theorem
4.1,
(ii)
[cf.
the
subset
of
(a)].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii)
and
hence
of
Corollary
4.2.
Remark
4.2.1.
(i)
Suppose
that
we
are
in
the
situation
of
Corollary
4.2,
and
that
Σ
is
the
set
of
all
prime
numbers.
Then
various
injectivity
and
bijectivity
results
are
obtained
by
Nakamura
and
Harbater-Schneps
in
[26],
[5]
concerning
the
subgroup
Outn+3
⊆
Out(Πn
)
[where
n
≥
1].
This
subgroup
is
deﬁned
in
[5],
§0.1,
Deﬁnition,
by
means
of
two
conditions
“(i)”
[i.e.,
“quasi-speciality”],
“(ii)”
[i.e.,
“symmetry”].
From
the
point
of
view
of
the
theory
of
the
present
paper,
these
two
conditions
amount
to
the
condition
on
α
∈
Out(Πn
)
that
“α
∈
OutQS
(Πn
),
and,
moreover,
α
commutes
with
all
of
the
outer
symmetry
permutations”
—
i.e.,
Outn+3
=
OutFCS
(Πn
)
[cf.
Proposition
1.3,
(vii)].
(ii)
In
[5],
it
is
shown
that
the
natural

Outn+3

is
injective
if
n
≥
2
and
bijective
if
n
≥
3
[cf.
[5],
§0.1,
Corollary].
The
injectivity
portion
of
this
result
of
[5]
is
derived
[cf.
[5],
Proposition
8]
from
the
injectivity
obtained
in
[26],
Lemma
3.2.2,
and
may
be
regarded
as
a
proﬁnite
version
of
an
earlier
pro-l
result
due
to
Ihara
[cf.
[8]]
—
cf.
the
discussion
of
[5],
§0.2.
On
the
other
hand,
unlike
the
case
with
[5],
the
approach
of
[8]
allows
one
to
treat,
in
essence,
the
full
group
OutQS
(Πn
)
[i.e.,
not
just
OutFCS
(Πn
)
=
Outn+3
]
in
the
pro-l
case.
In
light
of
the
discussion
of
(i),
the
proofs
given
in
the
present
paper
of
Theorem
4.1,
(i),
and
Corollary
4.2,
(ii),
may
be
regarded
as
alternate
proofs
of
these
results
of
[8]
and
[5].
(iii)
The
strong
symmetry
assumption
imposed
on
elements
of
OutFCS
(Πn
)
suggests
that
there
is
a
substantial
gap
between
injectivity
or
bijectivity
results
for
OutFCS
(Πn
)
and
injectivity
or
bijectivity
results
for
OutFC
(Πn
).
This
gap
accounts
for
the
lack
of
the
need
to
invoke
such
results
as
the
“combinatorial
version
of
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture”
[i.e.,
[20],

2.7,
(iii)]
in
the
proofs
of

[5].
Section
5:
The
Discrete
Case
In
the
present
§5,
we
discuss
a
discrete
analogue
[cf.
Corollary
5.1]
of
Theorem
4.1.
One
important
aspect
of
this
discrete
analogue
is
that
it
is
a
relatively
easy
consequence
of
the
well-known
theorem
of
Dehn-Nielsen-Baer
[cf.,
e.g.,
[13],
Theorem
2.9.B],
together
with
the
injectivity
asserted
in
Theorem
4.1,
(i),
that
the
discrete
analogue
of
the
homomorphism
of
Theorem
4.1,
(i),
is
surjective.
In
the
following,
we
use
the
notation
“π1top
(−)”
to
denote
the
[usual]
topological
fundamental
group
of
the
connected
topological
space
in
parentheses.

such
that

Then
α
induces
a

of

for

≥

Now
let
us
consider
assertion
(i).
The
fact
that
Πn
is
residually
ﬁnite
is
well-known
[cf.,
e.g.,
[24],
Proposition
7.1,
(ii)].
Thus,
it
remains
to
verify
the

n
).
When
n
=
1,
injectivity
of
the
natural
homomorphism
OutF
(Πn
)
→
OutF
(Π

1
)
is
the
content
the
injectivity
of
the
natural
homomorphism
Out(Π1
)
→
Out(Π
of
[2],
Lemma
3.2.1,
when
X
is
non-compact;
when
X
is
compact,
the
injectivity
of
this
homomorphism
is
implicit
in
the
proofs
of
[4],
Theorems
1,
3.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i)
when
n
=
1.
Now
“assertion
(i)
for
arbitrary
n”
follows
by
applying
induction
on
n,
together
with
the
natural
isomorphism
∼
out
Πn
→
K
1

Π1
[cf.
§0;
Remark
1.1.1]
and
the
evident
discrete
analogue
of
the
interpretation
of
Πn/1
=
K1
given
in
[24],
Proposition
2.4,
(i),
which
allows
one
to
apply
the
induction
hypothesis
to
K1
[as
well
as
to
Π1
].
Indeed,
if
α
∈
AutF
(Πn
)
induces
an

n
,
then
the
automorphism
α1
∈
AutF
(Π1
)
determined
inner
automorphism
of
Π

1
.
Thus,
by
the
induction
hypothesis,
by
α
induces
an
inner
automorphism
of
Π
α1
is
inner,
so
by
replacing
α
with
the
composite
of
α
with
an
appropriate
inner
automorphism,
we
may
assume
that
α1
is
the
identity.
Then
α
induces
an
automorphism
αK
∈
AutF
(K1
)
which
is
compatible
with
the
outer
action
of
Π1
on
K1
.

n
]
from
conjugation
Moreover,
αK
arises
[relative
to
the
inclusion
K1
⊆
Πn
→
Π

n
whose
image
in
Π

1
induces
[by
conjugation]
the
identity
by
an
element
γ
∈
Π

1
),
hence
also
the
identity
automorphism
of
Π

1
.
Since
automorphism
of
Π1
(→
Π

1
is
center-free
[cf.
Remark
1.1.1],
we
thus
conclude
that
γ
lies
in
the
closure
of
Π

n
[which
is
naturally
isomorphic
to
the
proﬁnite
completion
the
image
of
K1
in
Π
of
K1
—
cf.
[24],
Proposition
7.1,
(i);
[24],
Proposition
2.2,
(i)].
Thus,
by
applying
the
induction
hypothesis
to
K1
,
we
conclude
that
αK
is
inner,
hence
[by
applying
∼
out
the
natural
isomorphism
Πn
→
K1

Π1
]
that
α
is
inner.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
First,
let
us
recall
that
by
the
well-known
theorem
of
Dehn-Nielsen-Baer
[cf.,
e.g.,
[13],
Theorem
2.9.B]
every
automorphism
α
∈
AutFC
(Π1
)
arises
from
a
homeomorphism
[or
even
a
diﬀeomorphism!]
αX
:
∼
∼
X
→
X
.
Since
αX
then
induces
a
homeomorphism
Xn
→
Xn
for
every
n
≥
1,
we
thus
obtain
elements
αn
∈
Aut(Πn
)
that
[as
is
easily
veriﬁed]
belong
to
AutFC
(Πn
)
and
lift
α
[relative,
say,
to
the
projection
Πn

Π1
determined
by
the
factor
labeled
1].
In
particular,
the
corresponding
natural
homomorphisms
OutFC
(Πn
)
→
OutFC
(Π1
)
are
surjective
for
n
≥
1.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
the
injectivity
of
OutFC
(Πn
)

[cf.
asn

follows
formally
from
the
injectivity
of
OutFC
(Πn
)
→
OutFC
(Π
sertion
(i)]
and
the
injectivity
of
Theorem
4.1,
(i).
In
light
of
the
surjectivity
of
OutFC
(Πn
)
→
OutFC
(Π1
),
we
thus
conclude
that
if
X
is
non-compact
[so
n0
=
2],
then
OutFC
(Πn
)
→
OutFC
(Πn−1
)
is
bijective
for
n
≥
2.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii)
for
non-compact
X
.
Next,
let
us
consider
the
case
where
X
is
compact.
Then
one
may
verify
the
surjectivity
of
OutFC
(Πn
)
→
OutFC
(Πn−1
)
for
n
≥
3
by
arguing
as
follows.
Let
COMBINATORIAL

β
∈
AutFC
(Πn−1
),
where
we
think
of
Πn−1
as
“Πn
/Πn/n−1
=
Πn
/Kn−1
”.
Then
β
determines
automorphisms
βK
∈
AutFC
(K1
/Kn−1
),
β1
∈
AutFC
(Π1
)
[where
we
think
of
Π1
as
“Πn
/Πn/1
=
Πn
/K1
”]
which
are
compatible
with
the
natural
outer
action
of
Π1
on
K1
/Kn−1
.
Then
by
applying
assertion
(ii)
in
the
non-compact
case
[whose
proof
has
already
been
completed]
to
K1
,
we
conclude
that
OutFC
(K1
)
→
OutFC
(K1
/Kn−1
)
is
bijective.
Let
αK
∈
AutFC
(K1
)
be
a
lifting
of
βK
.
Note
that
the
injectivity
of
OutFC
(K1
)
→
OutFC
(K1
/Kn−1
)
[together
with
the
compatibility
of
β1
,
βK
with
the
natural
outer
action
of
Π1
on
K1
/Kn−1
]
implies
that
β1
,
αK
are
compatible
with
the
natural
outer
action
of
Π1
on
K1
.
Thus,
by
applying
the
∼
out
natural
isomorphism
Πn
→
K1

Π1
[cf.
§0;
Remark
1.1.1],
we
conclude
that
αK
,
β1
determine
an
automorphism
α
∈
Aut(Πn
)
which
[as
is
easily
veriﬁed,
in
light
of
the
residual
ﬁniteness
of
assertion
(i),
by
applying
Proposition
1.2,
(i),

n
]
belongs
to
AutFC
(Πn
).
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
surjectivity
of
(iii),
to
Π
FC
Out
(Πn
)
→
OutFC
(Πn−1
)
for
n
≥
3,
and
hence
of
assertion
(ii).
The
proof
of
assertion
(iii)
as
a
consequence
of
assertion
(ii)
is
entirely
similar
to
the
proof
of
Theorem
4.1,
(iii)
[as
a
consequence
of
Theorem
4.1,
(i)].
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iv).
When
r
=
0
and
n
=
2,
assertion
(iv)
follows
immediately
from
the
evident
discrete
analogue
of
Proposition
1.6,
(i),
(a).
Thus,
it
remains
to
verify
that
OutFC
(Πn
)
⊆
Out(Πn
)
commutes
with
the
image
of
Sn
when
n
≥
n0
.
To
this
end,
let
σ
∈
Out(Πn
)
be
an
element
of
the
image
of
Sn
;
α
∈
OutFC
(Πn
);
def
ασ
=
σ
·
α
·
σ
−1
∈
Out(Πn
).
Then
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
ασ
∈
OutF
(Πn
).

n
)
coincide.
Moreover,
by
Theorem
4.1,
(iv),
the
images
of
α
and
ασ
in
OutF
(Π

n)
Thus,
the
fact
that
α
=
ασ
follows
from
the
injectivity
of
OutF
(Πn
)
→
OutF
(Π
[cf.
assertion
(i)].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iv).
Remark
5.1.1.
There
is
a
partial
overlap
between
the
content
of
Corollary
5.1
above
and
Theorems
1,
2
of
[12].
Deﬁnition
5.2.
Let
n
≥
2
be
an
integer.
(i)
Write
R
for
the
underlying
topological
space
of
the
topological
ﬁeld
of
real
numbers;
γ2
⊆
R2
=
R
×
R
for
the
unit
circle;
γn
⊆
Rn
=
R
×
.
.
.
×
R
[i.e.,
the
product
of
n
copies
of
R]
for
the
image
of
the
embedding
γ2
⊆
R2
→
Rn
obtained
by
taking
the
ﬁrst
n
−
2
coordinates
to
be
zero.
(ii)
Let
N
be
a
connected
topological
manifold
of
dimension
n;
M
⊆
N
a
def
connected
submanifold
of
dimension
n
−
2;
P
=
N
\M.
Thus,
for
each
point
x
∈
M,
there
exists
an
open
neighborhood
U
⊆
N
of
x
in
U,
together
with
an
open
x
to
the
origin
of
Rn
,
contains
γn
in
its
image,
and
immersion
U
→
Rn
that
maps

induces
an
open
immersion
U
M
→
Rn−2
(⊆
Rn
)
[where
we
think
of
Rn−2
as
the
subspace
of
Rn
whose
last
two
coordinates
are
zero].
In
particular,
we
obtain
an
immersion
γn
→
P
⊆
N

)
→

induced
by
this
immersion
γn
→
P
(⊆

).
One
veriﬁes
easily
that
IM
is
well-deﬁned
up
to
π1top
(P)conjugacy
and
independent
of
the
choice
of
x,
U,
and
the
open
immersion
U

.
We
shall
refer
to
IM
as
the
inertia
group
associated
to
M
in

(P).
Corollary
5.3.
(Quasi-Speciality)
In
the
situation
of
Corollary
5.1:
Suppose
that
X
is
obtained
as
the
complement
of
r
points
—
i.e.,
“cusps”
—
of
a
compact
oriented
topological
surface
Z.
Write
Pn
for
the
product
Z
×
.
.
.
×
Z
of
n
copies
of
Z;
D∗n
for
the
set
of

submanifolds
of

of
Pn
given
by
the

n(n

diagonals
and
the

of

via
the

maps
Pn

For

Write

Xn

[where
we
note
that

\(δ
OutQS
(Πn

⊆
Out(Πn
)
—
where
“QS”
stands
for
“quasi-special”
[cf.
Proposition
1.3,
(vii)]
—
for
the
subgroup
of
outer
automorphisms
that
stabilize
the
conjugacy
class
of
each
inertia
group
Iδ
,
for
δ
∈
Dn∗
;
OutFC
(Πn
)cusp
⊆
OutFC
(Πn
)
for
the
subgroup
of
outer
automorphisms
that
induce,
via
the
surjection
Πn

Π1
obtained
by
“forgetting
the
factors
with
labels
>
1”,
outer
automorphisms
of
Π1
that
stabilize
each
of
the
conjugacy
classes
of
the
inertia
groups
of
the
cusps.
Then:
(i)
We
have:
OutQS
(Πn
)
=
OutFC
(Πn
)cusp
.
(ii)
The
natural
homomorphism
of
Corollary
5.1,
(ii),
restricts
to
a
homomorphism
OutQS
(Πn
)
→
OutQS
(Πn−1
)
which
is
bijective
if
n
≥
n0
[where
n0
is
as
in
Corollary
5.1]
and
surjective
if
n
=
2.
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
We
begin
by
observing
that
it
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions
[together
with
well-known
facts
concerning
the
relationship
between
topological
and
étale
fundamental
groups]
that
proﬁnite
completion

n
)
⊆
OutF
(Π

n
)
[cf.
Proposition
induces
a
homomorphism
OutQS
(Πn
)
→
OutQS
(Π
1.3,
(vii)].
Thus,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
residual
ﬁniteness
of
Corollary
5.1,
(i),
that
OutQS
(Πn
)
⊆
OutF
(Πn
).
In
particular,
the
fact
that
OutQS
(Πn
)
⊆
OutFC
(Πn
)cusp
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
“OutQS
(−)”
[cf.
the
COMBINATORIAL
CUSPIDALIZATION
63
proof
of
Proposition
1.3,
(vii)].
Now
it
remains
to
verify
that
OutFC
(Πn
)cusp
⊆
OutQS
(Πn
).
To
this
end,
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
if
X
is
compact,
then
every
Iδ
[where
δ
∈
D∗n
]
lies
in
the
kernel
of
the
surjection
Πn

Π1
obtained
by
“forgetting
the
factors
with
labels
>
1”;
in
particular,
[by
thinking
of
Ker(Πn

Π1
)
as
a
“Πn−1
”
that
arises
for
some
topological
surface
of
type
(g,
1)]
we
conclude
that
it
suﬃces
to
verify
the
inclusion
OutFC
(Πn
)cusp
⊆
OutQS
(Πn
)
for
non-compact
X
.
Thus,
let
us
suppose
that
X
is
non-compact.
Then
by
Corollary
5.1,
(ii),
we
have
a
bijection
∼
OutFC
(Πn
)cusp
→
OutFC
(Π1
)cusp
—
i.e.,
[cf.
the
proof
of
Corollary
5.1,
(ii)]
every
element
α
∈
OutFC
(Πn
)cusp
∼
arises
from
a
homeomorphism
αX
:
X
→
X
.
Moreover,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
superscript
“cusp”
that
this
homeomorphism
extends
to
a
homeomorphism
∼
αZ
:
Z
→
Z
that
ﬁxes
each
of
the
cusps.
In
particular,
αZ
induces
compatible
selfhomeomorphisms
of
Xn
⊆
Xnδ
⊆
Pn
for
each
δ
∈
D∗n
.
Thus,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
α
∈
OutQS
(Πn
).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Finally,
assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
assertion
(i)
and
Corollary
5.1,
(ii).
Remark
5.3.1.
Suppose
that
(g,
r)
=
(0,
3).
Then
the
injectivity
portion
of
Corollary
5.3,
(ii),
is
[essentially]
the
content
of
[8],
§1.2,
“The
Injectivity
Theorem
(i)”.
By
applying
this
injectivity,
together
with
a
classical
result
of
Nielsen
to
the
eﬀect
that
OutQS
(Π1
)
=
{±1}
[cf.
[8],
§6.1;
here,
the
element
of
OutQS
(Π1
)
corresponding
to
“−1”
is
the
automorphism
induced
by
complex
conjugation],
one
obtains
that
OutQS
(Πn
)
=
{±1}
for
all
n
≥
2
[cf.
[8],
§1.2,
“The
Vanishing
Theorem”].
