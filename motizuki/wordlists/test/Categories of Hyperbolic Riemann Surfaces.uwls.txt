In
this
paper,
we
consider
various
categories
of
hyperbolic
Riemann
surfaces
and
show,
in
various
cases,
that
the
conformal
or
quasiconformal
structure
of
the
Riemann
surface
may
be
reconstructed,
up
to
possible
confusion
between
holomorphic
and
anti-holomorphic
structures,
in
a
natural
way
from
such
a
category.
The
theory
exposed
in
the
present
paper
is
motivated
partly
by
a
classical
result
concerning
the
categorical
representation
of
sober
topological
spaces,
partly
by
previous
work
of
the
author
concerning
the
categorical
representation
of
arithmetic
log
schemes,
and
partly
by
a
certain
analogy
with
p-adic
anabelian
geometry
—
an
analogy
which
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
serves
to
render
more
explicit.

Introduction
In
this
paper,
we
continue
our
study
[cf.,
[Mzk2],
[Mzk10]]
of
the
topic
of
representing
various
objects
that
appear
in
conventional
arithmetic
geometry
by
means
of
categories.
As
discussed
in
[Mzk2],
[Mzk10],
this
point
of
view
is
partially
motivated
by
the
anabelian
philosophy
of
Grothendieck
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk3],
[Mzk4],
[Mzk5]],
and,
in
particular,
by
the
more
recent
work
of
the
author
on
absolute
anabelian
geometry
[cf.
[Mzk6],
[Mzk7],
[Mzk8],
[Mzk9],
[Mzk11],
[Mzk12]].
One
way
to
think
about
anabelian
geometry
is
that
it
concerns
the
issue
of
representing
schemes
by
means
of
categories
[i.e.,
Galois
categories]
that
capture
certain
aspects
of
the
[étale]
topology
of
the
scheme
[i.e.,
its
fundamental
group].
From
this
point
of
view,
another

albeit
elementary,

SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
of
representing
a
“space”
by
means
of
a
“category
of
topological
origin”
is
the
wellknown
example
of
the
category
of
open
subsets
of
a
sober
topological
space
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk2],
Theorem
1.4;
[Mzk10],
Proposition
4.1].
In
some
sense,
this
example
is
the
example
that
motivated
the
construction
of
the
categories
appearing
in
the
present
paper.
The
main
results
of
this
paper
may
be
summarized
as
follows:
(1)
The
holomorphic
structure
of
a
hyperbolic
Riemann
surface
of
ﬁnite
type
may
be
reconstructed,
up
to
possible
confusion
with
the
corresponding
anti-holomorphic
structure,
from
a
certain
category
of
localizations
of
the
Riemann
surface
that
includes
the
upper
half-plane
uniformization
of
the
Riemann
surface,
together
with
its
natural
P
SL2
(R)-action
[cf.
Theorem
1.12].
(2)
Given
a
hyperbolic
Riemann
surface
of
ﬁnite
type
equipped
with
a
nonzero
logarithmic
square
diﬀerential,
one
may
deﬁne
certain
categories
of
parallelograms,
rectangles,
or
squares
associated
to
this
data.
Then
[isomorphism
classes
of]
equivalences
between
corresponding
categories
of
parallelograms
(respectively,
rectangles;
squares)
are
in
natural
bijective
correspondence
with
[quasiconformal]
Teichmüller
mappings
(respectively,
conformal
mappings)
between
such
Riemann
surfaces
equipped
with
differentials,
again
up
to
possible
confusion
between
holomorphic
and
antiholomorphic
structures
[cf.
Theorem
2.3].
Here,
we
note
that
the
categories
of
(2)
are
especially
close
to
the
“categories
of
open
subsets
of
a
sober
topological
space”
referred
to
above
—
i.e.,
roughly
speaking,
instead
of
considering
all
the
open
subsets
of
the
Riemann
surface,
one
restricts
oneself
to
those
which
are
“parallelograms”
(or,
alternatively,
“rectangles”,
or
“squares”),
in
a
sense
determined
by
the
natural
parameters
[i.e.,
of
Teichmüller
theory
—
cf.,
e.g.,
[Lehto],
Chapter
IV,
§6.1]
associated
to
the
given
square
diﬀerential.
On
the
other
hand,
from
another
point
of
view,
the
main
motivation
for
the
results
obtained
in
this
paper
came
from
the
analogy
with
p-adic
anabelian
geometry.
This
analogy
has
been
pointed
out
previously
by
the
author
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk1],
Introduction,
§0.10;
[Mzk5],
§3].
In
some
sense,
however,
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
allows
one
to
make
this
analogy
more
explicit.
Indeed,
at
the
level
of
“objects
under
consideration”
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
suggests
a
certain
“dictionary”,
as
summarized
in
Table
1
below.
The
ﬁrst
two
non-italicized
rows
of
Table
1
are
motivated
by
the
fact
that
the
datum
of
a
nonzero
logarithmic
square
diﬀerential
may
be
thought
of,
in
the
context
of
Teichmüller
theory,
as
the
datum
of
a
geodesic
in
Teichmüller
space.
In
particular,
if
one
thinks
of
oneself
as
only
knowing
the
diﬀerential
up
to
a
nonzero
complex
multiple
[cf.
Theorem
2.3],
then
one
is,
in
essence,
working
with
a
“complex
Teichmüller
geodesic”.
Moreover,
just
as
such
a
“complex
geodesic”
is
of
“holomorphic
dimension”
one
and
“real/topological
dimension”
two,
the
spectrum
of
the
ring
of
integers
of
a
p-adic
local
ﬁeld
K
is
of
algebraic
dimension
one,
while
the
absolute
Galois
group
GK
of
the
p-adic
local
ﬁeld
K
is
of
cohomological
dimension
two.
This

observation
also
motivates
the
point
of
view
of
the
third
non-italicized
row
of
Table
1,
which
is
also
discussed
in
[Mzk1],
Introduction,
§0.10.
From
the
point
of
view
of
this
third
non-italicized
row
of
Table
1,
the
conformal
structure
may
be
thought
of
as
the
metric,
or
“angular”,
structure
of
the
S1
acting
by
rotations
locally
on
the
surface.
On
the
other
hand,
from
the
point
of
view
of
p-adic
anabelian
geometry,
one
may
completely
recover
the
algebraic
structure
of
the
p-adic
curve
in
question
[cf.
the
main
result
of
[Mzk4]],
so
long
as
one
restricts
oneself
to
working
with
geometric
isomorphisms
[i.e.,
isomorphisms
arising
from
isomorphisms
of
ﬁelds]
of
the
absolute
Galois
groups
of
the
p-adic
local
ﬁelds
in
question.
Moreover,
as
one
sees
from
the
theory
of
[Mzk3],
this
geometricity
condition
corresponds
to
the
preser×
vation
of
the
metric
structure
of
the
copy
of

Dictionary
of

This
“dictionary
of
objects
under
consideration”
then
suggests
a
“dictionary
of
results”,
as
summarized
in
Table
2
below.
The
analogy
between
the
“p-adic
Teichmüller
theory”
of
[Mzk1]
[and,
in
particular,
the
canonical
representation
constructed
in
this
theory]
and
the
upper
half-plane
uniformization
of
a
hyperbolic
Riemann
surface
of
ﬁnite
type
is
one
of
the
cornerstones
of
the
theory
of
[Mzk1];
in
particular,
a
lengthy
discussion
of
this
analogy
may
be
found
in
the
Introduction
to
[Mzk1].
Also,
relative
to
the
issue
of
“reconstructing
the
original
hyperbolic
curve
or
Riemann
surface”,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
just
as
Theorem
1.12
does
not
require
the
datum
of
a
logarithmic
square
diﬀerential,
the
absoluteness
of
canonical
liftings
[cf.
[Mzk7],
Theorem
3.6]
only
involves
the
datum
of
the
logarithmic
special
ﬁber
—
i.e.,
there
is
no
“choice”
of
a
p-adic
lifting
involved
[just
as
there
is
no
“choice”
of
a
complex
Teichmüller
geodesic
in
Theorem
1.12].
By
contrast,
just
as
the
results
on
the
left-hand
side
of
the
second
and
third
non-italicized
rows
of
Table
2
do
involve
the
choice
of
such
a
complex
Teichmüller
geodesic,
the
hyperbolic
4

MOCHIZUKI
curves
involved
on
the
right-hand
side
of
the
second
and
third
non-italicized
rows
of
Table
2
require
the
choice
of
a
p-adic
lifting
of
the
logarithmic
special
ﬁber.
As
suggested
by
the
dictionary
of
Table
1,
the
“preservation
of
the
metric
structure
×
⊆
Gab
of
the
units”
[i.e.,
S1
⊆
C×
or
OK
K
]
corresponds
to
complete
reconstruction
of
the
conformal
structure
of
the
Riemann
surface
or
the
algebraic
structure
of
the
p-adic
curve
in
the
second
and
third
non-italicized
rows
of
Table
2.
On
the
other
hand,
reconstruction
of
the
quasiconformal
structure
of
the
Riemann
surface
[essentially
a
topological
invariant]
corresponds,
in
the
ﬁnal
row
of
Table
2,
to
the
reconstruction
of
the
dual
semi-graph
[also
essentially
a
topological
invariant]
of
the
logarithmic
special
ﬁber,
in
the
absence
of
the
“preservation
of
the
metric
structure
of
the
units”.
Also,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
theory
of
the
ﬁrst
non-italicized
row
of
Table
2
is
not
functorial
with
respect
to
ramiﬁed
coverings
of
the
Riemann
surface/non-admissible
coverings
of
the
p-adic
hyperbolic
curve,
whereas
the
theory
of
the
latter
three
non-italicized
rows
of
Table
2
is
functorial
with
respect
to
such
coverings.

there

if
there
exists
an

that

if

quasi-connected.
If

of
a

C
is
quasi-connected,
then
we
shall

a

of
quasi-connected
objects.
We
shall
say
that
a

epimorphic

is
an
epimorphism.
We

that
C
is
of

(respectively,
countably)
connected
type
if
it
is
closed
under

of

every

is

for

If

then
every

in

a

only
if
it

an

it

every

If

a

then
we
shall
write
C

from

by
taking
arbitrary
“formal”

is
a

(respectively,

Note
that

deﬁne

there

if
D
(respectively,

is
a

If
C

Section
1:
Reconstruction
via
the
Upper
Half-Plane
Uniformization
In
this
Section,
we
show
that
the
conformal
structure
of
a
hyperbolic
Riemann
surface
may
be
functorially
reconstructed
—
by
applying
the
well-known
geometry
of
the
upper
half-plane
uniformization
of
the
Riemann
surface
—
from
a
certain
category
of
localizations
naturally
associated
to
the
Riemann
surface.
These
categories
of
localizations
are
intended
to
be
reminiscent
of
—
i.e.,
a
sort
of
archimedean
analogue
of
—
the
categories
of
localizations
of
[Mzk11],
§4.
In
the
following
discussion,
we
shall
denote
the
[Riemann
surface
constituted
by
the]
upper
half-plane
by
the
notation
H.
Next,
we
introduce
some
terminology:
Deﬁnition
1.1.
(i)
We
shall
refer
to
a
smooth
Hausdorﬀ
complex
analytic
stack
which
admits
an
open
dense
subset
isomorphic
to
a
complex
manifold
and
[for
simplicity]
whose
universal
covering
is
a
complex
manifold
as
a
complex
orbifold.
(ii)
We
shall
refer
to
a
one-dimensional
complex
orbifold
with
at
most
countably
many
connected
components
as
a
Riemann
orbisurface.
We
shall
refer
to
a
Riemann
orbisurface
which
is
a
complex
manifold
[i.e.,
whose
“orbifold
structure”
is
trivial]
as
a
Riemann
surface.
(iii)
We
shall
refer
to
a
Riemann
orbisurface
as
being
of
ﬁnite
type
(respectively,
of
almost
ﬁnite
type)
if
it
may
be
obtained
as
the
complement
of
a
ﬁnite
subset
(respectively,
[possibly
inﬁnite]
discrete
subset)
in
a
compact
Riemann
orbisurface
(respectively,
a
Riemann
orbisurface
of
ﬁnite
type).
(iv)
We
shall
refer
to
a
connected
Riemann
orbisurface
X
(respectively,
arbitrary
Riemann
orbisurface
X)
as
being
an
H-domain
if
there
exists
a
ﬁnite
[i.e.,
proper],
surjective
étale
covering
X

→
X
such
that
X

admits
an
étale
[i.e.,
with
derivative
everywhere
nonzero]
holomorphic
map
X

→
H
(respectively,
if
every
connected
component
of
X
is
an
H-domain).
(v)
We
shall
refer
to
as
an
RC-orbifold
[i.e.,
“real
complex
orbifold”]
a
pair
X
=
(X,
ιX
),
where
X
is
a
complex
orbifold,
and
ιX
is
an
anti-holomorphic
involution
[i.e.,
automorphism
of
order
2];
we
shall
refer
to
X
as
the
complexiﬁcation
of
the
RC-orbifold
X
∗
[cf.
Remark
1.3.1
below].
Moreover,
we
shall
append
the
preﬁx
“RC-”
to
the
beginning
of
any
of
the
terms
introduced
in
(i)
–
(iv)
to
refer
to
RC-orbifolds
X
∗
=
(X,
ιX
)
for
which
X
satisﬁes
the
conditions
of
the
term
in
question.
∗
(vi)
An
RC-holomorphic
map
X→Y
between
complex
orbifolds
X,
Y
is
a
map
which
is
either
holomorphic
or
antiholomorphic
at
each
point
of
X.

between

—
where
X
∗
is
connected
[i.e.,
ιX
acts
transitively
on
the
set
of
connected
components
of
X]
—
is
an
equivalence
class
of
RC-holomorphic
maps
X
→
Y
compatible
with
ιX
,
ιY
,
where
we
consider
two
RC-holomorphic
maps
equivalent
if
they
diﬀer
by
composition
with
ιX
[or,
equivalently,
ιY
].
A
morphism
between
RC-orbifolds
X

ιX

Y

=
(Y,

—
where
X
∗
is
not
necessarily

—
is
the
datum
of
a
morphism
of
RCorbifolds
from
each
connected
component
of
X
∗
to
Y
∗
.
Remark
1.1.1.
Note
that
a
Riemann
orbisurface
of
ﬁnite
type
admits
a
unique
algebraic
structure
over
C.
We
refer
to
Lemma
1.3,
(iii),
for
the
“RC”
analogue
of
this
statement.
Remark
1.1.2.
If
X
is
an
H-domain,
and
Y
→
X
is
an
étale
morphism
of
complex
orbifolds,
then
it
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
Y
is
also
an
H-domain.
Remark
1.1.3.
If
Y
→
X
is
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
connected
Riemann
orbisurfaces,
then
the
“symmetric
functions”
in
the
various
conjugates
[i.e.,
with
respect
to
the
ﬁnite
covering
Y
→
X]
of
any
bounded
holomorphic
function
on
Y
[e.g.,
a
function
arising
from
a
morphism
Y
→
H]
give
rise
to
various
bounded
holomorphic
functions
on
X
which
determine,
up
to
a
ﬁnite
indeterminacy,
the
original
bounded
holomorphic
function
on
Y
.
Remark
1.1.4.
For
any
morphism
of
RC-orbifolds
Φ
:
X
∗
=
(X,
ιX
)
→
Y
∗
=
(Y,
ιY
)
there
exists
a
unique
holomorphic
map
φ
:
X
→
Y
lying
in
the
equivalence
class
that
constitutes
Φ.
Indeed,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
X
∗
is
connected.
Then
if
φ1
:
X
→
Y
is
any
RC-holomorphic
map
lying
in
Φ,
then
[since
X
∗
—
but
not
necessarily
X!
—
is
connected]
φ1
is
either
holomorphic
or
antiholomorphic.
If
φ1
is
holomorphic
(respectively,
anti-holomorphic),
then
we
take
def
def
φ
=
φ1
(respectively,
φ

Let

Let

from

Lemma
1.3.
(Removable
Singularities)
(i)
No
H-domain
is
a
Riemann
orbisurface
of
almost
ﬁnite
type.
(ii)
A
connected
H-domain
is
necessarily
hyperbolic
[i.e.,
its
universal
covering
is
biholomorphic
to
H].
(iii)
Any
ﬁnite
étale
RC-holomorphic
map
X
→
Y
between
Riemann
orbisurfaces
X,
Y
of
ﬁnite
type
[each
of
which,
by
Remark
1.1.1,
admits
a
unique
algebraic
structure
over
C]
is
necessarily
algebraic
over
R.
In
particular,
every
RC-Riemann
orbisurface
of
ﬁnite
type
admits
a
unique
algebraic
structure
over
R.
Proof.
Assertion
(i)
follows
immediately
[cf.
Remark
1.1.3]
from
the
observation
that
every
bounded
holomorphic
function
on
a
Riemann
orbisurface
of
almost
ﬁnite
type
extends
to
a
bounded
holomorphic
function
on
a
Riemann
orbisurface
of
ﬁnite
type,
hence
to
a
bounded
holomorphic
function
on
a
compact
Riemann
orbisurface,
which
is
necessarily
constant.
Assertion
(ii)
follows
from
the
same
fact,
applied
to
the
case
where
the
Riemann
orbisurface
of
ﬁnite
type
in
question
is
the
complex
plane.
Assertion
(iii)
follows
by
observing
that
the
properness
[i.e.,
ﬁniteness]
assumption
implies
that
this
map
X
→
Y
extends
to
the
one-point
compactiﬁcations
of
X,
Y
—
which
possess
a
natural
structure
of
[the
stack-theoretic
version
of]
complex
analytic
space
[i.e.,
the
point
at
inﬁnity
may
be
singular!]
—
and
then
applying
the
well-known
fact
that
holomorphic
[hence
also
RC-holomorphic]
maps
between
algebrizable
compact
complex
analytic
spaces
are
necessarily
algebrizable.

Remark
1.3.1.
Thus,
just
as
complex
manifolds
are
an
“analytic
analogue”
of
smooth
schemes
over
C,
RC-manifolds
[i.e.,
“RC-orbifolds”
whose
stack
structure
is
trivial]
are
intended
to
be
an
analytic
analogue
of
smooth
schemes
over
R.
Relative
to
this
analogy,
the
functor
R
of
Proposition
1.2,
(i),
is
the
analogue
of
the
functor
(XC
→
C)
→
(XC
→
R)
12
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
that
maps
a
smooth
scheme
XC
over
C
to
the
underlying
R-scheme.
Similarly,
the
ﬁrst
datum
“X”
of
an
RC-complex
manifold
X
∗
=
(X,
ιX
),
is
the
analogue,
for
a
smooth
scheme
XR
over
R,
of
the
associated
smooth
C-scheme
XR
⊗R
C,
and
the
étale
double
cover
of
Proposition
1.2,
(ii),
is
the
analogue
of
the
étale
double
cover
of
smooth
R-schemes
XR
⊗R
C
→
XR
(given
by
projection
to
the
ﬁrst
factor).
Remark
1.3.2.
Note
that
it
follows
immediately
from
Lemma
1.3,
(iii),
that
every
Riemann
orbisurface
of
ﬁnite
type
X
admits
a
canonical
compactiﬁcation
by
a
compact
Riemann
orbisurface
X
⊇
X
whose
“stack
structure”
is
trivial
near
X\X.
A
similar
statement
holds
for
RC-Riemann
orbisurfaces.
Deﬁnition
1.4.
Let
X
∗
=
(X,
ιX
)
be
an
RC-orbifold.
Then:
(i)
We
shall
refer
to
the
set
X

(C)
of
points
of
X
[i.e.,
points
of
the
“coarse
complex
analytic
space”
associated
to
the
stack
X]
as
the
set
of
complex
points
of
X
∗.
(ii)
We
shall
refer
to
the
set
X
∗
(R)
⊆
X

(C)
of
complex
points
ﬁxed
by
ιX
as
the
set
of

(iii)
We
shall
refer
to
the
set
X
∗
[C]
=
X

of
ιX

of
complex
points
of
X

as
the
set
of
RC-points
of
X
∗
.
def
(iv)
We
shall
refer
to
H∗
=
R(H)
as
the
RC-upper
half-plane.
We
shall
refer
to
an
“RC-H-domain”
[i.e.,
the
“RC”
version
of
an
H-domain]
as
an
H∗
-domain.
Remark
1.4.1.
If
X
∗
=
(X,
ιX
)
is
a
connected
RC-orbifold,
then
one
veriﬁes
easily
that
X
∗
(R)
admits
a
natural
structure
of
real
analytic
orbifold
whose
real
dimension
is
equal
to
the
complex
dimension
of
X.
Let
X
∗
=
(X,
ιX
)
be
an
RC-orbifold.
Then
note
that
one
may
consider
the
notion
of
a
covering
morphism
[of
RC-orbifolds]
Y
∗
=
(Y,
ιY
)
→
(X,
ιX
)
[i.e.,
Y
→
X
is
a
covering
morphism,
in
the
usual
sense
of
algebraic
topology].
In
particular,
if
X
∗
is
connected,
then,
by
considering
universal
covering
morphisms,
we
may
deﬁne
the
fundamental
group
π1
(X
∗
)
of
the
RC-orbifold
X
∗
.
Proposition
1.5.

(i)
If
X
∗
arises
from
a
complex
orbifold,
i.e.,
X
∗
=
R(X0
)
[cf.
Proposition
∼
1.2,
(i)],
then
we
have
a
natural
isomorphism
π1
(X0
)
→
π1
(X
∗
).
In
this
case,
we
shall
say
that
X
∗
is
of
complex
type.
(ii)
If
X
is
connected,
then
we
have
a
natural
exact
sequence
1
→
π1
(X)
→
π1
(X

)
→
Gal(C/R)
→
1.
Here,
the
surjection
π1
(X

)

Gal(C/R)
corresponds
to
the
double
covering
of
Proposition
1.2,
(ii).
In
this
case,
we
shall
say
that
X
∗
is
of
real
type.
(iii)
Suppose
that
X
is
a
hyperbolic
Riemann
orbisurface.
Then
X
∗
∼
=
H∗
if
and
only
if
π1
(X
∗
)
=
{1}.
Proof.
Assertions
(i)
and
(ii),
as
well
as
the
necessity
portion
of
assertion
(iii),
are
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions.
As
for
the
suﬃciency
portion
of
(iii),
we
observe
that
the
condition
π1
(X
∗
)
=
{1}
implies,
by
assertion
(ii),
that
X
∗
arises
from
a
connected
Riemann
orbisurface
X0
.
Thus,
since
X
=
X0
X0c
is
hyperbolic,
we
conclude
[from
the
deﬁnition
of
“hyperbolic”!]
that
X0
∼
=
H,
so
X
∗
∼
=
H∗
,
as
desired.

Next,
let
us
assume

Suppose

have
been

Then
we
may
deﬁne
a

as
follows:
If
X

(X,
ιX
)
is
of
real
type
(respectively,
of
complex
type,
and
X0
⊆
X
is
a
connected
component
of
X),
then
the
objects
Y

(respectively,
Y
)
of
this
category
are
the
RC-Riemann
orbisurfaces
(respectively,
Riemann
orbisurfaces)
which
are
either
H∗
-domains
(respectively,
H-domains)
or
RC-Riemann
orbisurfaces
(respectively,
Riemann
orbisurfaces)
of
ﬁnite
type
that
appear
as
[not
necessarily
connected]
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
X

(respectively,
X0
)
that
factor
through
the
quotient
Π.
[Here,
we
recall
that
by
Lemma
1.3,
(i),
this
“either-or”
is
mutually
exclusive.]
The
morphisms
Y1∗

which
are,

and
lie
over

(respectively,

whenever
Y1∗

Y2∗

Thus,
14

(i),
[cf.

Remark
1.1.2]
the
codomain
of
any
arrow
with
domain
of
ﬁnite
type
is
also
of
ﬁnite
type.
To
keep
the
notation
and
language
simple,
even
when
X
∗
is
of
complex
type,
we
shall
regard
the
objects
and
morphisms
of
this
category
as
RC-orbifolds
and
morphisms
of
RC-orbifolds,
via
the
fully
faithful
functor
R
of
Proposition
1.2;
moreover,
thinking
about
things
in
this
way
renders
explicit
the
independence
of
LocΠ
(X
∗
)
of
the
choice
of
X0
,
as
the
notation
suggests.
Lemma
1.6.
(Basic
Categorical
Properties)
Let
φ∗
:
Y1∗
→
Y2∗
be
a
morphism
in
LocΠ
(X
∗
).
Then:
(i)
If
ψ
∗
:
Z2∗
→
Y2∗
is
a
morphism
in
LocΠ
(X
∗
),
then
the
projection
morphisms
Y1∗
×Y2∗
Z2∗
→
Z2∗
;
Y1∗
×Y2∗
Z2∗
→
Y1∗
obtained
by
forming
the
ﬁbered
product
of
Y1∗
,
Z2∗
over
Y2∗
in
the
category
of
RC-orbifolds
lie
in
LocΠ
(X
∗
).
(ii)
φ∗
is
a
monomorphism
if
and
only
if
it
factors
as
the
composite
of
an
∼
isomorphism
Y1∗
→
Y3∗
with
an
open
immersion
Y3∗
→
Y2∗
,
where
Y3∗
is
the
object
determined
by
some
open
subset
of
Y2∗
[C].
(iii)
If
Y1∗
=
∅,
and
Y2∗
is
a
connected
RC-orbifold,
then
φ∗
is
an
epimorphism.
In
particular,
the
full
subcategory
of
LocΠ
(X
∗
)
consisting
of
the
connected
objects
is
a
totally
epimorphic
category
of
quasi-connected
objects
[cf.
§0].
Proof.
Assertion
(i)
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions
if
Y1∗
and
Z2∗
are
of
ﬁnite
type;
if
either
Y1∗
or
Z2∗
is
an
H∗
-domain,
then
assertion
(i)
follows
by
applying
the
observation
of
Remark
1.1.2.
Assertion
(ii)
may
be
reduced
to
the
case
where
Y2∗
is
of
complex
type,
by
base-changing
[cf.
assertion
(i)]
via
the
double
covering
of
Proposition
1.2,
(ii)
[applied
to
Y2∗
].
When
Y2∗
is
of
complex
type,
assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions,
by
considering
various
maps
H∗
→
Y2∗
.
Finally,
assertion
(iii)
follows
from
the
elementary
complex
analysis
fact
that
a
holomorphic
function
on
a
connected
domain
which
vanishes
on
an
open
subset
is
necessarily
identically
zero.

This

an

if

if
Y

(ii)
If

[cf.
§0]
as
an

of

then

Proof.
First,
let
us
observe
the
easily
veriﬁed
—
e.g.,
by
cardinality
considerations
concerning
the
set
of
isomorphism
classes
of
objects
of

which
are

fact
that,
if
Y

is
of

then
there
exist
open
subsets
U
⊆
Y

[C]
of
the
form
Y

where
E

is
a

which
do
not
lie
in
the
essential
image
of
the
functor
of
assertion
(i)
[cf.
Lemma
1.3,

In
light
of
this
observation,
assertion
(i)
is
a
formal
consequence
of
Lemma
1.6,
(ii);
Remark
1.1.2.
Finally,
assertion
(ii)
is
an
immediate
consequence
of
the
deﬁnition
of
the

Lemma
1.8.
(Category-Theoreticity
of
the
Topological
Space
of
RC-Points)
For
i
=
1,
2,
let
Xi∗
be
a
connected
hyperbolic
RC-Riemann
orbisurface
of
ﬁnite
type;
π1
(Xi∗
)∧

Πi
a
quotient.
Let
∼
Φ
:
LocΠ1
(X1∗
)
→
LocΠ2
(X2∗
)
be
an
equivalence
of
categories;
Yi∗
∈
Ob(LocΠi
(Xi∗
));
assume
that
Y2∗
=
Φ(Y1∗
).
Then
Φ
induces
a
homeomorphism
∼
Y1∗
[C]
→
Y2∗
[C]
on
the
topological
spaces
of
RC-points
which
is
functorial
in
both
Φ
and
the
Yi∗
.
In
particular,
Y1∗
is
of
ﬁnite
type
if
and
only
if
Y2∗
=
Φ(Y1∗
)
is
of
ﬁnite
type.
Proof.
Note
that
the
inﬁnitely
mobile
objects
are
manifestly
preserved
by
Φ
and
that
H∗
is
inﬁnitely
mobile.
In
particular,
every
object
of
LocΠi
(Xi∗
)
is
covered
by
inﬁnitely
mobile
opens.
Thus,
by
functoriality
[and
an
evident
“gluing
argument”],
we
may
assume,
without
loss
of
generality,
that
the
Yi∗
are
inﬁnitely
mobile.
But
then,
since
the
topological
spaces
Yi∗
[C]
are
clearly
sober,
the
existence
of
a
functorial
homeomorphism
as
desired
[as
well
as
the
fact
that
Φ
preserves
objects
of
ﬁnite
type]
follows
from
Lemma
1.7,
(i),
(ii),
together
with
a
well-known
result
from
“topos
theory”
[i.e.,
to
the
eﬀect
that
a
sober
topological
space
may
be
recovered
from
the
category
of
sheaves
on
the
space
—
cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk2],
Theorem
1.4].

Lemma
1.9.
(Category-Theoreticity
of
the
Fundamental
Group)
For
∗
i
=
1,
2,
let
Xi
,
Πi
,
Φ,
Yi∗
be
as
in
Lemma
1.8.
Then
Φ
preserves
the
arrows
which
16
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
are
covering
morphisms.
In
particular,
Φ
preserves
isomorphs
of
H∗
and,
if
the
Yi∗
are
connected,
induces
an
isomorphism
of
groups
∼
π1
(Y1∗
)
→
π1
(Y2∗
)
—
well-deﬁned
up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
—
which
is
functorial
in
both
Φ
and
the
choices
of
universal
covering
morphism
Zi∗
→
Yi∗
used
to
deﬁne
the
π1
’s.
Proof.
Indeed,
covering
morphisms
may
be
characterized
by
the
existence
of
local
base-changes
over
which
the
given
morphism
splits
as
a
disjoint
union
of
isomorphs
of
the
base.
Thus,
the
fact
that
Φ
preserves
covering
morphisms
follows
from
Lemmas
1.6,
(i);
1.8.
The
assertion
concerning
fundamental
groups
then
follows
formally;
the
assertion
concerning
isomorphs
of
H∗
follows
from
Proposition
1.5,
(iii).

Lemma

(Category-Theoreticity
of

RC-Orbifold
Structure)
∗
For
i
=
1,
2,
let
Xi
,
Πi
,
Φ,
Yi∗
be
as
in
Lemma
1.8.
Then
Φ
induces
an
isomorphism
of

∼
Y1∗
→
Y2∗
which
is
functorial
in
both
Φ
and
the
Yi∗
and
compatible
with
the
homeomorphisms
of
Lemma
1.8.
In
particular,
X1∗
(respectively,
Y1∗
)
is
of
real
type
if
and
only
if
X2∗
(respectively,
Y2∗

is.
Proof.
Indeed,
by
functoriality,
we
may
assume,
without
loss
of
generality,
that
the
Yi∗
are
connected.
Choose
universal
coverings
Zi∗
→
Yi∗
[so
Zi∗
∼

H∗
]
which
are
compatible
with
Φ
[cf.
Lemma
1.9].
Note
that
we
have
an
exact
sequence
of
topological
groups

the

(H∗

is
that

by
the

of

on

In
particular,
Aut(Zi∗

=
AutLocΠi
(Xi∗
)
(Zi∗
)
is
connected
if
and
only
if
Xi∗
is
of
complex
type.
Moreover,
by
Lemmas

Φ

Note
that
since
Aut(Zi∗

is
a
real
analytic
Lie

we
thus
conclude
[by
Cartan’s
theorem
—
cf.,
∼
e.g.,

that
the
isomorphism

in

an

Next,
let
us
choose
maximal
connected
compact

Ki
⊆
Aut(Zi∗

which
are
compatible
with

Then
if

On
the

then
we
have

[where
the

which
are
compatible
with
Φ.
Whether
Xi∗
is
of
real
or
complex
type,
def
let
us
write
Ki0
=
Ki
Aut(Zi∗

;
Yi∗
=
(Yi
,
ιYi
).
Note
that
Yi∗
is
of
real
type
if
and
only
if
π1
(Yi∗
)
⊆
Aut(Zi∗
)
has
image
=
{1}
in
Aut(Zi∗
)/Aut(Zi∗

.
If
Yi∗
is
of
real
type,
then
π1
(Yi
)
⊆
π1
(Yi∗
)
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
kernel
of
this
map
to
Aut(Zi∗

,
and
Yi
equipped
with
its
ιYi
-action
is
naturally
isomorphic
to
Ki
\Aut(Zi∗

[where
the

equipped
with
the
natural
action
by
π1

(Yi

∼

Gal(C/R)
[from
the
right].
If
Yi∗
is
of
complex

then
Yi∗
is
naturally
isomorphic
to
the
result
of
applying
the
functor
“R”
to

Ki0
\Aut(Zi∗

/π1
(Yi∗

[where
the
“/”
is

Thus,
we
conclude
that
[for
Xi∗
of
real
or
∼
complex
type]
Φ
induces
an
isomorphism
of
RC-orbifolds
Y1∗
→
Y2∗

as
desired.
That
this
isomorphism
is
compatible
with
the
homeomorphisms
of
Lemma
1.8
follows
by
comparing
the
respective
induced
maps
on
“points”
—
where
we
note
that
in
the
context
of
Lemma
1.8
(respectively,
the
present
proof),
“points”
of,
say,
Zi∗
,
amount
to
systems
of
neighborhoods
of
an
element
of
Zi∗
[C]
(respectively,
left
cosets
of
Ki
in
Aut(Zi∗

or
of
Ki0
in
Aut(Zi∗
)0
)
—
by
considering
the
action
of
Aut(Zi∗
),
Ki
on
such
systems
of
neighborhoods.
Finally,
the
functoriality
of
the
∼
isomorphism
Y1∗
→
Y2∗
with
respect
to
Φ
(respectively,
the
Yi∗
)
is
clear
(respectively,
a
consequence
of
the
compatibility
with
the
homeomorphisms
of
Lemma
1.8).

Section
2:
Categories
of
Parallelograms,
Rectangles,
and
Squares
In
this
Section,
we
show
that
the
quasiconformal
(respectively,
conformal;
conformal)
structure
of
a
connected
hyperbolic
RC-Riemann
orbisurface
of
ﬁnite
type
may
be
functorially
reconstructed
from
a
certain
category
of
parallelogram
(respectively,
rectangle;
square)
localizations.
Although,
just
as
was
the
case
with
the
categories
of
§1,
these
categories
of
localizations
are
intended
to
be
reminiscent
of
the
categories
of
localizations
of
[Mzk11],
§4,
they
diﬀer
from
the
categories
of
§1
in
the
following
crucial
way:
They
admit
terminal
objects
[cf.
the
categories
of
[Mzk11],
§4,
which
also,
essentially,
admit
terminal
objects,
up
to
ﬁnitely
many
automorphisms,
or,
alternatively,
the
categories
called
temperoids
of
[Mzk11],
§3].
Deﬁnition
2.1.
(i)
We
shall
refer
to
a
connected
hyperbolic
Riemann
(respectively,
RC-Riemann)
orbisurface
as
a
punctured
torus
(respectively,
punctured
RC-torus)
if
it
(respectively,
each
connected
component
of
its
complexiﬁcation)
arises
as
the
complement
of
a
ﬁnite,
nonempty
subset
of
a
one-dimensional
complex
torus
[i.e.,
the
Riemann
surface
associated
to
an
elliptic
curve
over
C].
If
this
ﬁnite
subset
is
a
translate
of
a
subgroup
of
the
complex
torus
(respectively,
is
of
cardinality
one),
then
we
shall
refer
to
the
punctured
torus
(respectively,
punctured
RC-torus)
as
being
of
torsion
type
(respectively,
once-punctured).
(ii)
Let
Y
be
a
compact
connected
Riemann
orbisurface;
Y
⊆
Y
the
Riemann
orbisurface
of
ﬁnite
type
obtained
by
removing
some
ﬁnite
set
S
of
points
from
Y
.
[Thus,
by
Lemma
1.3,
(iii),
Y
is
completely
determined
by
Y
.]
Then
we
shall
refer
to
as
a
logarithmic
square
diﬀerential
on
Y
a
section
φ
over
Y
of
the
line
bundle
ωY⊗2
[where
ωY
is
the
holomorphic
line
bundle
of
diﬀerentials
on
Y
]
which
extends
to
a
section
over
Y
of
the
line
bundle
ωY⊗2
(S)
[where
ωY
is
the
holomorphic
line
bundle
of
diﬀerentials
on
Y
;
we
use
the
notation
S
to
denote
the
reduced
eﬀective
divisor
on
Y
determined
by
the
set
S].
The
noncritical
locus
Ynon
⊆
Y
of
a
logarithmic
square
diﬀerential
φ
on
Y
is
deﬁned
to
be
the
Riemann
orbisurface
of
points
at
which
φ
=
0;
the
universalization
of
a
logarithmic
square
diﬀerential
φ
on
Y
is
deﬁned
to
be
the
universal
covering
Y
non
→
Ynon
of
the
noncritical
locus
Ynon
of
φ.
As
is
well-known
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Lehto],
Chapter
IV,
§6.1],
if
φ
≡
0
[i.e.,
φ
is
not
identically
zero],
then
the
path
integral
of
the
square
root
of
φ
over
Y
non
φ
determines
a
“natural
parameter”
zφ
:
Y
non
→
C
20
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
on
Y
non
,
which
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
square
root
and
the
choice
of
a
basepoint
for
the
integral,
up
to
multiplication
by
±1
and
addition
of
a
constant.
In
particular,
it
makes
sense
to
deﬁne
a
φ-parallelogram
(respectively,
φ-rectangle;
φ-square)
of
Y
non
to
be
an
open
subset
or
Y
non
[or,
by
abuse
of
terminology,
the
associated
Riemann
surface]
that
maps
bijectively
via
zφ
onto
a
parallelogram
(respectively,
rectangle;
square)
of
C,
in
the
sense
of
Deﬁnition
A.3,
(i),
(ii),
of
the
Appendix.
We
shall
refer
to
a
φ-parallelogram
as
pre-compact
if
it
is
contained
in
a
compact
subset
of
Y
non
.
(iii)
A
logarithmic
square
diﬀerential
φ∗
on
a
connected
RC-Riemann
orbisurface
of
ﬁnite
type
X
∗
is
deﬁned
to
be
a
logarithmic
square
diﬀerential
φ
on
[each
connected
component
of]
the
complexiﬁcation
of
X
∗
which
is
preserved
by
the
antiholomorphic
involution
of
X
∗
.
Given
a
logarithmic
square
diﬀerential
φ∗
on
X
∗
,
the
noncritical
locus
(respectively,
universalization;
natural
parameters
[whenever
φ
≡
0])
associated
to
the
corresponding
logarithmic
square
diﬀerential
on
the
com∗
⊆
X
∗
(respectively,
plexiﬁcation
of
X
∗
thus
determine
a
noncritical
locus
Xnon
∗
universalization
X
∗non
→
Xnon
;
natural
parameters
zφ∗
:
X
∗non
[C]
→
C)
associated
∗
to
φ
.
Here,
any
two
natural
parameters
zφ∗
,
zφ
∗
are
related
to
one
another
as
follows:
zφ
∗
is
equal
to
either
±zφ∗
+
λ,
for
some
λ
∈
C,
or
the
complex
conjugate
of
this
expression.
In
particular,
we
obtain
a
notion
of
φ∗
-parallelograms
(respectively,
φ∗
-rectangles;
φ∗
-squares;
pre-compact
φ∗
-parallelograms)
associated
to
φ∗
[all
of
which
are
to
be
regarded
as
RC-Riemann
surfaces
over
X
∗non
].
(iv)
Let
Y
,
Z
be
Riemann
orbisurfaces
of
ﬁnite
type.
If
Y
,
Z
are
connected,
then
we
shall
refer
to
a
map
Y
→
Z
as
anti-quasiconformal
(respectively,
antiTeichmüller)
if
it
is
quasiconformal
(respectively,
a
Teichmüller
mapping
—
cf.
Remark
2.1.1
below)
with
respect
to
the
holomorphic
structure
on
Y
given
by
the
holomorphic
functions
and
the
holomorphic
structure
on
Z
given
by
the
antiholomorphic
functions.
If
Y
,
Z
are
not
necessarily
connected,
then
we
shall
refer
to
a
map
Y
→
Z
as
RC-quasiconformal
(respectively,
RC-Teichmüller)
if
its
restriction
to
each
connected
component
of
Y
determines
a
map
to
some
connected
component
of
Z
that
is
either
quasiconformal
or
anti-quasiconformal
(respectively,
either
a
Teichmüller
mapping
or
an
anti-Teichmüller
mapping).
(v)
Let
Y
∗
=
(Y,
ιY
),
Z
∗
=
(Z,
ιZ
)
be
connected
RC-Riemann
orbisurfaces
of
ﬁnite
type.
Then
we
shall
refer
to
as
an
RC-quasiconformal
morphism
(respectively,
RC-Teichmüller
morphism)
Y
∗
→
Z
∗
an
equivalence
class
of
RC-quasiconformal
(respectively,
RC-Teichmüller)
maps
Y
→
Z
compatible
with
ιY
,
ιZ
,
where
we
consider
two
such
maps
equivalent
if
they
diﬀer
by
composition
with
ιY
[or,
equivalently,
ιZ
].
If
ΠY
,
ΠZ
are
tempered
topological
groups,
and
π1
(Y
∗
)
→
ΠY
;
π1
(Z
∗
)
→
ΠZ
are
dense
[cf.
§0]
morphisms
of
tempered
[cf.
§0]
topological
groups
[i.e.,
we
think
of
π1
(Y
∗
),
π1
(Z
∗
)
as
being
equipped
with
the
discrete
topology,
so
π1
(Y
∗
),
π1
(Z
∗
)
are
tempered
topological
groups],
then
we
shall
say
that
an
RC-quasiconformal
morphism
Y
∗
→
Z
∗
is
(ΠY
,
ΠZ
)-compatible
if
there
exists
a
[necessarily
unique,
∼
by
the
“dense-ness”
assumption]
isomorphism
ΠY
→
ΠZ
that
is
compatible
[in

with
the

π1
(Y

)
→

(Z

)
induced
by
the
RC-quasiconformal
morphism
Y

→

.
(vi)
A
Teichmüller
pair
(X,
φ)
(respectively,
RC-Teichmüller
pair
(X
∗
,
φ∗
))
is
deﬁned
to
be
a
pair
consisting
of
a
connected
hyperbolic
Riemann
(respectively,
RC-Riemann)
orbisurface
of
ﬁnite
type
X
(respectively,
X
∗
)
and
a
non-identically
zero
logarithmic
square
diﬀerential
φ
(respectively,
φ∗
)
on
X
(respectively,
X
∗
).
Remark
2.1.1.
We
refer
to
[Lehto],
Chapter
V,
§7,
§8,
for
more
on
the
theory
of
Teichmüller
mappings
between
Riemann
orbisurfaces
of
ﬁnite
type.
Note
that
although
the
theory
of
Teichmüller
mappings
is
typically
only
developed
for
compact
Riemann
surfaces,
it
extends
immediately
to
the
case
of
an
arbitrary
Riemann
orbisurface
of
ﬁnite
type
Y
by
passing
to
an
appropriate
Galois
ﬁnite
étale
covering
Z
→
Y
which
extends
to
a
ramiﬁed
covering
of
compact
Riemann
orbisurfaces
Z
→
Y
,
where
Z
is
a
Riemann
surface,
and
Z
→
Y
is
ramiﬁed
at
every
point
of
Z\Z.
[Indeed,
the
ramiﬁcation
condition
implies
that
a
logarithmic
square
diﬀerential
on
Y
pulls
back
to
a
logarithmic
square
diﬀerential
on
Z
which
extends
to
a
square
diﬀerential
without
poles
on
Z.]
Remark
2.1.2.
Let
Φ
:
Y
∗
→
Z
∗
be
an
RC-quasiconformal
morphism
(respectively,
RC-Teichmüller
morphism),
as
in
Deﬁnition
2.1,
(v)
[so
Y
∗
,
Z
∗
are
connected].
Then
[cf.
Remark
1.1.4]
there
exists
a
unique
quasiconformal
map
(respectively,
Teichmüller
mapping)
φ
:
Y
→
Z
lying
in
the
equivalence
class
that
constitutes
Φ.
Remark
2.1.3.
One
important
example
of
an
RC-Teichmüller
pair
(X
∗
,
φ∗
)
is
the
case
where
X
∗
admits
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
Y
∗
→
X
∗
such
that
Y
∗
is
a
punctured
RC-torus
of
complex
type,
and
the
square
diﬀerential
φ∗
|Y
∗
extends
to
a
square
diﬀerential
on
the
canonical
compactiﬁcation
[cf.
Remark
1.3.2]
of
Y
∗
.
Note
that
in
this
case,
φ∗
is
completely
determined,
up
to
a
nonzero
constant
multiple.
In
the
following,
we
shall
refer
to
such
a
pair
as
toral.
Note
that
if
Z
∗
→
X
∗
is
also
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
X
∗
by
a
punctured
RC-torus
of
complex
type
Z
∗
such
that
φ∗
|Z
∗
extends
to
a
square
diﬀerential
on
the
canonical
compactiﬁcation
of
Z
∗
—
in
which
case
we
shall
say
that
Z
∗
→
X
∗
is
toralizing
—
then
one
veriﬁes
immediately
[by
considering
the
natural
parameters
associated
to
φ∗
]
that
there
exists
a
toralizing
ﬁnite
étale
covering
W
∗
→
X
∗
that
dominates
the
coverings
Y
∗
→
X
∗
,
Z
∗
→
X
∗
.
In
particular,
it
follows
that
there
exists
a
unique
[up
to
not
necessarily
unique
∗
→
X
∗
[i.e.,
such
that
isomorphism]
“minimal
toralizing
ﬁnite
étale
covering”
Ymin
∗
every
other
toralizing
ﬁnite
étale
covering
Y
∗
→
X
∗
factors
through
Ymin
→
X
∗
].
Let
(X
∗
=
(X,
ιX
),
φ∗
)
be
an
RC-Teichmüller
pair.
Suppose
that
we
have
been
given
a
tempered
topological
group
Π
and
a
dense
morphism
π1
(X
∗
)
→
Π
22
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
of
tempered
topological
groups.
Thus,
for
every
open
subgroup
H
⊆
Π,
the
induced
morphism
π1
(X
∗
)
→
Π/H
is
surjective.
Let
us
refer
to
a
connected
covering
of
X
∗
as
being
a
Π-covering
if
it
appears
as
a
subcovering
of
the
covering
determined
by
such
a
quotient
π1
(X
∗
)

Π/H.
In
the
following,
we
shall
also
make
the
following
two
assumptions
on
Π:
(1)
“Π
is
totally
ramiﬁed
at
inﬁnity”
in
the
sense
that
there
exist
Galois
ﬁnite
Π-coverings
of
X
∗
which
are
ramiﬁed
over
every
point
of
the
canonical
∗
compactiﬁcation
[cf.
Remark
1.3.2]
X
⊇
X
∗
which
is
not
contained
in
X
∗.
(2)
“Π
is
stack-resolving”
in
the
sense
that
there
exist
Galois
ﬁnite
Πcoverings
of
X
∗
which
are
of
complex
type
and
whose
“stack
structure”
is
trivial.
Now
we
deﬁne
the
category
of
parallelogram
(Π-)localizations
of
(X
∗
,
φ∗
)
∗
∗
LocP
Π
(X
,
φ
)
as
follows:
The
objects
Z∗
of
this
category
are
the
RC-Riemann
orbisurfaces
which
are
either
pre-compact
φ∗
-parallelograms
of
the
universalization
X
∗non
or
RC-Riemann
orbisurfaces
that
appear
as
connected
[but
not
necessarily
ﬁnite]
Π-coverings
of
X
∗
.
Objects
of
the
former
type
will
be
referred
to
as
parallelogram
objects;
objects
of
the
latter
type
will
be
referred
to
as
complete
objects.
A
parallelogram
object
deﬁned
by
a
φ∗
-rectangle
(respectively,
φ∗
-square)
will
be
referred
to
as
a
rectangle
object
(respectively,
square
object).
A
complete
object
that
arises
from
a
ﬁnite
covering
of
X
∗
will
be
referred
to
as
a
ﬁnite
object.
The
morphisms
Z1∗
→
Z2∗
of
this
category
are
arbitrary
étale
morphisms
of
RC-orbifolds
over
X
∗
which,
moreover,
satisfy
the
property
that
if
Z1∗
is
a
parallelogram
object,
then
either
the
given
arrow
Z1∗
→
Z2∗
is
an
isomorphism
of
RC-orbifolds
or
the
given
arrow
Z1∗
→
Z2∗
has
pre-compact
image
[i.e.,
the
image
of
Z1∗
[C]
lies
inside
a
compact
subset
of
Z2∗
[C]].
Similarly,
we
deﬁne
the
category
of
rectangle
(Π-)localizations
of
(X
∗
,
φ∗
)
∗
∗
LocR
Π
(X

determined
by
the

which
are
either
complete

and
the

of
(X

LocS
Π

Observe

think
of

as
being

(ii),
let
Z
∗
→
Y
∗
be
an
arrow
such
that
Z
∗
is
complete,
but
Y
∗
is
not
complete.
Thus,
Y
∗
is
a
parallelogram
object,
and
the
morphism
Z
∗
→
Y
∗
is
over
X
∗
,
hence
∗
∗
.
In
particular,
we
conclude
that
Xnon
=
X
∗
.
Note,
moreover,
that
over
Xnon
∗
∗
Z
∗
→
X
∗
is
a
covering
morphism
which
[outside
of
the
category
Loc
Π
(X
,
φ
)]
is
a
∗
∗
subcovering
of
the
covering
X
non
→
X
.
In
particular,
if
we
base-change
over
X
∗
by
X
∗non
→
X
∗
,
we
obtain
[since
Y
∗
is
simply
connected]
a
morphism
X
∗non
→
Y
∗
over
X
∗non
,
which
is
absurd
[since,
for
instance,
Y
∗
[C],
unlike
X
∗non
[C],
has
pre-compact
image
in
X
∗non
[C]].
In
light
of
assertion
(ii),
assertion
(iii)
is
immediate
from
our
∗
∗
pre-compactness
assumption
in
the
deﬁnition
of
the
morphisms
of
Loc
Π
(X
,
φ
)
with
parallelogram
domain
[together
with
the
observation
that
morphisms
between
complete
objects
are
always
covering
morphisms,
hence
are
monomorphisms
if
and
only
if
they
are
isomorphisms].
Next,
we
consider
endomorphisms
of
parallelogram
objects,
i.e.,
assertion
(vii).
First,
let
us
observe
that
pulling
back
the
standard
volume
form
on
C
via
a
natural
parameter
yields
a
volume
form
μX
non
on
X
∗non
[C]
that
is
compatible
with
the
aﬃne
linear
structure
on
X
∗non
[C]
determined
by
the
natural
parameters,
and,
moreover,
∗
∗
)
[since
automorphisms
of
Gal(X
∗non
/Xnon
)
ﬁx
φ∗
,
is
held
ﬁxed
by
Gal(X
∗non
/Xnon
hence
map
natural
parameters
associated
to
φ∗
to
natural
parameters
associated
to
∗
∗
∗
φ∗
].
In
particular,
since
all
morphisms
of
Loc
Π
(X
,
φ
)
are
over
X
,
it
follows
that
∗
μX
non
(respectively,
the
aﬃne
linear
structure
on
X
non
[C])
determines
a
volume
form
μZ
(respectively,
aﬃne
linear
structure)
on
Z
∗
[C]
that
is
compatible
with
all
endomorphisms
of
Z
∗
.
Thus,
the
fact
that
every
endomorphism
of
Z
∗
is
an
automorphism
follows
immediately
from
the
[easily
veriﬁed,
elementary]
fact
that
every
volume-preserving,
aﬃne
linear
automorphism
of
C
that
maps
a
parallelogram
of
X
non
into
itself
necessarily
induces
a
bijection
of
this
parallelogram
onto
itself.
Moreover,
it
is
immediate
[for
instance,
by
considering
the
induced
bijections
of
edges
and
vertices
of
the
closure
of
the
parallelogram]
that
the
group
of
aﬃne
linear
automorphisms
of
this
parallelogram
that
arise
in
this
fashion
is
ﬁnite.
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(viii).
First,
observe
that
any
two
morphisms
Zi∗
→
∗
∗
X
∗non
[where
i
=
1,
2]
that
arise
from
lifting
morphisms
Zi∗
→
X
∗
of
Loc
Π
(X
,
φ
)
∗
),
and
that
it
is
immediate
diﬀer
by
composition
with
an
element
of
Gal(X
∗non
/Xnon
∗
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
there
exist
such
morphisms
Zi
→
X
∗non
which
are
open
immersions.
In
particular,
it
follows
that
every
morphism
Zi∗
→
X
∗non
that
arises
∗
∗
from
lifting
a
morphism
Zi∗
→
X
∗
of
Loc
Π
(X
,
φ
),
hence,
in
particular,
every
∗
composite
Z1∗
→
Z2∗
→
X
non
of
such
a
lifted
morphism
Z2∗
→
X
∗non
with
an
∗
∗
arbitrary
morphism
Z1∗
→
Z2∗
of
Loc
Π
(X
,
φ
)
is
an
open
immersion.
Thus,
it
∗
follows
immediately
that
any
morphism
Z1
→
Z2∗
is
a
monomorphism,
as
desired.
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(ix).
First,
we
recall
that
it
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnition
of
a
“connected
temperoid”
[cf.
[Mzk11],
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(ii)]
that
any
monomorphism
between
connected
objects
of
a
connected
temperoid
is,
in
fact,
an
isomorphism.
Thus,
it
follows
from
assertion
(i)
that
Z1∗
is
a
parallelogram
object.
If
Z2∗
is
also
a
parallelogram
object,
then
it
follows
immediately
from
our
pre∗
∗
compactness
assumption
in
the
deﬁnition
of
the
morphisms
of
Loc
Π
(X
,
φ
)
with
∗
∗
parallelogram
domain
that
Z1
→
Z2
admits
a
factorization
of
the
desired
type.
If,
on
the
other
hand,
Z2∗
is
complete,
then
[as
discussed
above],
the
morphism
CATEGORIES

SURFACES
25
Z1∗
→
Z2∗
factors
as
a
composite
Z1∗
→
X
∗non
→
Z2∗
.
Now
since
the
image
of
the
morphism
Z1∗
→
X
∗non
is
[by
the
deﬁnition
of
the
“parallelogram
objects”
of
∗
∗
∗
∗
Loc
Π
(X
,
φ
)]
pre-compact,
it
follows
immediately
that
the
morphism
Z1
→
X
non
∗
factors
as
a
composite
Z1∗
→
Z3∗
→
X
non
,
where
Z1∗
→
Z3∗
is
a
non-isomorphism
of
∗
∗
∗
∗
Loc
Π
(X
,
φ
)
between
parallelogram
objects,
and
Z3
→
X
non
is
an
open
immersion.
Thus,
by
composing
the
arrow
Z3∗
→
X
∗non
with
the
arrow
X
∗non
→
Z2∗
,
we
obtain
a
factorization
Z1∗
→
Z3∗
→
Z2∗
of
the
desired
type.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ix).

Proof.
First,
let
us
observe
that
it
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
an
isomorphism
X1∗
→
X2∗
of
the
type
stated
in
assertions
(ii),
(iii),
induces
an
equivalence
of
categories
between
the
respective
categories
“Loc
”
[where

is
“P”,
“R”,
or
“S”].
[In
the
case
of
RC-Teichmüller
morphisms,
this
follows
immediately
from
the
manifestly
aﬃne
linear
explicit
local
form
of
a
Teichmüller
mapping
—
cf.,
e.g.,
[Lehto],
Chapter
V,
Theorem
8.1.]
In
particular,
we
note
that
the
deﬁnition
of
each
of
these
categories
is
unaﬀected
by
multiplying
φ∗
by
a
nonzero
complex
number.
Next,
let
us
suppose
that
we
have
been
given
an
equivalence
Φ
between
the
def
∗
∗
respective
categories
“Loc
”.
Write
C
=
Loc
Πi
(Xi
,
φi
).
Let
us
refer
to
an
ordered
set
which
is
isomorphic,
as
an
ordered
set,
to
the
set
of
natural
numbers
[equipped
with
its
usual
ordering]
as
a
naturally
ordered
set.
If
W
∗
∈
Ob(C),
then
let
us
refer
to
as
a
P-system
[i.e.,
a
“system
of
parallelograms”]
over
W
∗
a
projective
system
Z
=
{Zj∗
}j∈J
.
.
.
→
Zj∗
→
.
.
.
→
Zj∗
→
.
.
.
in
CW
∗
,
indexed
by
a
naturally
ordered
set
J,
such
that:
(a)
each
object
Zj∗
→
W
∗
of
this
system
is
an
arrow
of
C
whose
domain
Zj∗
is
a
parallelogram;
(b)
no
arrow
Zj∗
→
Zj∗
is
an
isomorphism.
Recall
from
Proposition
2.2,
(viii),
that
every
arrow
Zj∗
→
Zj∗
is
a
monomorphism.
There
is
an
evident
notion
of
morphisms
between
P
-systems
over
W
∗
[i.e.,
morphisms
of
projective
systems].
We
shall
call
a
Psystem
Z
over
W
∗
minimal
if
every
morphism
of
P
-systems
[over
W
∗
]
Z

→
Z
is
an
isomorphism.
Let
Z
=
{Zj∗
}j∈J
be
a
P-system
over
W
∗
.
Then
it
follows
from
our
precompactness
assumption
in
the
deﬁnition
of
the
morphisms
of
“Loc
”
with
parallelogram
domain
that
if
we
denote
the
closure
of
the
subset
Zj
=
Im(Zj∗
[C])
⊆
W
=
W
∗
[C]
def
def
by
Kj
⊆
W
,
then
Kj
is
compact;
moreover,
we
have
an
equality
def
Z∞
=
Zj
=
j∈J
Kj
⊆
W
j∈J
of
subsets
of
W
.
Now
suppose
that
for
each
j
∈
J,
zj
∈
Zj
;
let
z
∈
W
be
a
cluster
point
of
the
set
{zj
}j∈J
[i.e.,
some
subsequence
of
the
sequence
constituted
by
the
zj
converges
to
z].
[Note
that
since
the
Kj
are
compact,
such
a
cluster
point
always
exists.]
Then
I
claim
that
z
∈
Z∞
.
Indeed,
we
may
assume
[by
replacing
J
by

def
a
coﬁnal
subset
of
J]
that
zj
→
z.
Then
if
we
write
Aj
=
{zj

}j

≥j
{z},
then
Aj
⊆
Kj
,
so
Aj
⊆
Kj
=
Z∞
z∈
j∈J
j∈J
as
desired.
In
particular,
since
the
Zj
are
nonempty,
it
follows
that
Z∞
is
nonempty.
Now
I
claim
that
Z
=
{Zj∗
}j∈J
is
minimal
if
and
only
if
the
cardinality
|Z∞
|
of
the
set
Z∞
is
equal
to
1.
Indeed,
if
|Z∞
|
>
1,
then
it
is
immediate
that
one
can
CATEGORIES



construct
a
morphism
of
P-systems
Z

→
Z
such
that
Z∞

Z∞
[where
Z∞
is
the
analogue
of
“Z∞
”
for
Z

],
so
Z

→
Z
is
not
an
isomorphism
of
P-systems.
On
the
other
hand,
suppose
that
|Z∞
|
=
1.
Now
since
the
topological
space
W
is
clearly
metrizable,
let
us
assume
that
it
is
equipped
with
a
metric
d(−,
−).
Let
Z

=
{Zj∗
}j

∈J

→
Z
=
{Zj∗
}j∈J

be
a
morphism
of
P-systems
over
W
∗
.
Thus,
Z∞
=
Z∞
.
Write
Z∞
=
{z}.
Then
observe
that
for
every
real
>
0,
there
exists
a
j0
∈
J
such
that
for
all
j
≥
j0
,
Zj
def
is
contained
in
the
set
B(z,
)
=
{w
∈
W
|
d(z,
w)
<
}.
Indeed,
if
this
were
false,
then
it
would
follow
that
for
every
[suﬃciently
large,
hence
every]
j
∈
J,
there
exist
aj
,
bj
∈
Zj
such
that
d(aj
,
bj
)
≥
.
Moreover,
by
choosing
the
aj
,
bj
appropriately,
we
may
assume
that
aj
→
a,
bj
→
b,
for
some
a,
b
∈
W
.
But
by
our
discussion
of
cluster
points
in
the
preceding
paragraph,
it
thus
follows
that
a
=
b
=
z,
hence
that
≤
d(aj
,
bj
)
→
d(a,
b)
=
0,
which
is
absurd.
Thus,
we
conclude
that
Zj
⊆
B(z,
)
for
suﬃciently
large
j
∈
J.
On
the
other
hand,
since,
given
a
j

∈
J

,
there
exists
an
>
0
such
that
B(z,
)
⊆
Zj

,
it
thus
follows
immediately
that
Z

→
Z
is
an
isomorphism,
thus
proving
the
asserted
minimality
of
Z.
Thus,
in
summary,
we
conclude
that:
There
is
a
natural
bijective
correspondence
between
the
set
W
∗
[C]non
[where
the
subscript
“non”
denotes
the
open
subset
determined
by
the
noncricital
locus]
and
the
set
of
isomorphism
classes
of
minimal
P-systems
over
W
∗
.
In
particular,
since,
by
Proposition
2.2,
(iii),
Φ
preserves
parallelogram
objects,
we
conclude
that
Φ
induces
natural
bijections
∼
W1∗
[C]non
→
W2∗
[C]non
∗
∗
∗
∗
[where,
for
i
=
1,
2,
Wi∗
∈
Ob(LocP
Πi
(Xi
,
φi
)),
Φ(W1
)
=
W2
]
which
are
functorial
in
the
Wi∗
.
Moreover,
since
the
images
of
parallelograms
in
Wi∗
[C]
clearly
form
a
basis
for
the
topology
of
Wi∗
[C],
we
conclude
[by
considering
collections
of
isomorphism
classes
of
P-systems
over
Wi∗
that
factor
through
some
given
ﬁxed
parallelogram
over
Wi∗
]
that
these
bijections
are,
in
fact,
homeomorphisms.
Note
that
these
functorial
homeomorphisms
are
already
suﬃcient
to
conclude
that
the
category
C
is
slim
[cf.
the
proof
of
slimness
in
Theorem
1.12
via
Lemma
1.8].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Next,
let
us
observe
that
it
follows
from
our
assumption
that
Πi
is
“stackresolving”
that
there
exist
ﬁnite
Galois
[cf.
Proposition
2.2,
(i)]
Wi∗
such
that
Φ(W1∗
)
=
W2∗
,
and,
moreover,
Wi∗
is
of
complex
type,
with
trivial
“stack
structure”.
Thus,
it
follows,
by
applying
Proposition
A.4
[of
the
Appendix]
to
suﬃciently
small
pre-compact
parallelogram
neighborhoods
of
Wi∗
[C],
that,
in
the
case
of
assertion
(ii)
(respectively,
(iii)),
the
functorial
homeomorphism
∼
W1∗

[C]non
28
SHINICHI

constructed
above
is
locally
aﬃne
linear
(respectively,
locally
aﬃne
ortho-linear).
Now
in
the
aﬃne
linear
case,
it
follows
from
Proposition
A.1
[of
the
Appendix],
together
with
the
explicit
local
form
of
a
Teichmüller
mapping
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Lehto],
Chapter
V,
§7
and
§8,
especially
Theorem
8.1]
that
there
exists
an
RC-Teichmüller
mapping
with
domain
W1∗
[C]non
and
initial
diﬀerential
a
nonzero
complex
multiple
of
the
pull-back
to
W1∗
[C]non
of
φ∗1
[which
is
well-deﬁned
up
to
possible
confusion
with
its
complex
conjugate]
such
that
the
RC-holomorphic
structure
induced
on
this
domain
[via
this
RC-Teichmüller
mapping]
by
the
RC-holomorphic
structure
of
the
codomain
coincides
with
the
RC-holomorphic
structure
induced,
via
the
above
functorial
homeomorphism,
by
the
RC-holomorphic
structure
of
W2∗
[C]non
.
In
particular,
this
functorial
homeomorphism
factors
as
the
composite
of
an
RCTeichmüller
mapping
which
induces
the
identity
map
on
the
underlying
real
analytic
manifolds
with
an
isomorphism
of
RC-Riemann
orbisurfaces.
That
is
to
say,
the
functorial
homeomorphism
considered
above
is
an
RC-Teichmüller
mapping,
as
desired,
hence
extends
naturally
to
the
canonical
compactiﬁcations
[cf.
Remark
1.3.2]
of
the
Wi∗
[C]non
.
Moreover,
the
functoriality
of
this
homeomorphism
[together
with
the
fact
that
Wi∗
is
of
complex
type
with
trivial
“stack
structure”]
allows
one
to
descend
the
RC-Teichmüller
mapping
just
obtained
between
the
canonical
compactiﬁcations
of
the
Wi∗
[C]non
to
an
RC-Teichmüller
mapping
between
the
canonical
compactiﬁcations
of
the
Xi∗
,
hence
[by
our
assumption
that
Πi
is
totally
ramiﬁed
at
inﬁnity]
to
an
RC-Teichmüller
mapping
∼
X1∗
→
X2∗
thus
completing
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
[Here,
we
note
in
passing
that
Xi∗
is
of
complex
type
if
and
only
if
the
automorphisms
of
Wi∗
[C]non
induced
by
elements
of
Gal(Wi∗
/Xi∗
)
preserve
some
orientation
of
the
aﬃne
linear
structure.]
The
aﬃne
ortho-linear
case
follows
similarly
[but
is
somewhat
easier,
since
it
does
not
involve
any
Teichmüller
theory!].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii).

All
of

follow
formally
from
Theorem

(ii),
(iii).
Here,
we
note
that
in
the
genus

“torality”
is
[easily
veriﬁed
to
be]
equivalent
to
the
condition
that

from

extend
to
neighborhoods
of
the
“points

of

Once
one
has
established
“torality”,
the
property
of
being
of
torsion
type
is
completely
determined
by
the
aﬃne
linear
structure
determined
by
the
natural
parameters.

Next,
we
deﬁne
a
somewhat
diﬀerent
type
of
category
of
localizations,
namely,
a
category
of
ﬁnite
étale
localizations
[cf.
the
categories
“Loc(−)”,
“Lock

of
[Mzk7],
§2]
FELoc(X
∗
,
φ∗
)
associated
to
an
RC-Teichmüller
pair
(X

,
φ∗

The
objects
of
this
category
are
RC-Teichmüller
pairs
(Y

where
Y
∗
admits
a
ﬁnite

[of

Y

such
that

The

one
may
deﬁne
a

the

i.e.,

Moreover,

(i)
(respectively,

is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions
(respectively,
the
deﬁnitions

Next,
we
consider
assertion

Now
it

In

various

facts
concerning

algebra
of

that
are

respectively.
In

discussion,
we
shall
often
identify
the
real
vector
space
underlying
the

number
ﬁeld
C
with
R2
via
the
bijection
R2

(a,
b)
→
a
+
ib
∈
C.
This
identiﬁcation
determines
an
immersion
of
topological
groups
C×
→

2
(R)
by
mapping
C×

.
In

we
shall
often
b
a
identify
C×
with
its
image
under
this
immersion
and
write
“C×

The

is
normalized
by

by
which

If
M
∈
GL2
(R),
then
we
shall
write
fM
:
C
→
C
for
the
associated
map
from
C
to
itself.
Also,
we
shall
often
think
of
GL2
(R)
as
acting
on
the
upper
half-plane
H
in
the
standard
fashion,
via
linear

Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
It
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
the
natural
inclusion
SL2
(R)
→
GL>0
2
(R)
induces
a
homeomorphism
of
coset
spaces

Moreover,
if

H
given
by
letting

followed
by
the
homeomorphism
discussed
in
assertion
(ii)
of
H
with
the
open
unit
disk,
then
the
parametrization
of
assertion
(i)
is
clearly
mapped
onto
the
inverval
[0,
1),
which
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
quotient
of
the
unit
disk
by
the
action
of
the
unit
circle
S1
⊆
C×
.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
To
verify
assertion
(ii),
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
we
may
write
fM
(z)
=
c1
z+c2
z,
where
c1
=
a1
+ib1
,
c2
=
a2
+ib2
;
a1
,
a2
,
b1
,
b2
∈
R;
Dil(M
)
=
|c2
|/|c1
|.
This
description
of
fM
,
Dil(M
)
renders
evident
the
fact
that
M
→
Dil(M
)
depends
only
on
the
×
image
of
M
in
C×
\GL>0
2
(R)/C
.
Now
applying
Dil(−)
to
the
parametrization
of
t−1
assertion
(i)
yields
the
function
t+1
[since
2(ta+ib)
=
(t+1)(a+ib)+(t−1)(a−ib)].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).

35
or
aﬃne
ortho-linear
[i.e.,
either
aﬃne

or
aﬃne

is
by
applying
the
following
result:
Proposition
A.4.
(Squares,
Rectangles,
and
Parallelograms)
Let
B
⊆
R2
be
a
connected
open
subset;
let
h
:
B
→
R2
be
a
map
that
determines
a
homeomorphism
of
B
onto
a
parallelogram
of
R2
.
Then:
(i)
Suppose
that
h
maps
pre-compact
parallelograms
in
B
to
parallelograms
in
R2
.
Then
h
is
[the
restriction
to
B
of
a
map
R2
→
R2
that
is]
aﬃne
linear.
(ii)
Suppose
that
h
maps
pre-compact
rectangles
in
B
to
rectangles
in
R2
.
Then
h
is
[the
restriction
to
B
of
a
map
R2
→
R2
that
is]
aﬃne
ortho-linear.
(iii)
Suppose
that
h
maps
pre-compact
squares
in
B
to
squares
in
R2
.
Then
h
is
[the
restriction
to
B
of
a
map
R2
→
R2
that
is]
aﬃne
ortho-linear.
Proof.
First,
we
observe
that,
by
considering
squares
with
edges
parallel
to
the
coordinate
axes
contained
in
B
and
applying
an
appropriate
aﬃne
ortho-linear
map
to
B,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
B
itself
is
a
square
with
edges
parallel
to
the
coordinate
axes
centered
at
the
origin
that
contains
the
points
(a,
b),
where
a,
b
∈
R,
|a|
=
|b|
=
1.
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
Deﬁne
an
“edge-segment”
of
a
pre-compact
parallelogram
P
⊆
B
to
be
an
inﬁnite
set
of
the
form
K
K

,
where
K
is
the
closure
of
P
;
K

is
the
closure
of
another
pre-compact
parallelogram
P

;
and
P
P

=
∅.
Consider
the
equivalence
relation
on
edge-segments
of
P
generated
by
the
preequivalence
relation
that
two
edge-segments
E1
,
E2
are
“pre-equivalent”
if
the
intersection
E1
E2
is
inﬁnite.
Then
observe
that
the
edges
of
a
pre-compact
parallelogram
P
⊆
B
are
in
natural
bijective
correspondence
with
the
equivalence
classes
of
edge-segments
of
P
,
and
that,
under
this
bijective
correspondence,
an
edge
of
P
is
given
by
the
union
of
edge-segments
that
belong
to
the
corresponding
equivalence
class
of
edge-segments.
The
vertices
of
P
may
then
be
recovered
as
the
nonempty
intersections
of
pairs
of
edges.
Thus,
the
“aﬃne
linear
structure”
of
B
may
be
recovered
by
considering
the
combinatorics
of
intersections
among
the
various
edges
of
the
pre-compact
parallelograms
of
B
[i.e.,
in
the
notation
of
Deﬁnition
A.3,
(i),
this
combinatorial
data
encodes
precisely
the
information
that
“if
one
takes
w
as
the
origin,
then
the
sum
of
the
points
w
+
u,
w
+
v
is
equal
to
w
+
u
+
v”].
Since
this
description
of
the
aﬃne
linear
structure
of
B
is
preserved
by
h,
we
thus
conclude
that
h
is
aﬃne
linear,
as
desired.
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
By
composing
h
with
an
appropriate
aﬃne
ortho-linear
map
R2
→
R2
,
we
may
assume,
without
loss
of
generality,
that
h
ﬁxes
the
points
(0,
0)
and
(1,
1).
Next,
let
us
observe
that
the
[“rectangle-theoretic
analogue”
of
the
“parallelogram-theoretic”]
topological
description
of
vertices
and
36
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
edges
given
in
the
preceding
paragraph
[i.e.,
where
“P
”,
“P

”
are
assumed
to
be
rectangles]
implies
that
h
preserves
line
segments.
Since,
moreover,
a
square
may
be
characterized
as
a
rectangle
P
such
that
the
line
segments
given
by
the
diagonals
of
the
rectangle
are
orthogonal
[i.e.,
admit
sub-line
segments
that
appear
as
adjacent
edges
of
some
rectangle],
we
conclude
that
h
preserves
squares.
Thus,
to
complete
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii),
it
suﬃces
to
verify
assertion
(iii).
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
By
composing
h
with
an
appropriate
aﬃne
ortho-linear
map
R2
→
R2
,
we
may
assume,
without
loss
of
generality,
that
h
ﬁxes
the
points
(0,
0)
and
(1,
1).
Since
[as
one
veriﬁes
immediately]
there
is
precisely
one
square
S
⊆
R2
that
has
the
points
(0,
0)
as
(1,
1)
as
opposite
vertices,
one
concludes
from
the
topological
description
of
vertices
and
edges
given
above
that
h
preserves
this
square
S.
Thus,
by
possibly
composing
h
with
a
reﬂection
about
the
diagonal
of
S
[which
is
manifestly
an
aﬃne
ortho-linear
map],
we
may
assume
that
h
induces
the
identity
morphism
on
the
set
of
edges
of
S.
Moreover,
the
topological
description
of
the
vertices
and
edges
applied
above
also
implies
that
h
maps
line
segments
in
B
that
are
parallel
to
one
of
the
two
coordinate
axes
of
R2
[i.e.,
to
one
of
the
edges
of
S]
to
line
segments
in
R2
that
are
parallel
to
one
of
the
two
coordinate
axes
of
R2
.
On
the
other
hand,
this
last
property
implies
[in
light
of
the
fact
that
h
induces
the
identity
morphism
on
the
set
of
edges
of
S]
that
h
may
be
written
in
the
form
h((a,
b))
=
(f
(a),
g(b))
[where
f
,
g
are
real-valued
continuous
functions
on
some
open
interval
I
⊆
R
such
that
0
∈
I
and
I
is
preserved
by
multiplication
by
−1].
Since,
moreover,
h
preserves
squares,
it
follows
that
f
=
g.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
for
a,
b
∈
I
such
that
a,
b
=
0,
ab
∈
I,
the
fact
that
h
preserves
line
segments
[cf.
the
argument
applied
in
the
discussion
of
assertion
(ii)]
implies
that
f
(ab)/f
(a)
is
independent
of
a,
hence
[since
f
(1)
=
1]
that
f
(ab)
=
f
(a)
·
f
(b).
Since
f
(0)
=
0,
we
thus
conclude
that
for
all
a,
b
∈
I
such
that
ab
∈
I,
we
have
f
(ab)
=
f
(a)
·
f
(b).
Thus,
since
R×
is
a
real
analytic
Lie
group,
we
thus
conclude
[by
Cartan’s
theorem
—
cf.,
e.g.,
[Serre],
Chapter
V,
§9,
Theorem
2]
that
there
exists
a
positive
real
α
such
that
f
(x)
=
|x|α
·
(x/|x|)
for
all
nonzero
x
∈
I.
On
the
other
hand,
since,
for
suﬃciently
small
function
x
→
f
(x
+
)
−
f
(
)
>
0,
the
satisﬁes
similar
hypotheses
to
f
,
we
conclude
that
this
function
may
be
written,
at
least
for,
say,
x
∈
J
⊆
I,
where
J
is
some
open
inverval
of
positive
real
numbers,

in
the
form
x
→
c
·
xα
,
for
some
c,
α
>
0.
That
is
to
say,
we
obtain
the
relation
(x
+
)α
−
α
=
c
·
xα

[for
x
∈
J].
Thus,
by,
say,
diﬀerentiating
this
relation
with
respect
to
x,
taking
the
natural
logarithm,
and
then
diﬀerentiating
again
with
respect
to
x,
we
obtain
that
(α
−
1)x
=
(α
−
1)(x
+
)

[a
contradiction,
unless
α
=
α
=
1].
Thus,
α
=
α
=
1,
i.e.,
f
(x)
=
x
for
all
x
∈
I,
so
h
is
aﬃne
ortho-linear,
as
desired.
