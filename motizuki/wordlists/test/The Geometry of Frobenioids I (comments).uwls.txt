In
Deﬁnition
A.1
of
the
Appendix:
The
phrase
“isomorphism
classes
of
morphisms”
in
line
4
should
read
“isomorphism
classes
of
1-morphisms”.
The
phrase
“coarsiﬁcation
of
C”
in
line
5
should
read
“coarsiﬁcation
of
D”.
(2.)
The
hypothesis
that
the
Frobenioids
under
consideration
be
of
“unit-proﬁnite
type”
in
Proposition
5.6
—
hence
also
in
Corollary
5.7,
(iii)
—
may
be
removed.
Indeed,
if,
in
the
notation
of
the
proof
of
Proposition
5.6,
one
writes
φp
=
cp
·
φp
,
where
cp
∈
O×
(A),
for
p
∈
Primes,
then
one
has
c2
·
c2p
·
φ2
·
φp
=
c2
·
φ2
·
cp
·
φp
=
φ2
·
φp
=
φp
·
φ2
=
cp
·
φp
·
c2
·
φ2
=
cp
·
cp2
·
φp
·
φ2
=
cp
·
cp2
·
φ2
·
φp
—
so
c2
·
c2p
=
cp
·
cp2
,
i.e.,
cp
=
cp−1
,
for
p
∈
Primes.
Thus,
φp
=
c−1
2
2
·
φ
p
·
c2
,
so
by
taking
u
=
c−1
2
,
one
may
eliminate
the
ﬁnal
two
paragraphs
of
the
proof
of
Proposition
5.6.

should
read
“If

the

read

also,
in

same

the

immediately
following

SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
Suppose
that
φ
is
irreducible.
Then
φ
is
a
non-pre-step
if
and
only
if
the
following
condition
holds:
If
φ
is
an
FSM-morphism,
then
there
exists
an
N
∈
N≥1
such
that
for
every
equality
of
composites
in
C
αn
◦
αn−1
◦
.
.
.
◦
α2
◦
α1
=
ψ
◦
φ
—
where
α1
and
ψ
are
irreducible
morphisms,
n
∈
N≥1
,
and
α2
,
.
.
.
,
αn
,
ψ
are
FSMI-morphisms
[cf.
§0]
—
it
holds
that
n
≤
N
.
The
proof
of
Proposition
1.14,
(iii),
should
read
as
follows:
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
By
assertion
(i),
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
assertion
(iii)
holds
for
each
of
the
three
types
of
morphisms
“(a),
(b),
(c)”
discussed
in
assertion
(i).
If
φ
is
an
irreducible
pre-step
[hence
also,
by
assertion
(ii),
an
FSM-morphism],
then
it
follows
immediately
—
by
taking
ψ
to
be
a
prime-Frobenius
morphism
of
increasingly
large
Frobenius
degree
[cf.
assertion
(i);
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d);
Proposition
1.4,
(i);
Proposition
1.10,
(ii)]
—
that
the
condition
in
the
statement
of
assertion
(iii)
is
false
[as
desired].
On
the
other
hand,
if
φ
is
a
non-prestep,
then
it
is
an
isometry.
Now
if
the
condition
in
the
statement
of
assertion
(iii)
is
false,
then
φ
is
an
FSM-morphism,
and,
moreover,
there
exist
equalities
αn
◦
αn−1
◦
.
.
.
◦
α2
◦
α1
=
ψ
◦
φ
where
α1
and
ψ
are
irreducible
morphisms,
n
∈
N≥1
is
arbitrarily
large,
and
α2
,
.
.
.
,
αn
,
ψ
are
FSMI-morphisms.
Next,
observe
that
since
φ
is
an
isometry,
it
follows
from
the
fact
that
ψ
is
irreducible
[cf.
also
assertion
(i);
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(ii),
(b);
Remark
1.1.1;
Proposition
1.11,
(vi)]
that
Div(ψ
◦φ)
is
either
zero
or
irreducible;
since,
moreover,
degFr
(ψ
◦φ)
always
divides
a
product
of
two
prime
numbers
[cf.
assertion
(i);
the
irreducibility
of
φ,
ψ],
it
thus
follows
that
in
any
factorization
of
ψ
◦
φ
by
irreducible
morphisms,
all
but
three
[i.e.,
corresponding
to
two
possible
prime
factors
of
the
Frobenius
degree,
plus
one
possible
irreducible
factor
of
the
zero
divisor]
of
the
factorizing
irreducible
morphisms
are
pull-back
morphisms
[cf.
assertion
(i)].
On
the
other
hand,
this
implies
that
factorizations
of
arbitrarily
large
length
determine
chains
of
morphisms,
all
but
the
ﬁrst
of
which
are
FSMI-morphisms
[cf.
assertion
(i);
Proposition
1.11,
(vi)],
originating
from
the
projection
to
D
of
the
domain
of
φ
which
are
also
of
arbitrarily
large
length,
in
contradiction
to
condition
(b)
of
the
deﬁnition
of
a
“category
of
FSMFF-type”
in
§0.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii).
The
above
modiﬁcations
to
the
deﬁnition
of
the
term
“category
of
FSMFF-type”
and
to
the
statement
and
proof
of
Proposition
1.14,
(iii),
have
no
eﬀect
on
the
remainder
of
the
present
paper
or
on
subsequent
papers,
except
that
minor
formal
changes
are
necessary
in
the
proof
of
[FrdII],
Proposition
3.4,
(viii).
(29.)
The
following
modiﬁcations
concerning
the
birationalization
of
a
Frobenioid
should
be
made
to
§4:

“THE
GEOMETRY
OF
FROBENIOIDS
I”
(i)
The
statement
of
Proposition
4.4,
(ii),
should
read
as
follows:
The
functor
C
birat
→
F0D
of
(i)
determines
a
structure
of
preFrobenioid
of
group-like
type
on
C
birat
.
Moreover,
the
functor
C
→
C
birat
is
faithful.
In
particular,
for
every
A
∈
Ob(C)
with
image
Abirat
in
C
birat
,
the
functor
C
→
C
birat
determines
an
injection
of
groups
O
(A)gp
→
O×
(Abirat
).
Suppose,
further,
that
C
is
of
birationally
Frobenius-normalized
type
[cf.
Deﬁnition
4.5,
(i),
below].
Then
the
pre-Frobenioid
C
birat
is
a
Frobenioid;
we
shall
refer
to
the
functor
“O×
(−)”
on
D
associated
to
the
Frobenioid
C
birat
[cf.
Proposition
2.2,
(ii),
(iii)]
as
the
rational
function
monoid
of
the
Frobenioid
C.
(ii)
The
ﬁnal
paragraph
of
the
proof
of
Proposition
4.4
should
read
as
follows:
In
the
context
of
assertion
(ii),
we
observe
that
it
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions
[and
the
total
epimorphicity
of
C]
that
the
functor
C
→
C
birat
is
faithful
and
determines
an
injection
O
(A)gp
→
O×
(Abirat
),
for
A
∈
Ob(C).
In
light
of
the
“dictionary”
provided
by
assertion
(iv)
[cf.
also
Proposition
1.4,
(iv);
the
equivalence
of
categories
of
Proposition
1.9,
(ii)],
it
is
now
a
routine
exercise
to
check,
whenever
C
is
of
birationally
Frobeniusnormalized
type
[cf.
Deﬁnition
4.5,
(i),
below],
that
C
birat
is,
in
fact,
a
Frobenioid
of
group-like
type.
[Here,
in
the
context
of
the
veriﬁcation
of
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(c),
we
observe
that
the
natural
functor
C
birat
→
(C
istr
)birat
is
faithful
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(iii),
(d);
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(v),
(a);
Proposition
1.9,
(v);
the
total
epimorphicity
of
C],
that
every
object
of
(C
istr
)birat
is
Frobeniustrivial
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(i),
(a),
(b);
Proposition
1.4,
(i)],
and
that
any
group
G
such
(α
·
β)2
=
α2
·
β
2
for
all
α,
β
∈
G
is
abelian.]
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Now
assertion
(iii)
follows
immediately
from
the
existence
of
the
functor
C
birat
→
FΦgp
of
assertion
(i)
[cf.
also
Proposition
1.5,
(ii)];
here,
we
note
that
the
computation
of
the
kernel
of
the
surjection
of
assertion
(iii)
follows
from
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(vi).
(iii)
In
Proposition
4.8,
(ii):
the
phrase
“of
perfect
and
isotropic
type”
should
read
“of
perfect,
isotropic,
and
birationally
Frobenius-normalized
type”.
(iv)
In
Proposition
4.8,
(iv):
the
phrase
“pre-model
type”
should
read
“model
type”.
(v)
The
portion
preceding
the
display
of
the
ﬁrst
sentence
in
the
proof
of
Corollary
4.11,
(ii),
should
read
as
follows:
“First,
we
observe
that,
by
assertion
(i),
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
C
is
of

unit-trivial,
hence
also
[cf.
Proposition
4.4,
(iii)]
birationally
Frobeniusnormalized
type;
moreover,
we
have
a
1-commutative
diagram”.
The
above
modiﬁcations
have
no
eﬀect
on
the
remainder
of
the
present
paper
or
on
subsequent
papers,
except
that
minor
formal
changes
are
necessary
in
[FrdII],
Deﬁnition
5.3,
(v);
[FrdII],
Proposition
5.4;
the
statement
and
proof
of

Theorem
5.5,
(iv).

In
the
discussion
of
the
“new
functor”
in
the
proof
of
Theorem
3.4,
(v),
the
following
misprints
should
be
corrected:
·
“(Pi

should
read
“(Pi

”;
·
“(Pi

should
read
“(Pi

“(Pi

should
read
“(Pi

·
“(Pi

should
