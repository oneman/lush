The
content
of
·
Theorem
3.1;
·
Proposition
4.3;
·
Proposition
4.4
of
the
present
paper
depend
on
the
portions
of
the
theory
of
[LgSch],
§2,
that
are
in
error
[cf.
[MnLgSch],
Example
0.3;
[MnLgSch],
Remark
1.4.1,
for
more
details].
In
particular,
these
errors
in
[LgSch],
§2,
aﬀect
the
proof
—
although
not
the
validity!
—
of
the
main
theorem
of
the
present
paper
[i.e.,
Theorem
5.1].
This
result
Theorem
5.1
is
given
a
correct
proof
in
[MnLgSch],
§4
[cf.
[MnLgSch],
Theorem
4.8,
(iv)].
Finally,
we
remark
that,
at
the
level
of
main
results
of
papers
of
the
author
subsequent
to
[LgSch],
the
only
place
where
the
errors
in
the
theory
of
[LgSch],
§2,
have
an
aﬀect
is
in
the
present
paper,
as
discussed
above.
More
details
on
the
aﬀected
portions
of
the
present
paper,
as
well
as
of
[LgSch],
may
be
found
in
the
Appendix
to
[MnLgSch].
