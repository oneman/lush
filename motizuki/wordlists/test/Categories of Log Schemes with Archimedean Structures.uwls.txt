The
Main
Theorem
Introduction
As
is
discussed
in
the
Introduction
to
[Mzk2],
it
is
natural
to
ask
to
what
extent
various
objects
—
such
as
log
schemes
—
that
occur
in
arithmetic
geometry
may
be
represented
by
categories,
i.e.,
to
what
extent
one
may
reconstruct
the
original
object
solely
from
the
category-theoretic
structure
of
a
category
naturally
associated
to
the
object.
As
is
explained
in
loc.
cit.,
this
point
of
view
is
partially
motivated
by
the
anabelian
philosophy
of
Grothendieck.
In
the
present
paper,
we
extend
the
theory
of
[Mzk2],
which
only
concerns
log
schemes,
to
obtain
a
theory
that
proves
a
similar
categorical
representability
result
[cf.
Theorem
3.4
below]
for
what
we
call
“arithmetic
log
schemes”
[cf.
Deﬁnitions
2.1,
2.2
below],
i.e.,
log
schemes
that
are
locally
of
ﬁnite
type
over
a
Zariski
localization
of
the
ring
of
rational
integers
and,
moreover,
are
equipped
with
certain
“archimedean
structures”
at
archimedean
primes.
In
§1,
we
review
the
theory
of
[Mzk2],
and
revise
the
formulation
of
the
main
theorem
of
[Mzk2]
slightly
[cf.
Theorem
1.1].
In
§2,
we
deﬁne
the
notion
of
an
archimedean
structure
on
a
ﬁne,
saturated
log
scheme
which
is
of
ﬁnite
type

Finally,
in

we
generalize
Theorem

[cf.
Theorem
3.4]
so
as
to
take
into
account
these
archimedean
structures.

I

Numbers:
We
will
denote
by
N
the
set
(or,
occasionally,
the
commutative
monoid)
of
natural
numbers,
by
which
we
take
to
consist
set
of
the
integers
n
≥
0.
A
number
ﬁeld
is
deﬁned
to
be
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
the
ﬁeld
of
rational
numbers
Q.
The
ﬁeld
of
real
numbers
(respectively,
complex
numbers)
will
be
denoted
by
R
(respectively,
C).
The
topological
group
of
complex
numbers
of
unit
norm
will
be
denoted
by
S1
⊆
C.
We
shall
say
that
a
scheme
S
is
a
Zariski
localization
of
Z
if
S
=
Spec(R),
where
R
=
M
−1
·
Z,
for
some
multiplicative
subset
M
⊆
Z.
Topological
Spaces:
In
this
paper,
the
term
“compact”
is
to
be
understood
to
include
the
assumption
that
the
topological
space
in
question
is
Hausdorﬀ.
(The
author
wishes
to
thank
A.
Tamagawa
for
his
comments
concerning
the
importance
of
making
this
assumption
explicit.)
Also,
when
a
topological
space
H
is
equipped
with
an
involution
σ
(typically
an
action
of
“complex
conjugation”),
we
shall
denote
by
HR
(i.e.,
a
superscript
“R”)
the
quotient
topological
space
of
“σ-orbits”.
Categories:
Let
C
be
a
category.
We
shall
denote
the
collection
of
objects
of
C
by:
Ob(C)
If
A
∈
Ob(C)
is
an
object
of
C,
then
we
shall
denote

the

whose

whose

an

B1

to
an

are
A-morphisms
B1

in
C.
Thus,
we
have
a
natural
functor
(jA

:
CA
→
C
(given
by
forgetting
the
structure
morphism
to
A).
Similarly,
if
f
:
A
→
B
is
a
morphism
in
C,
then
f
deﬁnes
a
natural
functor
f!
:
CA
→
CB
by
mapping
an
arrow
(i.e.,
an
object
of
CA
)
C
→
A
to
the
object
of
CB
given
by
the
composite
C

A
→

with
f.
If
the
category
C
admits
ﬁnite
products,
then
(jA

is
left
adjoint
to
the
natural

jA
:

given
by
taking
the

and

to
the
natural
functor
f
∗
:
CB

given
by
taking
the
ﬁbered
product
over

with

We
shall
call
an

A
∈
Ob(C)
terminal
if
for
every
object
B
∈
Ob(C),
there
exists
a
unique
arrow
B

in

We
shall
call
an

quasiterminal
if
for
every

Ob(C),
there
exists
an
arrow
φ
:
B

in
C,
and,
moreover,
for
every
other
arrow
ψ
:
B
→
A,
there
exists
an
automorphism
α
of
A
such
that
ψ
=
α
◦
φ.
We
shall
refer
to
a
natural
transformation
between
functors
all
of
whose
component
morphisms
are
isomorphisms
as
an
isomorphism
between
the
functors
in
question.
A
functor
φ
:
C1
→
C2
between
categories
C1
,
C2
will
be
called
rigid
if
φ
has
no
nontrivial
automorphisms.
A
category
C
will
be
called
slim
if
the
natural
functor
CA

C
is
rigid,
for
every
A
∈
Ob(C).
If
C
if
a
category
and
S
is
a
collection
of
arrows
in
C,
then
we
shall
say
that
an
arrow
A
→
B
is
minimal-adjoint
to
S
if
every
factorization
A
→
C
→
B
of
this
arrow
A
→
B
in
C
such
that
A
→
C
lies
in
S
satisﬁes
the
property
that
A
→
C
is,
in
fact,
an
isomorphism.
Often,
the
collection
S
will
be
taken
to
be
the
collection
of
arrows
satisfying
a
particular
property
P;
in
this
case,
we
shall
refer
to
the
property
of
being
“minimal-adjoint
to
S”
as
the
minimal-adjoint
notion
to
P.
Section
1:
Review
of
the
Theory
for
Log
Schemes
We
begin
our
discussion
by
reviewing
the
theory
for
log
schemes
developed
in
[Mzk2].
Also,
we
give
a
slight
extension
of
this
theory
(to
the
case
of
locally
noetherian
log
schemes
and
morphisms
which
are
locally
of
ﬁnite
type).
In
the
4
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
context
of
this
extension,
it
is
natural
to
modify
the
notation
used
in
[Mzk2]
slightly
as
follows:
Let
us
denote
by
Schlog
the
category
of
all
locally
noetherian
ﬁne
saturated
log
schemes
and
locally
ﬁnite
type
morphisms,
and
by
NSchlog
the
category
of
all
noetherian
ﬁne
saturated
log
schemes
and
ﬁnite
type
morphisms.
Note
that
NSchlog
⊆
Schlog
may
be
characterized
as
the
full
subcategory
consisting
of
the
X
log
for
which
X
is
noetherian.
If
X
log
is
a
ﬁne
saturated
log
scheme
whose
underlying
scheme
X
is
locally
noetherian,
then
we
shall
write
def
Schlog
(X
log
)
=
(Schlog
)X
log
and
NSchlog
(X
log
)
⊆
Schlog
(X
log
)
for
the
full
subcategory
consisting
of
the
Y
log
→
X
log
for
which
Y
is
noetherian.
Thus,
when
X
is
noetherian,
we
have
NSchlog
(X
log
)
=
(NSchlog
)X
log
.
To
simplify
terminology,
we
shall
often
refer
to
the
domain
Y
log
of
an
arrow
Y
→
X
log
which
is
an
object
of
Schlog
(X
log
)
or
NSchlog
(X
log
)
as
an
“object
of
Schlog
(X
log
)
or
NSchlog
(X
log
)”.
log
If
X
log
,
Y
log
are
locally
noetherian
ﬁne
saturated
log
schemes,
then
denote
the
∼
set
of
isomorphisms
of
log
schemes
X
log
→
Y
log
by:
Isom(X
log
,
Y
log
)
Then
the
main
result
of
[Mzk2]
[cf.
[Mzk2],
Theorem
2.19]
states
that
the
natural
map
Isom(X
log
,
Y
log
)
→
Isom(NSchlog
(Y
log
),
NSch(X
log
))
given
by
f
log
→
NSchlog
(f
log
)
[i.e.,
mapping
an
isomorphism
to
the
induced
equivalence
between
“NSchlog
(−)’s”]
is
bijective.
(Here,
the
“Isom”
on
the
right
is
to
be
understood
to
denote
isomorphism
classes
of
equivalences
between
the
two
categories
in
parentheses.)
This
result
generalizes
immediately
to
the
case
of
“Schlog
(−)”:
Theorem
1.1.
(Categorical
Reconstruction
of
Locally
Noetherian
Fine
Saturated
Log
Schemes)
Let
X
log
,
Y
log
be
locally
noetherian
ﬁne
saturated
log
schemes.
Then
the
natural
map
Isom(X
log
,
Y
log
)
→
Isom(Schlog
(Y
log
),
Schlog
(X
log
))

is
bijective.
Proof.
Indeed,
by
functoriality
and
[Mzk2],
Theorem
2.19,
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
the
subcategory
NSchlog
(X
log
)
⊆
Schlog
(X
log
)
may
be
recovered
“category-theoretically”.
To
see
this,
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
the
proof
given
in
[Mzk2]
[cf.
[Mzk2],
Corollary
2.14]
of
the
category-theoreticity
of
the
property
that
a
morphism
in
NSchlog
(X
log
)
be
“scheme-like”
(i.e.,
that
the
log
structure
on
the
domain
is
the
pull-back
of
the
log
structure
on
the
codomain)
is
entirely
valid
in
Schlog
(X
log
).
(Indeed,
the
proof
essentially
only
involves
morphisms
among
“one-pointed
objects”,
which
are
the
same
in
NSchlog
(X
log
),
Schlog
(X
log
).)
Moreover,
once
one
knows
which
morphisms
are
scheme-like,
the
open
immersions
may
be
characterized
category-theoretically
as
in
[Mzk2],
Corollary
1.3.
Next,
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
the
property
that
a
collection
of
open
immersions
Yαlog
→
Y
log
(where
α
ranges
over
the
elements
of
some
index
set
A)
in
Schlog
(X
log
)
be
surjective
is
category-theoretic.
Indeed,
this
follows
from
the
fact
that
this
collection
is
surjective
if
and
only
if,
for
any
morphism
Z
log
→
Y
log
,
where
Z
log
is
nonempty,
the
ﬁber
product
Yαlog
×Y
log
Z
log
in
Schlog
(X
log
)
[cf.
[Mzk2],
Lemma
2.6]
is
nonempty
for
some
α
[cf.
also
[Mzk2],
Proposition
1.1,
(i),
applied
to
the
complement
of
the
union
of
the
images
of
the
Yαlog
].
Thus,
it
suﬃces
to
observe
that
an
object
Y
log
is
noetherian
if
and
only
if,
for
any
surjective
collection
of
open
immersions
(in
Schlog
(X
log
))
Yαlog
→
Y
log
(where
α
ranges
over
the
elements
of
some
index
set
A),
there
exists
a
ﬁnite
subset
B
⊆
A
such
that
the
collection
{Yβlog
→
Y
log
}β∈B
is
surjective.

Remark
1.1.1.
Similar
[but
easier]
results
hold
for
Sch
(respectively,
NSch)
—
i.e.,
the
category
of
all
locally
noetherian
schemes
and
locally
ﬁnite
type
morphisms
(respectively,
all
noetherian

schemes
and

Section
2:
Archimedean
Structures
In
this
§,
we
generalize
the
categories
deﬁned
in
[Mzk2]
so
as
to
include
archimedean
primes.
In
particular,
we
prepare
for
the
proof
in
§3
below
of
a
global
arithmetic
analogue
[cf.
Theorem
3.4]
of
Theorem
1.1.

SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
Let
X
log
be
a
ﬁne,
saturated
locally
noetherian
log
scheme
(with
underlying
scheme
X).
Deﬁnition
2.1.
We
shall
say
that
X
is
arithmetically
(locally)
of
ﬁnite
type
if
X
is
(locally)
of
ﬁnite
type
over
a
Zariski
localization
of
Z.
Similarly,
we
shall
say
that
X
log
is
arithmetically
(locally)
of
ﬁnite
type
if
X
is.
def
Suppose
that
X
log
is
arithmetically
locally
of
ﬁnite
type.
Then
XQlog
=
X
log
⊗Z
Q
is
locally
of
ﬁnite
type
over
Q.
In
particular,
the
set
of
C-valued
points
X(C)
is
equipped
with
a
natural
topology
(induced
by
the
topology
of
C),
together
with
an
involution
σX
:
X(C)
→
X(C)
induced
by
the
complex
conjugation
automorphism
on
C.
Similarly,
in
the
logarithmic
context,
it
is
natural
to
consider
the
topological
space
def
gp
X
log
(C)
=
{(x,
θ)
|
x
∈
X(C),
θ
∈
Hom(MX,x
,
S1
)
×
}
s.t.
θ(f)
=
f(x)/|f(x)|,
∀f
∈
OX,x
[cf.
[KN],
§1.2].
Here,
we
use
the
notation
MX
to
denote
the
monoid
that
deﬁnes
the
log
structure
of
X
log
[cf.
[Mzk2],
§2].
Thus,
we
have
a
natural
surjection
X
log
(C)
→
X(C)
whose
ﬁbers
are
(noncanonically)
isomorphic
to
products
of
ﬁnitely
many
copies
of
S1
.
Also,
we
observe
that
it
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
that
σX
extends
to
an
involution
σX
log
on
X
log
(C).
Deﬁnition
2.2.
(i)
Let
H
⊆
X(C)
be
a
compact
subset
stabilized
by
σX
.
Then
we
shall
refer
to
a
pair
X
=
(X,
H)
as
an
arithmetic
scheme,
and
H
as
the
archimedean
structure
on
X.
We
shall
say
that
an
archimedean
structure
H
⊆
X(C)
is
trivial
(respectively,
total)
if
H
=
∅
(respectively,
H
=
X(C)).
(ii)
Let
H
⊆
X
log
(C)
be
a
compact
subset
stabilized
by
σX
log
.
Then
we
log
=
(X
log
,
H)
as
an
arithmetic
log
scheme,
and
H
as
shall
refer
to
a
pair
X
log
the
archimedean
structure
on
X
.
We
shall
say
that
an
archimedean
structure
H
⊆
X
log
(C)
is
trivial
(respectively,
total)
if
H
=
∅
(respectively,
H
=
X
log
(C)).
Remark
2.2.1.
The
idea
that
“integral
structures
at
archimedean
primes”
should
be
given
by
compact/bounded
subsets
of
the
set
of
complex
valued
points
may
be
seen
in
the
discussion
of
[Mzk1],

Remark
2.2.2.
Relative
to
Deﬁnition
2.2,
one
may
think
of
the
case
where
“H”
is
open
as
the
case
of
an
ind-arithmetic
(log)
scheme
[or,
alternatively,
an
“ind-archimedean
structure”],
i.e.,
the
inductive
system
of
arithmetic
(log)
schemes
[or,
alternatively,
archimedean
structures]
determined
by
considering
all
compact
subsets
that
lie
inside
the
given
open.
Let
us
denote
the
category
of
all
arithmetic
log
schemes
by:
log
Sch
log
log
Thus,
a
morphism
X
1
=
(X1log
,
H1
)
→
X
2
=
(X2log
,
H2
)
in
this
category
is
a
locally
ﬁnite
type
morphism
X1log
→
X2log
such
that
the
induced
map
X1log
(C)
→
X2log
(C)
maps
H1
into
H2
.
The
full
subcategory
of
noetherian
objects
of
Sch
objects
whose
underlying
scheme
is
noetherian]
will
be
denoted
by:
NSch
log
log
[i.e.,
log
⊆
Sch
Similarly,
if
we
forget
about
log
structures,
we
obtain
categories
NSch,
Sch.
Deﬁnition
2.3.
(i)
An
arithmetic
(log)
scheme
will
be
called
purely
nonarchimedean
if
its
archimedean
structure
is
trivial.
(ii)
A
morphism
between
arithmetic

will
be
called
purely

On
the
other
hand,
if
T
is
a
topological
space,
then
let
us
write
Open(T

(respectively,
Closed(T

for
the
category
whose
objects
are
open
subsets
U
⊆
T
(respectively,
closed
subsets

)
and
whose
morphisms
are
inclusions
of
subsets
of
T
.
Thus,
one
veriﬁes
easily
(by
taking
complements!)
that
Closed(T
)
is
the
opposite
category
Open(T

associated
to
Open(T
).
Also,
let
us
write
Shv(T

for
the
category
of
sheaves
on
T
(valued
in
sets).
Now
we
have
the
following:

an

log
log
(ii)
Let
X
1
,
X

∈
Ob(Sch

log
Φ

Sch
).
Suppose
that
log
∼
log
(X

→

is
an
equivalence
of
categories
that
preserves

(i.e.,
log
log
an

f
in
Sch
(X

is
purely

if
and
only
if
Φ(f)
is

Then
one
can
construct,
for

Ob(Sch

a
homeomorphism
∼
K1R

K2R
which
is
functorial
in
Y1log
.
Proof.
Assertion
(i)
is
a
formal
consequence
of
the
deﬁnitions.
To
prove
assertion
(ii),
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
(for
an
arbitrary
topological
space
T
)
Shv(T
)
may
be
reconstructed
functorially
from
Open(T
),
since
coverings
of
objects
of
Open(T
)
may
be
characterized
as
collections
of
objects
whose
inductive
limit
(a
purely
categorical
notion!)
is
isomorphic
to
the
object
to
be
covered.
Thus,
our
assumption
on
Φ,
together
with
assertion
(i),
implies
that
(for
i
=
1,
2)
Shv(KiR
)
may
be
reconstructed
category-theoretically
from
Yilog
in
a
fashion
which
is
functorial
in

.
Moreover,
since
KiR
is
clearly

topological
space,
we
thus
conclude

Before

we

the

then
we
may
form
the

of

X3log
over
X2log
by
equipping
the

is
easily
seen
to
be
arithmetically
locally
of
ﬁnite

with
the

given
by
the
inverse
image
of

we

that

that

the

Proposition
2.6.
(Minimal
Objects)
An
object
Y
of

be

minimal
if
it
is
nonempty
and
satisﬁes
the
property
that
any

Y
(where
Z

in

isomorphism.
An
object
Y
of
Sch
(X
)
is
minimal
if
and
only
if
it
is
purely
nonarchimedean
and
log
scheme-theoretically
minimal
[i.e.,
the
underlying
object
Y
log
of
Schlog
(X
log
)
is
minimal
as
an
object
of
Sch(X
log
)
—
cf.
[Mzk2],
Proposition
2.4].
Proof.
The
suﬃciency
of
this
condition
is
clear,
since
the
domain
of
any
morphism
log
in
Sch
to
a
purely
nonarchimedean
object
is
necessarily
itself
purely
nonarchimedean
[i.e.,
no
nonempty
set
maps
to
an
empty
set].
That
this
condition
is
necessary
is
evident
from
the
deﬁnitions
(e.g.,
if
a
nonempty
object
fails
to
be
purely
nonarchimedean,
then
it
can
always
be
“made
smaller”
[but
still
nonempty!]
by
setting
the
archimedean
structure
equal
to
the
empty
set,
thus
precluding
“minimality”).

Proposition
2.7.
(Characterization
of
One-Pointed
Objects)
We
shall
log
call
an
object
of
Sch
one-pointed

the

space
of
its
log
underlying
scheme
consists
of
precisely
one
point.
The
one-pointed
objects
Y

of

)
may
be
characterized
category-theoretically
as
the

which
satisfy

property:

Proof.
Assertion
(i)
is
a
formal
consequence
of
Proposition

[and
the
deﬁnitions

As
for
assertion
(ii),
the
necessity
of
the
condition
is
a
formal
consequence
of
the
deﬁnitions
of
the
terms
involved.
To
prove
suﬃciency,
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
by
[Mzk2],
Lemma
2.2;
[Mzk2],
Proposition
2.3,
it
follows
from
this
condition
that
the
underlying
morphism
of
log
schemes
Y
log
→
Z
log
is
scheme-like
[i.e.,
the
log
structure
on
Y
log
is
the
pull-back
of
the
log
structure
on
Z
log
].
Thus,
this
condition
implies
that
the
underlying
morphism
of
schemes
Y
→
Z
is
smooth
[cf.
[Mzk2],
Corollary
1.2]
and
surjective.
But
this
implies
[cf.
[Mzk2],
Corollary
1.3]
that
Y
→
Z
is
a
surjective
open
immersion,
hence
that
it
is
an
isomorphism
of
schemes.
Since
Y
log
→
Z
log
is
scheme-like,
we
thus
conclude
that
Y
log
→
Z
log
is
an
isomorphism
of
log
schemes,
as
desired.

Thus,
Corollary
2.10,
(ii),
implies
that
the
hypothesis
of
Proposition

is
automatically
satisﬁed.
This
allows
us
to
conclude
the
following:

The

In

of
the

theorem
of
the
present
paper
by
showing
that
the

Deﬁnition
3.1.
We
shall
say
that
an

is
aﬃne,
connected,
and
normal,
and,
moreover,
the
Rsuperscripted
topological
space
determined
by

consists
of
precisely

Note
that
by
Corollaries

2.12,
the
notion
of
a
“test

is
“categorytheoretic”.
log
Lemma
3.2.
(Nonlogarithmic
Global
Compatibility)
Let
X
be
an
log
log
log
log
object
in
Sch
.
Then
every
object
S
∈
Ob(Sch
(X
))
is
nonlogarithmically
globally
compatible.
Proof.
By
the
functoriality
of
the
diagram
discussed
in
Remark
2.12.1,
it
follows
immediately
that
it
suﬃces
to
prove
the
nonlogarithmic
global
compatibility
of
test
log
objects
S
=
(S
log
,
HS
).
Since
S
is
assumed
to
be
aﬃne,
write
S
=
Spec(R).
Then
we
may
think
of
the
single
point
of
HSR
as
deﬁning
an
“archimedean
valuation”
vR
on
the
ring
R.
Write
Y
log
=
(Y
log
,
HY
)
→
S
log
=
(S
log
,
HS
)
log
for
the
projective
line
over
S
,
equipped
with
the
log
structure
obtained
by
pulling
back
the
log
structure
of
S
log
and
the
archimedean
structure
which
is
the
inverse
log
image
of
the
archimedean
structure
of
S
.
Note
that
this
archimedean
structure
may
be
characterized
“category-theoretically”
[cf.
Corollaries
2.11,
2.12]
as
the
archimedean
structure
which
yields
a
quasi-terminal
object
[cf.
§0]
in
the
subcatlog
log
egory
of
Sch
(S
)
consisting
of
purely
archimedean
morphisms
among
objects
with
underlying
log
scheme
isomorphic
(over
S
log
)
to
Y
log
.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
to
reconstruct
the
log
scheme
S
log
via
Corollary
2.12
amounts,
in
eﬀect,
to
applying
the
theory
of
[Mzk2].
Moreover,
in
the
theory
of
[Mzk2],
the
set
underlying
the
ring
R
=
Γ(S,
OS
)
is
reconstructed
as
the
set
of
log
log
that
avoid
the
∞-section
(of
the
projective
line
Y
).
Moreover,
sections
S
→
Y
the
topology
determined
on
R
by
the
“archimedean
valuation”
vR
is
precisely
the
topology
on
this
set
of
sections
determined
by
considering
the
induced
sections
log
log
HSR
→
HYR
[i.e.,
two
sections
S
→
Y
are
“close”
if
and
only
if
their
induced
sections
HSR
→
HYR
are
“close”].
Thus,
we
conclude
(via
Corollary
2.11)
that
this
topology
on
R
is
a
“category-theoretic
invariant”.

On
the
other
hand,
it
is
immediate
that
the
point

up
to

determined
by
HSR
may
be
recovered
from
this
topology
—
i.e.,

(Logarithmic

Then
every

∈
Ob(Sch
(X
))
is

).
Proof.
The
proof
is
entirely
similar
to
the
proof
of
Lemma
3.2.
In
particular,
we
log
reduce
immediately
to
the
case
where
S
is
a
test
object.
Since,
by
Corollary
2.12,
the
structure
of
the
underlying
log
scheme
S
log
is
already
known
to
be
categorytheoretic,
we
may
even
assume,
without
loss
of
generality,
that
the
monoid
MS
is
log
generated
by
its
global
sections.
This
time,
instead
of
considering
Y
,
we
consider
the
object
log
log
Z
=
(Z
log
,
HZ
)
→
S
=
(S
log
,
HS
)
obtained
by
“appending”
to
the
log
structure
of
Y
log
the
log
structure
determined
by
the
divisor
given
by
the
zero
section
(of
the
projective
line
Y
).
As
in
the
case
log
log
of
Y
,
we
take
the
archimedean
structure
on
Z
to
be
the
inverse
image
of
the
log
log
archimedean
structure
of
S
.
Also,
just
as
in
the
case
of
Y
,
this
archimedean
structure
may
be
characterized
category-theoretically.
Now
if
we
think
of
the
unique
point
in
HSR
as
a
pair
(up
to
complex
conjugation)
(s,
θ)
[cf.
the
discussion
preceding
Deﬁnition
2.2],
then
it
remains
to
show
that
θ
may
be
“recovered
category-theoretically”.
To
this
end,
let
us
ﬁrst
recall
that
s
∈
S(C)
determines
a
morphism
Spec(C)
→
S
with
respect
to
which
one
may
pull-back
the
log
structure
on
S
to
obtain
a
log
structure
on
Spec(C).
By
Lemma
3.2,
we
may
also
assume,
without
loss
of
generality,
that
S
is
“suﬃciently
[Zariski]
local
with
respect
to
s”
in
the
sense
that
the
image
of
Γ(S,
OS×
)
in
C
is
dense.
Moreover,
this
log
structure
on
Spec(C)
amounts
to
the
datum
of
a
monoid
MS,s
containing
the
unit
circle
S1
⊆
C.
Thus,
relative
to
this
notation,
θ
[cf.
the
discussion
preceding
Deﬁnition
2.2]
may
be
thought
of
as
the
datum
of
a
surjective
homomorphism
gp
θ
:
MS,s

S1
[where
surjectivity
follows
from
the
fact
that
this
homomorphism
restricts
to
the
gp
].
In
fact,
since
θ
is
required
to
restrict
to
the
identity
on
identity
on
S1
⊆
MS,s
gp
1
S
⊆
MS,s
⊆
MS,s
,
it
follows
that
the
surjection
θ
is
completely
determined
by
its
kernel.
Thus,
in
summary,
θ
may
be
thought
of
as
being
the
datum
of
a
certain
gp
quotient
of
the
group
MS,s
,
or,
indeed,
as
a
certain
quotient
of
the
monoid
MS,s
.
Next,
let
us
recall
[cf.
the
proof
of
Lemma
3.2]
that
in
the
theory
of
[Mzk2][cf.
the
discussion
preceding
[Mzk2],
Lemma
2.16],
the
set
Γ(S,
MS
)
16
SHINICHI

log
log
is
reconstructed
as
the
set
of
sections
S
→
Z
that
avoid
the
∞-section
(of
the
projective
line
Z).
Observe
that
[just
as
in
the
proof
of
Lemma
3.2]
this
set
of
sections
is
equipped
with
a
natural
topology
determined
by
the
induced
sections
log
log
HSR
→
HZR
—
i.e.,
two
sections
S
→
Z
are
“close”
if
and
only
if
their
inR
R
duced
sections
HS
→
HZ
are
“close”.
Thus,
from
the
point
of
view
of
elements
of
Γ(S,
MS
),
two
elements
of
Γ(S,
MS
)
are
“close”
if
and
only
if
their
images
under
gp
the
composite
of
the
natural
morphism
Γ(S,
MS
)
→
MS,s
with
the
surjection
θ
are
“close”.
In
particular,
if
we
denote
by
Γ(S,
MS
)θ
the
completion
of
the
set
Γ(S,
MS
)
with
respect
to
this
[not
necessarily
separated]
topology,
then
it
follows
immediately
[from
our
assumption
that
S
is
“suﬃciently
[Zariski]
local
with
respect
to
s”]
that
the
image
of
Γ(S,
OS×
)
⊆
Γ(S,
MS
)
in
this
completion
may
be
identiﬁed
with
S1
.
Since,
moreover,
sequences
of
elements
of
Γ(S,
MS
)
that
converge
to
elements
of
MS,s
that
lie
in
the
kernel
of
θ
clearly
map
to
0
in
the
completion
Γ(S,
MS
)θ
,
we
conclude
that
the
closure
of
the
image
of
Γ(S,
OS×
)
in
Γ(S,
MS
)θ
[which
may
be
identiﬁed
with
a
copy
of
S1
]
is,
in
fact,
equal
to
Γ(S,
MS
)θ
,
and,
moreover,
that
relative
to
this
identiﬁcation
of
Γ(S,
MS
)θ
with
S1
,
the
natural
completion
morphism
Γ(S,
MS
)
→
Γ(S,
MS
)θ
=
S1
gp
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
composite
of
the
natural
morphism
Γ(S,
MS
)
→
MS,s
with
θ.
That
is
to
say,
[in
light
of
our
assumption
that
the
monoid
MS
is
generated
by
its
global
sections]
the
kernel
of
θ,
hence
θ
itself,
may
be
recovered
from
the
following
data:
the
log
scheme
S
log
[as
reconstructed
in
[Mzk2]],
together
with
the
topology
considered
above
on
Γ(S,
MS
).
Since
this
topology
is
“category-theoretic”
by
Corollary
2.11,
this
completes
the
proof
of
Lemma
3.3.

We
are
now
ready
to
state
the
main
result
of
the
present
§,
i.e.,
the
following
global

of

Let

of

If
E
is
equipped
with
a
Hermitian
metric
at
each
archimedean

of

then,
by
taking
the

on

that

of

≤

[hence
include
the
complex-valued
points
of

we
obtain
an
arithmetic

Now
suppose
that
S
is
equipped
with

equipped
with
a
Hermitian
metric).
In
particular,
in
the
notation
of
(i),
when
E
is
a
line
bundle,
the
choice
of
a(n)
closed
(respectively,
open)
angular
region
of
radius
1
at
each
of
the
complex
archimedean
primes
of
F
determines
a(n)
(ind-)archimedean
structure
[cf.
Remark
2.2.2]
on
V
log
.
Thus,
the
(ind-)arithmetic
log
schemes
discussed
in
(i)
correspond
to
the
case
where
all
of
the
angular
regions
chosen
are
isotropic.
Remark
3.5.1.
When
the
vector
bundle
E
of
Example
3.5
is
a
line
bundle
[i.e.,
of
rank
one],
the
blow-up
used
to
construct
V
is
an
isomorphism.
That
is
to
say,
in
this
case,
V
is
simply
the
geometric
line
bundle
associated
to
E,
and
D
⊆
V
is
its
zero
section.
Remark
3.5.2.
Some
readers
may
wonder
why,
in
Deﬁnition
2.2,
we
took
H
to
be
a
compact
set,
as
opposed
to,
say,
an
open
set
(or,
perhaps,
an
open
set
which
is,
in
some
sense,
“bounded”).
One
reason
for
this
is
the
following:
If
H
were
required
to
be
open,
then
we
would
be
obliged,
in
Example
3.5,
to
take
the
“archimedean
structure”
on
V
to
be
the
open
set
deﬁned
by
sections
of
norm
<
1.
In
particular,
if
E
is
taken
to
be
the
trivial
line
bundle,
then
it
would
follow
that
the
section
of
CATEGORIES
OF
LOG
SCHEMES
WITH
ARCHIMEDEAN
STRUCTURES
19
V
deﬁned
by
the
section
“1”
of
the
trivial
bundle
would
fail
to
deﬁne
a
morphism
in
the
“category
of
arithmetic
log
schemes”
—
a
situation
which
the
author
found
to
be
unacceptable.
Another
motivating
reason
for
Deﬁnition
2.2
comes
from
rigid
geometry:
That
is
to
say,
in
the
context
of
rigid
geometry,
perhaps
the
most
basic
example
of
an
integral
structure
on
the
aﬃne
line
Spec(Qp
[T
])
is
that
given
by
the
ring
Zp
[T
]∧
(where
the
“∧”
denotes
p-adic
completion).
Then
the
continuous
homomorphisms
Zp
[T
]∧
→
Cp
[i.e.,
the
“Cp
-valued
points
of
the
integral
structure”]
correspond
precisely
to
the
elements
of
Cp
with
absolute
value
≤
1.
def
Remark
3.5.3.
If
S
=
Spec(OF
)
[where
OF
is
the
ring
of
integers
of
a
number
ﬁeld
F
],
and
we
equip
S
with
the
log
structure
associated
to
the
chart
N

1
→
0
∈
OS
,
then
an
archimedean
structure
on
S
log
is
not
the
same
as
a
choice
of
Hermitian
metrics
on
the
trivial
line
bundle
over
OS
at
various
archimedean
primes
of
S.
This
is
somewhat
counter-intuitive,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
usual
theory
of
log
schemes.
More
generally:
The
deﬁnition
of
an
archimedean
structure
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.2]
adopted
in
this
paper
is
perhaps
not
so
satisfactory
when
one
wishes
to
consider
the
archimedean
aspects
of
log
structures
or
other
inﬁnitesimal
deformations
(e.g.,
nilpotent
thickenings)
in
detail.
For
instance,
the
possible
choices
of
an
archimedean
structure
are
invariant
with
respect
to
nilpotent
thickenings.
Thus,
depending
on
the
situation
in
which
one
wishes
to
apply
the
theory
of
the
present
paper,
it
may
be
desirable
to
modify
Definition
2.2
so
as
to
deal
with
archimedean
structures
on
log
structures
or
nilpotent
thickenings
in
a
more
satisfactory
matter
—
perhaps
by
making
use
of
the
constructions
of
Example
3.5
[including
“angular
regions”!],
applied
to
the
various
line
bundles
or
vector
bundles
that
form
the
log
structures
or
nilpotent
thickenings
under
consideration.
At
the
time
of
writing,
however,
it
is
not
clear
to
the
author
how
to
construct
such
a
theory.
Indeed,
many
of
the
complications
that
appear
to
arise
if
one
is
to
construct
such
a
theory
seem
to
be
related
to
the
fact
that
archimedean
(integral)
structures,
unlike
their
nonarchimedean
counterparts,
typically
fail
to
be
closed
under
addition.
Since,
however,
such
a
theory
is
beyond
the
scope
of
the
present
paper,
we
shall
not
discuss
this
issue
further
in
the
present
paper.
