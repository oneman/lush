We
study
the
“combinatorial
anabelian
geometry”
that
governs
the
relationship
between
the
dual
semi-graph
of
a
pointed
stable
curve
and
various
associated
proﬁnite
fundamental
groups
of
the
pointed
stable
curve.
Although
many
results
of
this
type
have
been
obtained
previously
in
various
particular
situations
of
interest
under
unnecessarily
strong
hypotheses,
the
goal
of
the
present
paper
is
to
step
back
from
such
“typical
situations
of
interest”
and
instead
to
consider
this
topic
in
the
abstract
—
a
point
of
view
which
allows
one
to
prove
results
of
this
type
in
much
greater
generality
under
very
weak
hypotheses.
Introduction
In
this
paper,
we
apply
the
language
of
anabelioids
[cf.
[Mzk5],
[Mzk7]]
to
study
the
“proﬁnite
combinatorial
group
theory”
arising
from
the
relationship
between
the
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
associated
to
a
pointed
stable
curve
[i.e.,
a
“semigraph
of
anabelioids
of
PSC-type”
—
cf.
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(i),
below
for
more
details]
and
a
certain
associated
proﬁnite
fundamental
group
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(ii)].
In
particular,
we
show
that:
(i)
The
cuspidal
portion
of
the
semi-graph
may
be
recovered
group-theoretically
from
the
associated
proﬁnite
fundamental
group,
together
with
certain
numerical
information
[roughly
speaking,
the
number
of
cusps
of
the
various
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
the
given
semi-graph
of
anabelioids]
—
cf.
Theorem
1.6,
(i).
(ii)
The
entire
“semi-graph
of
anabelioids
structure”
may
be
recovered
grouptheoretically
from
the
associated
proﬁnite
fundamental
group,
together
with
a
certain
ﬁltration
[arising
from
this
“semi-graph
of
anabelioids
structure”]
of
the
abelianizations
of
the
various
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
the
given
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
—

1.6,

Moreover,
we
show
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
“weights”
[i.e.,
logarithms
of
absolute
values
of
eigenvalues
of
the
action
of
the
Frobenius
element
of
the
Galois
group
of
a
ﬁnite
ﬁeld],
the
data
necessary
for
(i)
(respectively,
(ii))
above
may
be
recovered
from
very
weak
assumptions
concerning
the
“weights”
—
cf.
Corollary
2.7,
(i),
(ii).
In
particular,
[unlike
the
techniques
of
[Mzk4],
Lemmas
1.3.9,
2.3,
for
example]
these
very
weak
assumptions
do
not
even
require
the
existence
of
a
particular
Frobenius
element.
Alternatively,
when
there
are
no
cusps,
the
data
necessary
for
(ii)
may
be
recovered
from
very
weak
assumptions
concerning
the
ladic
inertia
action
[cf.
Corollary
2.7,
(iii)]
—
i.e.,
one
does
not
even
need
to
consider
weights.
This
sort
of
result
may
be
regarded
as
a
strengthening
of
various
results
to
the
eﬀect
that
a
curve
has
good
reduction
if
and
only
if
the
l-adic
inertia
action
is
trivial
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Tama1],
Theorem
0.8].
One
consequence
of
this
theory
is
the
result
[cf.
Corollary
2.7,
(iv)]
that
the
subgroup
of
the
group
of
outer
automorphisms
of
the
associated
fundamental
group
consisting
of
the
graphic
outer
automorphisms
[i.e.,
the
automorphisms
that
are
compatible
with
the
“semi-graph
of
anabelioids
structure”]
is
equal
to
its
own
commensurator
within
the
entire
group
of
outer
automorphisms.
This
result
may
be
regarded
as
a
sort
of
“anabelian
analogue”
of
a
well-known
“linear
algebra
fact”
concerning
the
general
linear
group
[cf.
Remark
2.7.1].
The
original
motivation
for
the
development
of
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
is
as
follows:
Frequently,
in
discussions
of
the
anabelian
geometry
of
hyperbolic
curves,
one
ﬁnds
it
necessary
to
reconstruct
the
cusps
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Naka1],
Theorem
3.4;
[Mzk4],
Lemma
1.3.9;
[Tama2],
Lemma
2.3,
Proposition
2.4]
or
the
entire
dual
semi-graph
associated
to
a
pointed
stable
curve
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk2],
§1
–
5;
[Mzk4],
Lemma
2.3]
group-theoretically
from
some
associated
proﬁnite
fundamental
group.
Moreover,
although
the
techniques
for
doing
this
in
various
diverse
situations
are
quite
similar
and
only
require
much
weaker
assumptions
than
the
assumptions
that
often
hold
in
particular
situations
of
interest,
up
till
now,
there
was
no
uniﬁed
presentation
or
general
results
concerning
this
topic
—
only
a
collection
of
papers
covering
various
“particular
situations
of
interest”.
Thus,
the
goal
of
the
present
paper
is
to
prove
results
concerning
this
topic
in
maximum
possible
generality,
in
the
hope
that
this
may
prove
useful
in
applications
to
situations
not
covered
in
previous
papers
[cf.,
e.g.,
Corollaries
2.8,
2.9,
2.10;
Remarks
2.8.1,
2.8.2].
The

would

to
thank

Tamagawa

Topological
Groups:
Let
G
be
a
Hausdorﬀ
topological
group,
and
H
⊆
G
a
closed
subgroup.
Let
us
write
def
ZG
(H)
=
{g

=

g
for
any

g

for
the
commensurator
of

in
G.
Note
that:
(i)
ZG
(H),
NG
(H)
and
CG
(H)
are
subgroups
of
G;
(ii)
we
have
inclusions
H,
ZG
(H)
⊆
NG
(H)
⊆
CG
(H)
and
(iii)
H
is

We

(respectively,

terminal
in
G
if
ZG
(H)
=

(respectively,

CG

We
shall
denote
the
group
of
automorphisms
of
G
by
Aut(G).
Conjugation
by
elements
of
G
determines
a
homomorphism
G
→
Aut(G)
whose
image
consists
of
the
inner

of
G.
We
shall
denote
by
Out(G)
the

of
Aut(G)
by
the
[normal]
subgroup
consisting
of
the
inner

Curves:
Suppose
that
g
≥
0
is
an
integer.
Then
if
S
is
a
scheme,
a
family
of
curves
of
genus
g
X→S
is
deﬁned
to
be
a
smooth,
proper,
geometrically
connected
morphism
of

X

whose
geometric

are

Suppose
that
g,
r
≥
0
are
integers
such
that
2g
−
2
+
r
>
0.
We
shall
denote
the
moduli
stack
of
r-pointed
stable
curves
of
genus
g
(where
we
assume
the
points
to
be
unordered)
by
Mg,r
[cf.
[DM],
[Knud]
for
an
exposition
of
the
theory
of
such
curves;
strictly
speaking,
[Knud]
treats
the
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
Mg,r
determined
by
ordering
the
marked
points].
The
open
substack
Mg,r
⊆
Mg,r
of
smooth
curves
will
be
referred
to
as
the
moduli
stack
of
smooth
r-pointed
stable
curves
of
genus
g
or,
alternatively,
as
the
moduli
stack
of
hyperbolic
curves
of
type
(g,
r).
The
divisor
at
inﬁnity
Mg,r
\Mg,r
of
Mg,r
determines
a
log
structure
on
Mg,r
;
denote
the
log
resulting
log
stack
by
Mg,r
.
A
family
of
hyperbolic
curves
of
type
(g,
r)
X→S
is
deﬁned
to
be
a
morphism
which
factors
X
→
Y
→
S
as
the
composite
of
an
open
immersion
X
→
Y
onto
the
complement
Y
\D
of
a
relative
divisor
D
⊆
Y
which
is
ﬁnite
étale
over
S
of
relative
degree
r,
and
a
family
Y
→
S
of
curves
of
genus
g.
One
checks
easily
that,
if
S
is
normal,
then
the
pair
(Y,
D)
is
unique
up
to
canonical
isomorphism.
(Indeed,
when
S
is
the
spectrum
of
a
ﬁeld,
this
fact
is
well-known
from
the
elementary
theory
of
algebraic
curves.
Next,
we
consider
an
arbitrary
connected
normal
S
on
which
a
prime
l
is
invertible
(which,
by
Zariski
localization,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality).
Denote
by
S

→
S
the
ﬁnite
étale
covering
parametrizing
orderings
of
the
marked
points
and
trivializations
of
the
l-torsion
points
of
the
Jacobian
of
Y
.
Note
that
S

→
S
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
(Y,
D),
since
(by
the
normality
of
S),
S

may
be
constructed
as
the
normalization
of
S
in
the
function
ﬁeld
of
S

(which
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
(Y,
D),
since
the
restriction
of
(Y,
D)
to
the
generic
point
of
S
has
already
been
shown
to
be
unique).
Thus,
the
uniqueness
of
(Y,
D)
follows
by
considering
the
classifying
morphism
(associated
to
(Y,
D))
from
S

to
the
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
(Mg,r
)Z[1/l]
parametrizing
orderings
of
the
marked
points
and
trivializations
of
the
l-torsion
points
of
the
Jacobian
[since
this
covering
is
well-known
to
be
a
scheme,
for
l
suﬃciently
large].)
We
shall
refer
to
Y
(respectively,
D;
D;
D)
as
the
compactiﬁcation
(respectively,
divisor
at
inﬁnity;
divisor
of

of
X.
A
family
of
hyperbolic
curves
X

is
deﬁned
to
be
a
morphism
X

S
such
that
the
restriction
of
this
morphism
to
each

component
of
S
is
a
family
of
hyperbolic
curves
of
type
(g,
r)
for
some
integers
(g,
r)
as
above.
Write
C
g,r
→
Mg,r
for
the
tautological
curve
over
Mg,r
;
Dg,r
⊆
Mg,r
for
the
corresponding
tautological
divisor
of
marked
points.
The
divisor
given
by
the
union
of
D
g,r
with
the
inverse
image
in
C
g,r
of
the
divisor
at
inﬁnity
of
Mg,r
determines
a
log
structure
on
C
g,r
;
log
denote
the
resulting
log
stack
by
C
g,r
.
Thus,
we
obtain
a

of

we

a

as

If
C
has
no

then
we
shall
refer
to

as
a

If

is
a

then
we

Section

Criterion
for
Graphicity
In
the
present
§1,
we
state
and
prove
a
criterion
for
an
isomorphism
between
the
proﬁnite
fundamental
groups
of
pointed
stable
curves
to
arise
from
an
isomorphism
of
[semi-]graphs
of
groups.
To
do
this,
we
shall
ﬁnd
it
convenient
to
use
the
language
of
anabelioids
[cf.
[Mzk5]],
together
with
the
theory
of
semi-graphs
of
anabelioids
of
[Mzk7].
Let
Σ
be
a
nonempty
set
of
prime
numbers.
Denote
by
Σ
Z
the
pro-Σ
completion
of
Z.
Let
G
be
a
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
[cf.
[Mzk7],
Deﬁnition
2.1],
whose
underlying
semi-graph
we
denote
by
G.
Thus,
for
each
vertex
v
(respectively,
edge
e)
of
G,
we
are
given
a
connected
anabelioid
[i.e.,
a
Galois
category]
Gv
(respectively,
Ge
),
and
for
each
branch
b
of
an
edge
e
abutting
to
a
vertex
v,
we
are
given
a
morphism
of
anabelioids
Ge
→
Gv
.
Deﬁnition
1.1.
(i)
We
shall
refer
to
G
as
being
of
pro-Σ
PSC-type
[i.e.,
“pointed
stable
curve
type”]
if
it
arises
as
the
pro-Σ
completion
[cf.
[Mzk7],
Deﬁnition
2.9,
(ii)]
of
the
semigraph
of
anabelioids
determined
by
the
“dual
semi-graph
of
proﬁnite
groups
with
c
compact
structure”
[i.e.,
the
object
denoted
“GX
”
in
the
discussion
of
pointed
stable
curves
in
[Mzk4],
Appendix]
of
a
pointed
stable
curve
over
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
whose
characteristic
∈
Σ.
[Thus,
the
vertices
(respectively,
closed
edges;
open
edges)
of
G
correspond
to
the
irreducible
components
(respectively,
nodes;
cusps
[i.e.,
marked
points])
of
the
pointed
stable
curve.]
We
shall
refer
to
G
as
being
of
PSCtype
if
it
is
of
pro-Σ
PSC-type
for
some
nonempty
set
of
prime
numbers
Σ.
If
G
is
a
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
of
PSC-type,
then
we
shall
refer
to
the
open
(respectively,
closed)
edges
of
the
underlying
semi-graph
G
of
G
as
the
cusps
(respectively,
nodes)
of
G
[or
G]
and
write
r(G)
(respectively,
n(G))
for
the
cardinality
of
the
set
of
cusps
(respectively,
nodes)
of
G;
if
r(G)
=
0
(respectively,
n(G)
=
0),
then
we
shall
say
that
G
is
noncuspidal
(respectively,
nonnodal).
Also,
we
shall
write
i(G)
for
the
cardinality
of
the
set
of
vertices
of
G.
(ii)
Suppose
that
G
is
of
pro-Σ
PSC-type.
Then
we
shall
denote
by
ΠG
and
refer
to
as
the
PSC-fundamental
group
of
G
the
maximal
pro-Σ
quotient
of
the
proﬁnite
fundamental
group
of
G
[cf.
[Mzk7],
the
discussion
following
Deﬁnition
2.2];
we
shall
refer
to
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
G
that
arises
from
an
open
subgroup
of
ΠG
as
a
[ﬁnite
étale]
ΠG
-covering
of
G.
A
vertex
(respectively,
edge)
of
G
determines,
up
to
conjugation,
a
closed
subgroup
of
ΠG
;
we
shall
refer
to
such
subgroups
as
verticial
(respectively,
edge-like).
An
edge-like
subgroup
that
arises
from
a

will
be
referred

will
be
referred

Write
MG
for

Then
the

determine

of

the
condition
that

[Indeed,
this

In

one
veriﬁes
immediately

Proof.
First,
we
observe
that
assertion
(ii)
follows
formally
from
assertion
(i)
[cf.
the
derivation
of
[Mzk7],
Corollary
2.7,
(i),
from
[Mzk7],
Proposition
2.6].
Now
the
proof
of
assertion
(i)
is
entirely
similar
to
the
proof
of
[Mzk7],
Proposition
2.6:
That
is
to
say,
upon
translating
the
group-theory
of
ΠG
into
the
language
of
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
G
and
possibly
replacing
G
by
some
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
G
[which
allows
us,
in
particular,
to
replace
the
words
“open
in”
in
assertion
(i)
by
the
words
“equal
to”],
one
sees
that
to
prove
assertions
(i),
(ii),
it
suﬃces
to
prove,
under
the
further
assumption
that
G
is
sturdy
[cf.
Remark
1.1.5],
that
if
v1
=
v2
(respectively,

e1
=
e2
),
then
there
exists
a
ﬁnite
étale

(respectively,

covering
G

G
whose
restriction
to
the

Gv2
(respectively,

is
trivial
[i.e.,
isomorphic
to
a

union
of
copies
of
Gv2
(respectively,

but
whose
restriction
to
the
anabelioid
Gv1
(respectively,

)
is
nontrivial.
But,
in
light
of
our
assumption
that
G
is
sturdy,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
by
gluing
together
appropriate
ﬁnite
étale

one
may
construct

perfect
pairing,
the
submultiplication
by
a
unit
of
Z
edge
vert
modules
MG
,
MG
of
MG
are
mutual
annihilators.
Proof.
Since
G
is
noncuspidal,
it
follows
[cf.
Remark
1.1.3]
that
ΠG
is
the
pro-Σ
fundamental
group
of
some
compact
Riemann
surface,
so
the
existence
of
a
perfect
pairing
as
asserted
follows
from
the
well-known
Poincaré
duality
of
such
a
compact
Riemann
surface.
To
see
that
the
submodules
MGedge
,
MGvert
of
MG
are
mutual
annihilators,
we
reason
as
follows:
Since
the
isomorphism
class
of
G
is
manifestly
determined
by
purely
combinatorial
data,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
[by
possibly
replacing
G
by
the
“pro-Σ
completion”
of
G,
for
some
subset
Σ
⊆
Σ]
that
G
arises
from
a
stable
curve
over
a
ﬁnite
ﬁeld
k
whose
characteristic
∈
Σ.
Write
q
for
the
cardinality
of
k;
Gk
for
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
k.
We
shall
say
that
an

Σ
-module
is
of
weight
w
if
the
eigenvalues
action
of
Gk
on
a
ﬁnitely
generated,
free
Z
of
the
Frobenius
element
∈
Gk
are
algebraic
integers
all
of
whose
complex
absolute
values
are
equal
to
q
w/2
.
Now
one
has
a
natural
action
of
Gk
on
G
[cf.
Remark
2.5.1
below
for
a
more
detailed
description
of
this
action],
and
hence
a
natural
action
on
MG
which
preserves
MGedge
,
MGvert
.
By
replacing
k
by
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
k,
we
may
assume
that
Gk
acts
trivially
on
the
underlying
semi-graph
G.
Thus,
the
action
of
Gk
on
MG
/MGvert
(respectively,
MGedge
)
is
trivial
[cf.
Remark
1.1.3]
(respectively,
of
weight
2).
On
the
other
hand,
by
the
“Riemann
hypothesis”
for
abelian
varieties
over
ﬁnite
ﬁelds
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Mumf],
p.
206],
it
follows
[cf.
Remark
1.1.4]
that
the
action
of
Gk
on
MGvert
/MGedge
is
of
weight
1.
Note,
moreover,
that
the

Σ
)
is
of
weight
−2.
[Indeed,
this
follows
by
considering
action
of
Gk
on

[applied

G

obtained
by
“compactifying”

cf.

it
follows
that

Moreover,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
if
G
has

then
the
rank

is
equal

Also,
[again

it

that,
if,
in

(a)
α

(b)
α

(c)
α

Let

Let

assume
further
that
this

is
a

totally
ramiﬁed
ΠG
-
(respectively,
ΠG

covering,
and
that
G
is
arbitrary
(respectively,

sturdy).
Let
e
(respectively,

v)
be
a
cusp
(respectively,
node;

of
G
such
that
G

→
G
restricts
to
a
connected
covering
of
Ge
(respectively,
Ge

Then
observe
that:

There
exists
a
ﬁnite
étale
ΠG

(respectively,
ΠG

Πunr

covering
G

such
that:
(a)



G
and
G

→
G
is
cuspidally
(respectively,
nodally;
verticially)
purely
totally
ramiﬁed.
Indeed,
the
construction
of
such
a
covering
is
immediate
[cf.
the
proof
of
Proposition
1.2].
Remark
1.4.4.
Let
G

→
G
be
as
in
Remark
1.4.2;
assume
further
that
this
covering
is
cyclic,
and
that
G
is
noncuspidal.
Then
it
is
immediate
that
G

→
G
is
module-wise
nodal
if
and
only
if
it
is
nodally
totally
ramiﬁed.
In
particular,
it
follows
that:
(i)
Any
closed
subgroup
B
⊆
ΠG
is
contained
in
some
nodal
edge-like
subgroup
if
and
only
if,
for
every
open
normal
subgroup
B

⊆
B,
the
inclusion
B

⊆
B
descends
to
a
module-wise
nodal
ﬁnite
étale
covering.
(ii)
A
closed
subgroup
A
⊆
ΠG
is
a
nodal
edge-like
subgroup
of
ΠG
if
and
only
if
it
satisﬁes
the
condition
of
(i)
above
[i.e.,
where
one
takes
“B”
to
be
A],
and,
moreover,
is
maximal
among
closed
subgroups
B
⊆
ΠG
satisfying
the
condition
of
(i).
Indeed,
the
necessity
of
(i)
is
immediate.
The
suﬃciency
of
(i)
follows
by
observing
that
since
the
set
of
nodes
of
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
G
is
always
ﬁnite,
an
exhaustive
collection
of
open
normal
subgroups
of
B
thus
determines
—
by
considering
the
nodes
at
which
the
“total
ramiﬁcation”
occurs
—
[at
least
one]
compatible
system
of
nodes
of
the
ﬁnite
étale
ΠG
-coverings
of
G;
but
this
implies
that
B
is
contained
in
some
nodal
edge-like
subgroup.
In
light
of
(i),
the
necessity
of
(ii)
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions
and
Proposition
1.2,
(i)
[which
implies
maximality],
while
the
suﬃciency
of
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
the
assumption
of
maximality.
Proposition
1.5.
(Incidence
Relations)
We
maintain
the
notation
of
Deﬁnition
1.4.
Then
the
following
hold.
(i)
An
edge-like
subgroup
of
ΠG
is
cuspidal
(respectively,
not
cuspidal)
if
and
only
if
it
is
contained
in
precisely
one
(respectively,
precisely
two)
verticial
subgroup(s).

(ii)
α
is
graphic
if
and
only
if
it
is
group-theoretically
edge-like
and
group-theoretically
verticial.
Moreover,
in
this
case,
α
arises
from
a
unique
∼
isomorphism
of
semi-graphs
of
anabelioids
G
→
H.
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
Observe
that
it
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
a
cuspidal
(respectively,
noncuspidal)
edge-like
subgroup
of
ΠG
is
contained
in
at
least
one
(respectively,
at
least
two)
verticial
subgroup(s).
To
prove
that
these
lower
bounds
also
serve
as
upper
bounds,
it
suﬃces
[by
possibly
replacing
G
by
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
G]
to
show
that
if
e
is
a
cuspidal
(respectively,
nodal)
edge
of
G
that
does
not
abut
to
a
vertex
v,
then
there
exists
a
ﬁnite
étale
ΠG
-covering
G

→
G
which
is
trivial
over
Gv
,
but
nontrivial
over
Ge
.
But
this
is
immediate
[cf.
the
proof
of
Proposition
1.2,
(i)].
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
Necessity
is
immediate.
To
prove
suﬃciency,
we
reason
as
follows:
The
assumption
that
α
is
group-theoretically
edge-like
and
group-theoretically
verticial
implies,
by
considering
conjugacy
classes
of
verticial
and
edge-like
subgroups
[and
applying
Proposition
1.2,
(i)],
that
α
induces
a
bijection
between
the
vertices
(respectively,
edges)
of
the
underlying
semi-graphs
G,
H.
By
assertion
(i),
this
bijection
maps
cuspidal
(respectively,
nodal)
edges
to
cuspidal
(respectively,
nodal)
edges
and
is
compatible
with
the
various
“incidence
relations”
that
deﬁne
the
semi-graph
structure
[i.e.,
the
data
of
which
vertices
an
edge
abuts
∼
to].
Thus,
α
induces
an
isomorphism
of
semi-graphs
G
→
H.
Finally,
by
Proposition
∼
1.2,
(ii),
one
concludes
that
α
arises
from
a
unique
isomorphism
G
→
H,
as
desired.

Theorem
1.6.
(Criterion
for
Graphicity)
We
maintain
the
notation
of
Deﬁnition
1.4.
Then
the
following
hold.
(i)
α
is
numerically
cuspidal
if
and
only
if
it
is
group-theoretically
cuspidal.
(ii)
α
is
graphic
if
and
only
if
it
is
graphically
ﬁltration-preserving.
(iii)
Assume
that
G,
H
are
sturdy.
Then
β
is
verticially
ﬁltration-preserving
if
and
only
if
it
is
group-theoretically
verticial.
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
Suﬃciency
is
immediate
[cf.
Proposition
1.2,
(i)].
The
proof
of
necessity
is
entirely
similar
to
the
latter
half
of
the
proof
of
[Mzk4],
Lemma
1.3.9:
Let
l
∈
Σ
[where
G,
H
are
of
pro-Σ
PSC-type].
Since
the
cuspidal
edge-like
subgroups
may
be
recovered
as
the
stabilizers
of
cusps
of
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
G,
H,
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
α
induces
a
functorial
bijection
between
the
sets
of
cusps
of
G,
H.
In
particular,
we
may
assume,
without
loss
of
generality,
that
Σ
=
{l}.
Then
given
pairs
of
ﬁnite
étale
ΠG

or
ΠH

correspond

α

such
that
G

is
Galois
over
G

,
and
H
is
Galois
over
H
,
it
follows
from
the
assumption
that
α
is
numerically
cuspidal
that
G

→
G

is
cuspidally
purely
totally
ramiﬁed
if
and
only
if
H
→
H
is
[cf.
Remark
1.4.2].
Now
observe
that
the
cuspidal
edge-like
subgroups
of
ΠG
(respectively,
ΠH
)
are
precisely
the
maximal
closed
subgroups
A
such
that,
for
every
open
normal
subgroup
A
⊆
A,
the
inclusion
A
⊆
A
descends
to
a
cuspidally
purely
totally
ramiﬁed
Galois
ﬁnite
étale
covering.
Indeed,
in
light
of
Remark
1.4.3
[which
implies
that,
in
the
preceding
sentence,
one
may
remove
the
word
“purely”
without
aﬀecting
the
validity
of
the
assertion
contained
in
this
sentence],
this
follows
by
a
similar
argument
to
the
argument
applied
in
the
case
of
nodes
in
Remark
1.4.4.
Thus,
we
thus
conclude
that
α
is
group-theoretically
cuspidal,
as
desired.
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
Necessity
is
immediate.
To
prove
suﬃciency,
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
by
functoriality;
Proposition
1.2,
(ii);
Proposition
1.5,
(ii),
it
follows
that
we
may
always
replace
G,
H
by
ﬁnite
étale
ΠG
-
or
ΠH
-coverings
that
correspond
via
α.
In
particular,
by
Remark
1.1.5,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
G,
H
are
sturdy.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
by
Proposition
1.3
[cf.
Remark
1.3.1],
the
assumption
that
α
is
graphically
ﬁltration-preserving
implies
that
α
is
numerically
cuspidal,
hence
[by
assertion
(i)]
that
α
is
group-theoretically
cuspidal.
Thus,
by
replacing
G,
H
by
their
respective
compactiﬁcations
[cf.
Remark
1.1.6],
and
replacing
α
by
the
isomorphism
induced
by
α
between
the
respective
cpt
quotients
ΠG

Πcpt
G
,
ΠH

ΠH
,
we
may
assume,
without
loss
of
generality,
that
G,
H
are
noncuspidal
and
sturdy.
Also,
as
in
the
proof
of
assertion
(i),
we
may
assume
that
Σ
=
{l}.
Now
by
Proposition
1.5,
(ii),
it
suﬃces
to
prove
that
α
is
group-theoretically
edge-like
and
group-theoretically
verticial.
But
by
Remark
1.4.4,
the
assumption
that
α
is
edge-wise
ﬁltration-preserving
implies
that
α
is
grouptheoretically
edge-like.
In
particular,
α
induces
a
verticially
ﬁltration-preserving
∼
isomorphism
Πunr
→
Πunr
G
H
.
Now
to
prove
that
α
is
group-theoretically
verticial,
it
suﬃces
to
prove
[cf.
the
proof
of
assertion
(i)]
that
α
induces
a
functorial
bijection
between
the
sets
of
vertices
of
G,
H.
Thus,
to
complete
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii),
it
suﬃces
to
prove
that
β
is
group-theoretically
verticial,
that
is
to
say,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
assertion
(iii).
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
Suﬃciency
is
immediate.
On
the
other
hand,
necessity
follows
from
Remark
1.4.2,
by
observing
that
the
unramiﬁed
verticial
subgroups
are
precisely
the
maximal
closed
subgroups
A
of
Πunr
or
Πunr
G
H
such


that,
for
every
open
normal
subgroup
A
⊆
A,
the
inclusion
A
⊆
A
descends
to
a
verticially
purely
totally
ramiﬁed
Galois
ﬁnite
étale
covering.
Indeed,
in
light
of
Remark
1.4.3
[which
implies
that,
in
the
preceding
sentence,
one
may
remove
the
word
“purely”

this
follows
by
a
similar

to
the

This
completes
the

(ii).

Remark

The

Section

The
Group
of
Graphic
Outer
Automorphisms
In
this
§,
we
study
the
consequences
of
the
theory
of
§1
for
the
group
of
automorphisms
of
a
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
of
PSC-type.
Let
G
be
a
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
of
pro-Σ
PSC-type
[with
underlying
semigraph
G].
In
the
following
discussion,
G,
G
will
remain
ﬁxed
until
further
notice
to
the
contrary
[in
Corollary
2.7].
Denote
by
Aut(G)
the
group
of
automorphisms
of
the
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
G.
Here,
we
recall
that
an
automorphism
of
a
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
consists
of
an
automorphism
of
the
underlying
semi-graph,
together
with
a
compatible
system
of
isomorphisms
between
the
various
anabelioids
at
each
of
the
vertices
and
edges
of
the
underlying
semi-graph,
which
are
compatible
with
the
various
morphisms
of
anabelioids
associated
to
the
branches
of
the
underlying
semi-graph
—
cf.
[Mzk7],
Deﬁnition
2.1;
[Mzk7],
Remark
2.4.2.
Then,
by
Proposition
1.5,
(ii),
we
obtain
an
injective
homomorphism
Aut(G)
→
Out(ΠG
)
whose
image
we
shall
denote
by
Outgrph
(ΠG
)
⊆
Out(ΠG
)
and
refer
to
as
the
group
of
graphic
outer
automorphisms
of
ΠG
.
Since
ΠG
is
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated
[cf.
Remark
1.1.3],
it
follows
that
Out(ΠG
)
is
equipped
with
a
natural
proﬁnite
topology,
which
thus
induces
a
natural
topology
on
the
subgroup
Outgrph
(ΠG
)
⊆
Out(ΠG
),
which
is
manifestly
closed,
by
Proposition
1.5,
(ii).
In
particular,
Aut(G)
∼
=
Outgrph
(ΠG
)
is
equipped
with
a
natural
proﬁnite
topology.
Since
ΠG
is
center-free
[cf.
Remark
1.1.3],
we
have
a
natural
exact
sequence
1
→
ΠG
→
Aut(ΠG
)
→
Out(ΠG
)
→
1,
which
we
may
pull-back
via
Aut(G)
→
Out(ΠG
)
to
obtain
an
exact
sequence
as
follows:
1
→
ΠG
→
ΠAut

then
there
is
a

In

we
obtain,
for

a

Proof.
To
verify
the
asserted
independence
of
covering,
it
suﬃces
to
observe
that
any
two
sturdy
ΠG
-coverings
G

→
G,
G

→
G
may
be
dominated
by
a
third
sturdy
ΠG

G


G,
which
induce

(ΠG

⊗
Q
which
are
compatible
with
the
various
actions
by
ΠAut
G
.
To
show
that
the
action
of
ΠAut
factors
through
Aut(G),
we
may
assume
G
without
loss
of
generality
that
Σ
is
the
set
of
all
primes.
On
the
other
hand,
by
the
independence
of
covering
already
veriﬁed,
it
follows
that
we
may
compute
the

ΠAut
G
-action
in
question
by
using
a
covering
G
→
G
of
degree
prime
to
l(l−1).
Since
the
action
in
question
amounts
to
a
continuous
homomorphism
ΠAut
→
Z×
G
l
which
Aut

clearly
factors
through
ΠG
/ΠG
,
the
desired
factorization
follows
from
the
fact
that
[consideration
of
orders
implies
that]
every
homomorphism
Gal(G

/G)
→
Z×
l
is
trivial.

Proposition
2.2.
(The
Double
of
a
Semi-Graph
of
Anabelioids
of
PSCtype)
Suppose
that
r(G)
=
0.
Let
H
be
the
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
deﬁned
as
follows:
The
underlying
semi-graph
H
is
obtained
by
taking
the
disjoint
union
of
two
copies
of
G
and,
for
each
cusp
e
of
G
abutting
to
a
vertex
v
of
G,
replacing
the
corresponding
pairs
of
cusps
lying
in
these
two
copies
of
G
by
a
node
[i.e.,
a
closed
edge]
that
joins
the
pairs
of
vertices
corresponding
to
v
in
these
two
copies.
We
shall
refer
to
the
newly
appended
nodes
as
bridges.
Away
from
the
bridges,
we
take
the
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
structure
of
H
to
be
the
structure
induced
by
G,
and,
at
each
branch
of
a
bridge
of
H,
we
take
the
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
structure
of
H
to
be
the
structure
induced
by
G
at
the
corresponding
cusp
e
of
G,
by
gluing
the
two
copies
of
Ge
in
question
by
means
of
the
inversion
automorphism
Ge
→
Ge
[induced
by
“multiplication
by
−1”
on
the
abelian
fundamental
group
of
Ge
].
We
shall
refer
to
H
as
the
double
of
G.
Then
the
following
hold.
(i)
H
is
a
noncuspidal
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
of
PSC-type.
(ii)
Restriction
of
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
H
to
each
of
the
copies
of
G
used
to
construct
H
determines
a
natural
injective
continuous
outer
homomorphism
ΠG
→
ΠH
.
(iii)
The
homomorphism
of
(ii)
maps
verticial
(respectively,
edge-like)
subgroups
of
ΠG
isomorphically
onto
verticial
(respectively,
edge-like)
subgroups
of
ΠH
.
(iv)
The
homomorphism
of
(ii)
induces
an
injection
MG
→
MH
edge
vert
that
maps
MGedge
(respectively,
MGvert
)
into
MH
(respectively,
MH
).
Proof.
Assertion
(i)
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions.
Note,
relative
to
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(i),
that
there
is
a
corresponding
construction
of
a
“double”
of
a
pointed
stable
A
COMBINATORIAL
VERSION
OF

17
curve.
This
explains
the
need
for
“gluing
by
means
of
the
inversion
automorphism”
in
the
deﬁnition
of
H:
Over,
say,
a
complete
discrete
valuation
ring
A
with
algebraically
closed
residue
ﬁeld,
the
completion
of
a
generically
smooth
pointed
stable
curve
at
a
node
is
isomorphic
to
the
formal
spectrum
of
the
complete
local
ring
A[[x,
y]]/(xy
−
s),
where
x,
y
are
indeterminates
and
s
lies
in
the
maximal
ideal
of
A.
Then
the
action
of
the
local
tame
Galois
group
at
each
of
the
branches
of
the
node
considered
independently
is
of
the
form
x
→
ζ
·
x,
y
→
ζ
·
y,
where
ζ
is
some
root
of
unity.
On
the
other
hand,
since
the
Galois
action
on
coverings
of
the
entire
formal
spectrum
of
A[[x,
y]]/(xy
−
s)
[i.e.,
where
one
does
not
treat
the
branches
of
the
node
independently]
necessarily
ﬁxes
elements
of
the
base
ring
[i.e.,
the
normalization
of
A
in
some
ﬁnite
extension
of
its
quotient
ﬁeld],
it
follows
that
this
action
must
be
of
the
form
x
→
ζ
·
x,
y
→
ζ
−1
·
y.
As
for
assertion
(ii),
it
is
immediate
that
we
obtain
a
natural
homomorphism
ΠG
→
ΠH
.
The
asserted
injectivity
may
be
veriﬁed
as
follows
[cf.
also
the
proof
of
injectivity
in
[Mzk7],
Proposition
2.5,
(i)]:
Given
any
ﬁnite
étale
ΠG
-covering
G

→
G,
one
may
construct
a
ﬁnite
étale
ΠH
-covering
H
→
H
which
induces
G

→
G
via
the
“restriction
procedure”
of
(ii)
by
gluing
together
two
copies
of
G

over
the
two
copies
of
G
used
to
construct
H.
Note
that
to
carry
out
this
gluing,
one
must
choose
a
[noncanonical!]
isomorphism,
at
each
cusp
e
of
G,
between
the
restriction
of
G

→
G
to
Ge
and
the
pull-back
via
the
inversion
automorphism
of
this
restriction.
[Note
that
it
is
immediate
that
such
an
isomorphism
always
exists.]
Assertion
(iii)
is
immediate
from
the
construction
of
the
double.
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iv).
To
verify
that
the
homomorphism
MG
→
MH
induced
by
the
homomorphism
of
(ii)
is
an
injection,
it
suﬃces
to
observe
that
the
gluing
procedure
discussed
in
the
proof
of
the
injectivity
of
(ii)
determines
a
splitting
of
the
homomorphism
MG
→
MH
.
Indeed,
if
the
ﬁnite
étale
ΠG
-covering
G

→
G
in
question
is
abelian,
with
Galois
group
A,
then
the
resulting
H
→
H
admits
a
natural
action
by
A,
by
letting
A
act
via
the
identity
A
→
A
on
one
copy
of
G

and
via
“multiplication
by
−1”
A
→
A
on
the
other
copy
of
G

.
[Put
another
way,
if
we
think
of
the
covering
G

→
G
as
corresponding
to
the
A-set
A,
then
we
glue
the
set
A
to
the
set
A
at
the
bridges
by
means
of
the
automorphism
“multiplication
by
−1”.]
This
completes
the
proof
of
injectivity.
The
fact
that
this
edge
vert
injection
maps
MGedge
(respectively,
MGvert
)
into
MH
(respectively,
MH
)
follows
immediately
from
assertion
(iii).

Remark
2.2.1.
[Asada].
Certain
aspects
of
Proposition
2.2
are
related
to
the
results
of
Remark
2.2.2.
It
is
quite
possible
that
various
aspects
of
Proposition
2.2
may
be
generalized
from
the
case
of
“two
copies
of
G”
treated
in
Proposition
2.2
to
the
case
of
gluing
together
arbitrary
ﬁnite
collections
of
semi-graphs
of
anabelioids
of
PSC-type.
This
topic,
however,
lies
beyond
the
scope
of
the
present
paper.
Deﬁnition

Let

We

If

the

That
is
to
say,
the

if
the

We

on

We

If,

We

if
the

Suppose
that

Then
it

If

Remark
2.3.1.
The
purpose
of
the
introduction
of
the
notion
“l-cyclotomically
full”
is
to
allow
us
to
describe,
in
compact
form,
that
situation
in
which
it
makes
sense
to
speak
of
“weights”
in
a
fashion
similar
to
the
case
where
the
action
of
J
arises
from
scheme
theory.
Once
it
makes
sense
to
speak
of
“weights”,
one
may
introduce
the
notion
of
“l-graphically
full”
(respectively,
“weakly
l-graphically
full”),
which
asserts,
in
essence,
that
the
weights
behave
as
one
would
expect
in
the
case
of
precisely
one
(respectively,
at
least
one,
i.e.,
possibly
two
nested,
as
in
the
situations
of
Corollaries

of
the
hypothetical

Proposition

(Quasi-triviality

Let

In
particular,
if

then
the

Then
a

Q-cyclotomic
if
and
only
if
it
admits
a
positive
power
that
coincides
with
the
aψ

power
of
the
character
obtained
by
the
natural
action
of

for
some

Suppose
further
that

is

Then
a
Q-cyclotomic

is
positive
(respectively,
null;
negative)
if
and
only
if
aψ
may
be
taken
to
be

(respectively,

Finally,
any
two
Q-cyclotomic


J

the

necessarily
coincide
on
some
open
subgroup

Then
for

Proof.
Assertion
(i)
follows
immediately
from
Remarks
1.1.3,
1.1.4.
Now
when
G
is
noncuspidal,
assertion
(ii)
follows
from
assertion
(i);
Proposition
1.3.
For
arbitrary
G,
assertion
(ii)
follows
from
assertion
(ii)
in
the
noncuspidal
case,
together
with
Proposition
2.2,
(iv).
Assertion
(iii)
follows
immediately
from
assertion
(ii)
[applied
to
MGcusp
⊗Zl
];
Proposition
1.3
[applied
to
(MG
/MGcusp
)⊗Zl
,
which
is
possible
in
light
of
the
sturdiness
assumption
—
cf.
Remark
1.1.6].
Assertion
(iv)
follows
formally
from
assertion
(iii);
the
deﬁnitions;
the
fact
that
Z×
l
contains
a
torsion-free
open
subgroup.
To
verify
assertion
(v),
it
suﬃces
to
consider
the
case
where
G
arises
from
a
pointed
stable
curve
over
a
ﬁnite
ﬁeld
k
[cf.
the
proof
of
Proposition
1.3],
and
J
is
equal
to
an
open
subgroup
of
Aut(G).
Then
assertion
(v)
follows
from
the
fact
that
[in
the
notation
and
terminology
of
loc.
cit.]
the
action
of
Gk
on
MGvert
/MGedge
is
of
weight
1.
Assertion
(vi)
follows
from
assertion
(ii);
Proposition
1.3,
applied
to
the
compactiﬁcation
[cf.
Remark
1.1.6]
of
a
sturdy
ﬁnite
étale
ΠG
-covering
of
G.
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(vii).
Suppose
that
ΠG

⊆
ΠG
is
an
open
subgroup
=
0
[cf.
Remark
1.3.1],
so
[by
assertion
(ii)]
such
that
r(G

)
≥
2.
Thus,
MGcusp


def
def
/MGedge
⊗
Zl
),
0,
2
∈
EG

=
{0}
wl
(MG

⊗
Zl
).
Thus,
if
we
set
EG

=
wl
(MGvert



then
[by
assertions,
(i),
(ii)],
it
follows
that
EG

=
{0,
2}
EG

.
Moreover,
by
Proposition
1.3
[applied
to
the
compactiﬁcation
[cf.
Remark
1.1.6]
of
G],
EG

is
invariant
with
respect
to
the
automorphism
λ
→
2
−
λ
of
Q.
But
this
implies
the
desired
invariance
of
EG

with
respect
to
this
automorphism
of
Q.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(vii).
Finally,
assertions
(viii),
(ix)
follow
immediately
from
assertions
(i),
(ii);
the
deﬁnitions.

Let

Let
T

i.e.,
the

T
of

is
of
the

T

where

a

the

the

arises
from
the
natural

Thus,
if
we
write

then
we

Now
the

discussed
in

in

It
follows,
in

from
this

that,
if

the

is
the

then
the

Moreover,
if

a

that

and
we
denote
by

then
the
maximal
pro-Σ
quotient
of
ΔX

may
be
naturally
identiﬁed
with
the

In

one
obtains
a

we
obtain

Remark

Note
that
from
the
point

one
may
think
of
the

as
the

Proposition
2.6.
(The
Logarithmic
Inertia
Action)
In
the
notation
of
Example
2.5,
Iklog
acts
quasi-unipotently
[i.e.,
an
open
subgroup
of
Iklog
acts
unipotently]
on
MG
⊗
Zl
,
and,
moreover,
the
submodule
MGvert
⊗
Zl
⊆
MG
⊗
Zl
is
the
maximal
quasi-trivial
Zl
[Iklog
]-submodule
of
MG
⊗
Zl
[i.e.,
the
maximal
submodule
on
which
some
open
subgroup
of
Iklog
acts
trivially].
Proof.
Let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
if
G
is
noncuspidal,
then
the
asserted
quasiunipotency
(respectively,
quasi-triviality)
of
the
action
of
Iklog
on
MG
⊗
Zl
(respectively,
MGvert
⊗
Zl
)
follows
immediately
from
the
well-known
theory
of
Galois
actions
on
torsion
points
of
degenerating
abelian
varieties
[cf.,
e.g.,
[FC],
Chapter
III,
Corollary
7.3;
here,
we
note
that,
in
the
terminology
of
loc.
cit.,
the
submodule
MGvert
⊗
Zl
corresponds
to
the
submodule
determined
by
the
“Raynaud
extension”].
Thus,
one
obtains
the
asserted
quasi-unipotency/quasi-triviality
in
the
case
of
not
necessarily
noncuspidal
G
by
applying
the
theory
of
the
“double”
[cf.
Proposition
2.2,
(iv)].
Now
it
remains
to
prove
the
asserted
maximality.
But
this
follows
again
from
[FC],
Chapter
III,
Corollary
7.3
[i.e.,
the
fact
that
the
period
matrix
of
a
degenerating
abelian
variety
is
always
nondegenerate].

Now,
by
combining
Theorem
1.6
with
the
theory
of
the
present
§2
[cf.,
in
particular,
Proposition
2.4],
we
obtain
the
following
result.
Corollary
2.7.
(Graphicity)
Let
G,
H
be
semi-graphs
of
anabelioids
of
pro-Σ
PSC-type;
JG
→
Aut(G),
JH
→
Aut(H)
continuous
homomorphisms.
Suppose,
moreover,
that
we
have
been
given
isomorphisms
of
proﬁnite
groups
∼
α
:
ΠG
→
ΠH
;
∼
ι
:
JG
→
JH
which
are
compatible,
with
respect
to
the
respective
outer
actions
of
JG
,
JH
on
ΠG
,
ΠH
.
Then,
for
l
∈
Σ:
(i)
Suppose
that
the
respective
actions
of
JG
,
JH
on
G,
H
are
l-cyclotomically
full.
Then
α
is
group-theoretically
cuspidal.
(ii)
Suppose
that
the
respective
actions
of
JG
,
JH
on
G,
H
are
l-graphically
full
[cf.,
e.g.,
Proposition
2.4,
(v)].
Then
α
is
graphic.

(iii)
Suppose
that
the
respective
actions
of
JG
,
JH
on
G,
H
arise
from
data
as
in
Example
2.5;
that
G,
H
are
noncuspidal;
and
that,
in
the
terminology
of
Example
2.5,
these
actions
are
l-logarithmically
full,
and,
moreover,
ι
maps
the
l-inertia
subgroup
of
JG
isomorphically
onto
that
of
JH
.
Then
α
is
graphic.
(iv)
Outgrph
(ΠG
)
is
commensurably
terminal
in
Out(ΠG
).
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
By
Theorem
1.6,
(i),
it
suﬃces
to
prove
that
α
is
numerically
cuspidal,
under
the
further
assumption
that
G,
H
have
cusps
[i.e.,
that
ΠG
,
ΠH
are
free
—
cf.
Remark
1.1.3].
By
passing
to
sturdy
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
G,
H
that
correspond
via
α
[cf.
Remark
1.1.5],
it
follows
from
Proposition
2.4,
(iv),
that
ι
preserves
positive
and
null
Q-cyclotomic
characters
to
Z×
l
.
Thus,
by
Proposition
2.4,
(vii),
it
follows
that
ι
preserves
the
Q-cyclotomic
characters
to
Z×
l
of
weight
2.
Now,
by
applying
Proposition
1.3
to
the
compactiﬁcations
[cf.
Remark
1.1.6]
of
sturdy
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
G

→
G,
H
→
H
that
correspond
via
α
[cf.
cusp
(respectively,
MH
)
may
be
Remark
1.1.5],
we
conclude
that
the
rank
of
MGcusp


computed
as
the
diﬀerence
between
the
l-weight
2
and
l-weight
0
ranks
of
MG

(respectively,
MH
)
[cf.
Proposition
2.4,
(ii);
Remark
1.3.1];
moreover,
[cf.
Remark
1.3.1]
this
data
allows
one
to
compute
r(G

)
(respectively,
r(H
)).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
By
assertion
(i),
it
follows
that
α
is
grouptheoretically
cuspidal.
Thus,
by
replacing
G,
H
by
the
compactiﬁcations
[cf.
Remark
1.1.6]
of
sturdy
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
G,
H
that
correspond
via
α
[cf.
Remark
1.1.5],
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
G,
H
are
noncuspidal.
Thus,
by
Theorem
1.6,
(ii);
Remark
1.4.1,
it
suﬃces
to
prove
that
α
is
verticially
ﬁltrationpreserving.
But
this
follows
from
Proposition
2.4,
(ix).
This
completes
the
proof
of
def
assertion
(ii).
Assertion
(iv)
follows
formally
from
assertion
(ii)
[by
taking
H
=
G;
JG
,
JH
to
be
open
subgroups
of
Outgrph
(ΠG
)
—
cf.
Proposition
2.4,
(v)].
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
By
Theorem
1.6,
(ii);
Remark
1.4.1,
it
suﬃces
to
prove
that
α
is
verticially
ﬁltration-preserving.
But
this
follows
from
Proposition
2.6
and
the
assumptions
concerning
the
l-inertia
subgroups.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii).

Remark
2.7.1.
Corollary
2.7,
(iv),
may
be
regarded
as
a
sort
of
anabelian
analogue
of
the
well-known
linear
algebra
fact
that,
if
k
is
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld,
then
parabolic
subgroups
of
the
general
linear
group
GLn
(k),
where
n
≥
2
—
e.g.,
the
subgroups
that
preserve
some
ﬁltration
of
a
k-vector
space
of
dimension
n
—
are
normally
terminal
in
GLn
(k)
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Hum],
p.
179].
Remark
2.7.2.
Note
that
the
group-theoretic
cuspidality
of
[Mzk4],
Lemma
1.3.9
(respectively,
the
graphicity
of
[Mzk4],
Lemma
2.3)
may
be
regarded
as
a
[rather
weak]
special
case
of
Corollary
2.7,
(i)
(respectively,
Corollary
2.7,
(ii))
—
cf.
the
proof
of
Proposition
2.4,

above.
Corollary
2.8.
(Graphicity
over
an
Arithmetic
Logarithmic
Point)
Let
G,
H
be
semi-graphs
of
anabelioids
of
pro-Σ
PSC-type;
JG
→
Aut(G),
JH
→
24
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
Aut(H)
continuous
homomorphisms
that
arise
from
data
as
in
Example
2.5
such
that
[in
the
terminology
of
Example
2.5]
the
resulting
actions
are
l-logarithmically
full,
for
some
l
∈
Σ,
and
arithmetically
full,
with
base
ﬁeld
isomorphic
to
a
subﬁeld
of
a
ﬁnitely
generated
extension
of
Fp
or
Qp
,
for
some
prime
p
∈
Σ
[where
we
allow
p
to
diﬀer
for
G,
H].
Suppose,
moreover,
that
we
have
been
given
isomorphisms
of
proﬁnite
groups
∼
α
:
ΠG
→
ΠH
;
∼
ι
:
JG
→
JH
which
are
compatible,
with
respect
to
the
respective
outer
actions
of
JG
,
JH
on
ΠG
,
ΠH
,
and
satisfy
the
property
that
ι
maps
the
l-inertia
subgroup
of
JG
isomorphically
onto
that
of
JH
.
Then
the
respective
actions
of
JG
,
JH
on
G,
H
are
weakly
l-graphically
full,
and
α
is
graphic.
Proof.
Indeed,
by
using
the
Frobenius
elements
of
the
Galois
group
of
a
ﬁnitely
generated
extension
of
Fp
or
Qp
containing
the
base
ﬁeld
in
question
[cf.
the
proof
of
Proposition
2.4,
(v)],
one
obtains
that
JG
,
JH
are
weakly
l-graphically
full.
[Note
that,
unlike
the
situation
in
the
proof
of
Proposition
2.4,
(v),
the
pointed
stable
curve
over
a
ﬁnite
ﬁeld
that
one
uses
here
to
conclude
weak
l-graphic
fullness
will,
in
general,
be
a
degeneration
of
the
original
pointed
stable
curve
over
the
base
ﬁeld
appearing
in
Example
2.5.
This
is
the
reason
why
[unlike
the
situation
in
the
proof
of
Proposition
2.4,
(v)]
in
the
present
context,
one
may
only
conclude
weak
l-graphic
fullness.]
By
Corollary
2.7,
(i),
we
thus
conclude
that
α
is
grouptheoretically
cuspidal.
Moreover,
this
allows
us
[by
passing
to
compactiﬁcations
of
sturdy
ﬁnite
étale
coverings]
to
reduce
to
the
noncuspidal
case,
hence
to
conclude
that
α
is
graphic
by

Remark
2.8.1.
In
the
situation
of
Corollary
2.8,
suppose
further
that
the
base
ﬁeld
in
question
is
sub-p-adic
[i.e.,
isomorphic
to
a
subﬁeld
of
a
ﬁnitely
generated
extension
of
Qp
],
and
that
ι
lies
over
an
isomorphism
between
the
absolute
Galois
groups
of
the
respective
base
ﬁelds
that
arises
from
an
isomorphism
between
the
respective
base
ﬁelds.
Then
one
may
apply
the
main
result
of
[Mzk3]
—
just
as
the
main
result
of
[Tama1]
was
applied
in
[Mzk2],
§7
—
to
the
various
verticial
subgroups
to
obtain
a
version
of
the
Grothendieck
conjecture
for
pointed
stable
curves
over
a
sub-p-adic
ﬁeld.
Note
that
in
this
situation,
when
Σ
is
the
set
of
all
primes,
one
may
also
reconstruct
the
log
structures
at
the
nodes
by
considering
the
decomposition
groups
at
the
nodes
[cf.
the
theory
of
[Mzk2],
§6].
We
leave
the
routine
details
to

reader.
Remark
2.8.2.
In
the
situation
of
Corollary
2.8,
suppose
further
that
the
base
ﬁeld
in
question
is
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
[which
may
diﬀer
for
G,
H],
and
that
Σ
is
the
set
of
all
primes.
Then
observe
that
it
follows
from
[Mzk4],
Lemma
1.1.4,
(ii),
that
ι
lies
over
an
isomorphism
between
the
absolute
Galois
groups
of
the
respective
base
ﬁelds
[that
does
not
necessarily
arise
from
an
isomorphism
between
the
respective
base
ﬁelds!].
Now
suppose
further
that
the
hyperbolic
curve
constituted
by
[the
complement
of
the
nodes
and
cusps
in]
each
irreducible
component

of
the

the

that
give
rise
to
the
data
in
question
is
isogenous
[cf.
§0]
to
a
hyperbolic
curve
of
genus
zero.
Then
it
follows
from
the
theory
of
[Mzk6],
§4
—
more
precisely,
the
“rigidity”
of
the
cuspidal
edge-like
subgroups
implied
by
[Mzk6],
Theorem
4.3,
together
with
the
integral
absoluteness
of
[Mzk6],
Corollary
4.11
—
that
one
may
reconstruct
the
log
structures
at
the
nodes
by
considering
the
decomposition

at
the

[cf.
the

Let

By

1.6,

it

But
this

from

Remark
2.9.1.
Note
that
the

as
a
[rather
weak]
special
case
of

cf.
the

Finally,

Then
the

hold.

We

Suppose

Then

≥

Write

)
for
the

of
[André],
§4
[cf.

def

N
for

i.e.,
the

((Xi

such
that
the

is
an
extension
of
a
ﬁnite
group
whose
order
is
a
product
of
primes
∈
Σ
by
a
discrete
free
group.
[Here,
we
recall
that
such
a
discrete
free
group
corresponds
to
a
“combinatorial
covering”
determined
by
the
graph
of
the
special
ﬁber
of
some

of
a
covering
of
Xi
—
cf.
[André],
Proposition
4.3.1;
[André],
the
proof
of
Lemma
6.1.1.]
Thus,
we
have
a
natural
continuous
outer
action
of
Gi
on
Δtemp
;
Δi
is
the
pro-Σ
completion
of
Δtemp
.
Then
the
operation
i

of

completion
determines
a
surjection
from
the
set
of

of

considered

of
the

to
the
set
of

of

of
topological
groups
∼
γG
:
G1
→
G2
;
∼
γΔ
:
Δ1
→
Δ2
considered
up
to
inner
automorphisms
of
the
Δi
.
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
Since
[as
is
well-known]
Gi
is
an
extension
of
an
abelian
proﬁnite
group
by
a
nonabelian
pro-pi
group,
it
follows
that
pi
may
be
characterized
as
the
unique
prime
number
p
such
that
Gi
contains
a
nonabelian
pro-p
closed
subgroup.
Thus,
the
existence
of
αG
implies
that
p1
=
p2
;
write
def
p
=
p1
=
p2
.
Now
since
the
tensor
product
with
Qp
of
the
abelianization
of
any
open
subgroup
of
Δi
admits
a
ﬁltration
[cf.,
e.g.,
[FC],
Chapter
III,
Corollary
7.3]
each
of
whose
subquotients
is
Hodge-Tate
[relative
to
the
action
of
some
open
A
COMBINATORIAL

27
subgroup
of
Gi
],
with
Hodge-Tate
decomposition
only
involving
“Tate
twists”
by
the
zero-th
or
ﬁrst
power
of
the
cyclotomic
character
[cf.
[Tate],
§4,
Corollary
2],
it
follows
that
Gi
is
[relative
to
its
outer
action
on
Δi
]
weakly
p-graphically
full.
Thus,
the
remainder
of
assertion
(i)
follows
from
Corollary
2.7,
(i).
def
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
Let
l
∈
Σ
be
distinct
from
p
=
p1
=
p2
.
Write
(l)
(l)
Δi

Δi
for
the
maximal
pro-l
quotient
of
Δi
.
Since
the
subgroup
of
Out(Δi
)
(l)
that
induces
the
identity
on
the
tensor
product
with
Fl
of
the
abelianization
of
Δi
is
[easily
seen
to
be]
a
pro-l
group,
it
follows
that
by
replacing
Gi
by
an
open
sub(l)
group
of
Gi
,
we
may
assume
that
the
natural
map
Gi
→
Out(Δi
)
factors
through
(l)
the
maximal
pro-l
quotient
Gi

Gi
of
Gi
.
Thus,
the
data
given
by
the
outer
(l)
(l)
action
of
Gi
on
Δi
is
l-logarithmically
full
data
of
the
type
considered
in
Example
2.5.
In
particular,
in
the
noncuspidal
case,
assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
Corollary
2.7,
(iii).
On
the
other
hand,
even
if
we
are
not
in
the
noncuspidal
case,
by
passing
to
compactiﬁcations
of
sturdy
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
the
Xi
and
applying
the
fact
that
a
cuspidal
edge-like
subgroup
belongs
to
a
unique
verticial
subgroup
[cf.
Proposition
1.5,
(i)],
we
reduce
immediately
[via
assertion
(i)]
to
the
noncuspidal
case.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Finally,
we
observe
that
assertion
(iii)
follows
formally
from
assertion
(ii)
via
the
same
argument
applied
[in
the
case
where
Σ
is
the
set
of
all
primes,
and
the
base
ﬁelds
are
ﬁnite
extensions
of
Qp
]
in
the
proof
of
[Mzk7],
Theorem
6.6,
to
derive
the
“surjectivity
portion”
of
[Mzk7],
Theorem
6.6,
from
[Mzk4],
Lemma
2.3.

Remark
2.10.1.
Since
free
discrete
groups
inject
into
their
pro-Σ
completions
[cf.
[RZ],
Proposition
3.3.15],
the
natural
map
Δtemp
→
Δi
is
injective
[cf.
the
i
proof
of
[Mzk7],
Corollary
3.11].
On
the
other
hand,
unlike
the
situation
of
[Mzk7],
Theorem
6.6,
we
are
unable
to
conclude
that
the
surjection
of
Corollary
2.10,
(iii),
is
a
bijection
since
[unlike
the
proﬁnite
case
—
cf.
[André],
Corollary
6.2.2]
it
is
not
is
equal
to
its
own
normalizer
