Abstract.
In
the
present
paper,
we
study
category-theoretic
properties
of
monomorphisms
in
categories
of
log
schemes.
This
study
allows
one
to
give
a
purely
categorytheoretic
reconstruction
of
the
log
scheme
that
gave
rise
to
the
category
under
consideration.
We
also
obtain
analogous
results
for
categories
of
schemes
of
locally
ﬁnite
type
over
the
ring
of
rational
integers
that
are
equipped
with
“archimedean
structures”.
Such
reconstructions
were
discussed
in
two
previous
papers
by
the
author,
but
these
reconstructions
contained
some
errors,
which
were
pointed
out
to
the
author
by
C.
Nakayama
and
Y.
Hoshi.
These
errors
revolve
around
certain
elementary
combinatorial
aspects
of
fan
decompositions
of
two-dimensional
rational
polyhedral
cones
—
i.e.,
of
the
sort
that
occur
in
the
classical
theory
of
toric
varieties
—
and
may
be
repaired
by
applying
the
theory
developed
in
the
present
paper.

The
purpose
of
the
present
paper
is
to
study,
in
some
detail,
various
aspects
of
the
structure
of
categories
of
log
schemes
that
revolve
around
the
behavior
of
monomorphisms
in
such
categories.
This
study
leads
naturally
to
a
purely
category-theoretic
reconstruction
of
the
log
scheme
that
gave
rise
to
the
category
under
consideration.
Our
main
result
is
the
following
[cf.
Theorem
3.8,
(iii)].

For

over

and

of

[cf.
the

at

of

for

Let
∼
Φ
:

be
an
[arbitrary!]

of

Then
there

such
that

is

to
the

of

induced
by

of

We
also
obtain
analogous
results
for

of

“SCHlog

[cf.

as
well
as

with

[cf.

The
theory
exposed
in
the
present
paper
arose
as
an
attempt
to
correct
errors,
pointed
out
to
the
author
by
Chikara
Nakayama
and
Yuichiro
Hoshi
in
June
2013,
in
the
theory
of
[LgSch],
§2.
These
errors
concern
the
category-theoretic
properties
of
monomorphisms
in
categories
of
log
schemes
and
are
discussed
in
more
detail
in
Example
0.3
and
Remark
1.4.1
of
the
present
paper.
At
the
level
of
main
results
of
the
paper
[LgSch],
these
errors
in
the
theory
of
[LgSch],
§2,
do
not
aﬀect
the
proof
of
[LgSch],
Theorem
A,
given
in
[LgSch],
§1,
but
they
do
aﬀect
the
proof
—
although
not
the
validity!
—
of
[LgSch],
Theorem
B.
This
result
[LgSch],
Theorem
B,
is
given
a
correct
proof
in
§3
of
the
present
paper
and
corresponds
precisely
to
Theorem
A
[stated
above].
At
the
level
of
main
results
of
papers
of
the
author
subsequent
to
[LgSch],
the
only
place
where
the
errors
in
the
theory
of
[LgSch],
§2,
have
an
eﬀect
is
in
the
portion
of
the
proof
of
the
main
result
of
[ArLgSch]
[i.e.,
[ArLgSch],
Theorem
5.1]
that
involves
the
theory
of
[ArLgSch],
§4.
The
aﬀected
portions
of
[ArLgSch],
§4,
are
discussed
in
more
detail
in
the
introduction
to
§4
of
the

The
main

[ArLgSch],
Theorem
5.1,
of
[ArLgSch]
is
given
a
correct
proof
in
§4
of
the
present
paper
and
corresponds
precisely
to
Theorem
4.8,
(iv)
[quoted
above].
At
the
level
of
individual
propositions,
lemmas,
corollaries,
theorems,
and
examples
[i.e.,
which
do
not
necessarily
qualify
as
“main
results”
of
the
paper
under
consideration],
a
detailed
discussion
of
the
aﬀected
portions
of
[LgSch]
and
[ArLgSch]
may
be
found
in
the
Appendix
to
the
present
paper.
One
important
invariant
of
the
structure
of
an
fs
log
scheme
is
the
rank
of
the
groupiﬁcation
of
the
ﬁber
of
the
characteristic
sheaf
associated
to
the
log
structure
at
a
geometric
point
of
the
underlying
scheme
of
the
log
scheme
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.2,
(i)].
For
instance,
when
this
rank
is
equal
to
0
at
all
geometric
points,
the
log
MONOMORPHISMS
IN
CATEGORIES
OF

3
structure
of
the
fs
log
scheme
under
consideration
is
trivial.
One
central
theme
of
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
consists
of
the
phenomenon
that
the
theory
of
category-theoretic
properties
of
monomorphisms
exhibits
quite
substantive
qualitative
diﬀerences,
depending
upon
whether
or
not
it
holds
that
the
ranks
just
referred
to
are
≤
1.
When
it
holds
that
these
rank
are
≤
1,
the
fs
log
scheme
under
consideration
will
be
referred
to
in
the
present
paper
as
submonic
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.2,
(i)].
Thus,
in
some
sense,
the
simplest
“borderline
case”
between
submonic
and
non-submonic
fs
log
schemes
is
the
case
of
a
log
scheme
whose
underlying
scheme
is
the
spectrum
of
a
ﬁeld
whose
absolute
Galois
group
acts
trivially
on
geometric
ﬁbers
of
the
characteristic
sheaf
associated
to
the
log
structure,
and
for
which
the
rank
of
the
groupiﬁcation
of
each
such
geometric
ﬁber
of
the
characteristic
sheaf
is
equal
to
2.
In
this
case,
the
log
scheme
under
consideration
will
be
referred
to
as
log-nodal
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.2,
(i)].
One
important
feature
of
the
category-theoretic
properties
of
monomorphisms
in
categories
of
log
schemes
lies
in
the
observation
that
these
category-theoretic
properties
of
monomorphisms
take
on
a
particularly
straightforward
and
intuitive
form
whenever
it
holds
that
the
various
fs
log
schemes
under
consideration
are
all
submonic.
This
observation
is
one
of
the
main
themes
of
the
theory
discussed
in
§1
of
the
present
paper.
Roughly
speaking,
the
errors
pointed
out
by
Nakayama
and
Hoshi
in
the
theory
of
[LgSch],
§2,
may
be
summarized
as
follows:
the
author
wrote
[LgSch],
§2,
under
the
misunderstanding
that
this
“straightforward”
and
“intuitive”
approach
to
category-theoretic
properties
of
monomorphisms
holds
even
if
the
various
fs
log
schemes
under
consideration
are
not
necessarily
submonic.
On
the
other
hand,
it
turns
out
[cf.
the
theory
of
§2
of
the
present
paper]
that
the
various
complications
that
occur
in
the
study
of
the
category-theoretic
properties
of
monomorphisms
of
arbitrary
non-submonic
fs
log
schemes
already
appear
in
the
case
of
log-nodal
fs
log
schemes.
Moreover,
it
turns
out
that
these
complications
essentially
revolve
around
various
combinatorial
aspects
of
fan
decompositions
of
two-dimensional
rational
polyhedral
cones,
i.e.,
of
the
sort
that
occur
in
the
classical
theory
of
toric
varieties.
These
elementary
combinatorial
aspects
are
reviewed
in
§0
of
the
present
paper.
The
theory
developed
in
the
present
paper
may
be
summarized
as
follows.
In
§1,
we
introduce
basic
terminology
and
discuss
various
generalities
concerning
monomorphisms
in
categories
of
log
schemes.
In
particular,
we
discuss
[cf.,
especially,
Lemma
1.5]
how
the
elementary
combinatorics
of
two-dimensional
fan
decompositions
reviewed
in
§0
may
be
interpreted
in
the
context
of
categories
of
log
schemes.
In
§2,
we
apply
these
elementary
combinatorics
of
two-dimensional
fan
decompositions
[cf.
Proposition
2.3]
to
show,
in
eﬀect,
that
certain
connectedness
properties
of
such
fan
decompositions
allow
one
to
give
a
category-theoretic
characterization
of
submonic
fs
log
schemes.
We
then
proceed
to
give,
in
Theorem
4
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
2.6,
a
category-theoretic
reconstruction
of
the
scheme
structure
of
a
submonic
fs
log
scheme.
This
reconstruction
is
quite
“straightforward”
and
“intuitive”
and
amounts,
in
essence,
to
an
application
of
the
techniques
of
[LgSch],
§2.
In
the
remainder
of
§2,
we
show
[cf.
Corollary
2.12]
that
the
various
complications
that
arise
in
the
case
of
arbitrary
non-submonic
fs
log
schemes
amount,
in
essence,
to
the
issue
of
giving
a
category-theoretic
algorithm
that
allows
one
to
distinguish
a
log-nodal
fs
log
scheme
from
a
nontrivial
log
étale
localization
of
such
a
log-nodal
fs
log
scheme
[i.e.,
of
the
sort
that
arises
from
a
nontrivial
two-dimensional
fan
decomposition].
Such
a
category-theoretic
algorithm
is
furnished,
in
eﬀect,
by
the
theory
of
seamless
partitions
of
orientable
log
schemes
developed
in
§3
[cf.
Theorem
3.6].
This
theory
may
be
regarded
as
a
translation
into
category
theory
of
the
elementary
observation
that
a
nontrivial
two-dimensional
fan
decomposition
may
be
distinguished
from
a
trivial
two-dimensional
fan
decomposition
by
considering
the
“seamless
partition”
constituted
by
the
various
constituent
cones
of
the
fan
decomposition.
Finally,
in
§4,
we
observe
that
the
theory
developed
in
§1,
§2,
§3
may
be
generalized,
without
any
essential
complications,
to
the
case
of
fs
log
schemes
of
locally
ﬁnite
type
over
Z
that
are
equipped
with
archimedean
structures
[cf.
Theorems
4.3,
4.8].
Such
generalizations
allow
one
to
avoid
the
diﬃculties
that
arise
from
applying
the
erroneous
portions
of
[LgSch],
§2,
in
the
theory
of
[ArLgSch],
§4,
i.e.,
by,
in
essence,
isolating
the
[easily
resolved]
submonic
aspects
of
these
diﬃculties
from
the
[more
subtle!]
non-submonic
aspects
of
these
diﬃculties.

by
which

the

of

n
≥

and
by

the

By

we

the

We

the

refer

a
ﬁnitely
generated,
saturated
[cf.
[Kato2],
§1.1]
monoid
that
has
no
nonzero
invertible
elements
as
an
fs
monoid.
Thus,
if
P
is
an
fs
monoid,
MONOMORPHISMS

then
the
natural
homomorphism
of
monoids
P
→
P
gp
from
P
to
its
groupiﬁcation
P
gp
is
injective,
and
P
gp
is
a
ﬁnitely
generated
free
abelian
group.
We
shall
refer
to
the
rank
of
P
gp
as
the
rank
rk(P
)
of
the
fs
monoid
P
.
A
homomorphism
of
monoids
φ
:
P
→
Q
between
monoids
P
,
Q
will
be
called
positive
if
φ
maps
every
nonzero
element
of
P
to
a
nonzero
element
of
Q.
A
nonzero
element
a
∈
P
of
a
monoid
P
will
be
called
a
sum-dominator
if
there
exists
a
positive
integer
n
such
that
n
·
a
may
be
written
as
the
sum
of
a
ﬁnite
collection
of
generators
of
P
.
Thus,
if
φ
:
P
→
Q
is
a
nonzero
homomorphism
[i.e.,
a
homomorphism
that
maps
any
collection
of
generators
of
P
to
a
subset
of
Q
that
contains
at
least
one
nonzero
element!]
from
an
arbitrary
monoid
P
to
an
fs
monoid
Q,
and
a
∈
P
is
a
sum-dominator,
then
φ(a)
=
0.
We
shall
say
that
a
homomorphism
of
monoids
φ
:
P
→
Q
is
sum-dominating
if
it
maps
every
nonzero
element
of
P
to
a
sum-dominator
of
Q.
Thus,
a
sum-dominating
homomorphism
is
necessarily
positive.
Let
P
be
an
fs
monoid.
Thus,
in
the
terminology
of
the
discussion
entitled
“Monoids”
of
[FrdI],
§0,
P
is
sharp,
integral,
and
saturated.
In
particular,
it
makes
sense
to
speak
of
the
perfection
P
pf
of
P
,
as
well
as
of
the
set
of
primes
Prime(P
)
of
P
—
cf.
the
discussion
entitled
“Monoids”
of
[FrdI],
§0,
for
more
details.
Rank
two
fs
monoids:
Now
let
us
suppose
that
P
is
an
fs
monoid
of
rank
two.
Then
we
recall
that
there
exists
an
isomorphism
of
monoids
∼
P
pf
→
Q≥0
⊕
Q≥0
[cf.
[ExtFam],
Proposition
1.7].
In
particular,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
the
set
of
primes
Prime(P
)
=
Prime(P
pf
)
is
of
cardinality
two.
Write
Prime(P
)
=
Prime(P
pf
)
=
{p1
,
p2
}.
Thus,
for
each
i
=
1,
2,
pi
may
be
regarded
as
a
collection
of
elements
of
P
pf
,
which
generates
a
submonoid
Pppfi
⊆
P
pf
.
For
simplicity,
let
us
def
write
Pi
=
Pppfi
.
Then
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
the
two
direct
summands
of
the
codomain
of
the
isomorphism
of
the
above
display
correspond
precisely
to
P1
,
P2
,
i.e.,
we
have
a
natural
isomorphism
∼
P1
⊕
P2
→
P
pf
and
noncanonical
isomorphisms
of
abstract
monoids
P1
∼
=
P2
∼
=
Q≥0
.
In
particular,
these
two
direct
summands
are
preserved,
up
to
possible
permutation,
by
any
automorphism
of
the
monoid
P
pf
.
Note
that
[since
the
monoid
Q≥0
has
no
nontrivial
automorphisms
of
ﬁnite
order]
these
observations
imply
that
any
ﬁnite
subgroup
of
Aut(P
pf
)
—
or,
indeed,
of
Aut(P
)
(→
Aut(P
pf
))
—
is
of
order
≤
2.
Next,
let
def
φ0
:
P
→
J
0
=
N
6
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
be
a
positive
homomorphism
that
induces
a
surjection
on
groupiﬁcations
φgp
0
:
gp
gp
∼
gp
gp
P

J0
=
Z.
Thus,
Ker(φ0
)
=
Z.
Fix
a
nonzero
element
a
∈
Ker(φ0
)
⊆
P
gp
.
For
i
=
1,
2,
write
(P
⊆)
Ji
⊆
P
gp
for
the
saturation
[cf.
[LgSch],
Lemma
2.5,
(ii)]
of
the
submonoid
of
P
gp
generated
by
P
and
a
if
i
=
1
(respectively,
−a
if
i
=
2)
and
φi
:
P
→
Ji
for
the
natural
inclusion.
Thus,
P
gp
=
Jigp
for
i
=
1,
2.
One
veriﬁes
immediately
that,
up
to
a
possible
permutation
of
the
indices
“1”
and
“2”,
the
submonoids
J1
and
J2
of
P
gp
are
independent
of
the
choice
of
a.
Moreover,
we
observe
that
it
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
J1
and
J2
that
if
i
=
0
(respectively,
i
=
1,
i
=
2),
then
a
positive
homomorphism
φ
:
P
→

factors,

through
a
positive
homomorphism
Ji
→
N
if
and
only
if
the
homomorphism
induced
on
groupiﬁcations
φgp
:
P
gp
→
Z
satisﬁes
the
condition
φgp
(a)
=
0
(respectively,
φgp
(a)
>
0;
φgp
(a)
<
0).
In
this
situation,
we
shall
refer
to
J1
and
J2
as
bisecting
monoids
of
P
at
φ0
.
Before
proceeding,
we
observe
the
following
“continuity
property”
of
bisecting
monoids:
Suppose
that
P
∗
⊆
P
gp
is
a
rank
two
fs
monoid
that
arises
as
a
submonoid
of
P
gp
that
contains
P
.
For
i
=
1,
2,
suppose
that
there
exists
a
homomorphism
ψi
:
P
∗
→
N
whose
restriction
to
P
factors,
via
φi
:
P
→
Ji
,
through
a
positive
homomorphism
Ji
→
N.
Then
φ0
:
P
→
N
extends
to
a
positive
homomorphism
ψ0
:
P
∗
→
N.
Indeed,
if
φ0
does
not
admit
such
an
extension
ψ0
,
then
it
follows
that
there
exist
nonzero
elements
b
∈
P
,
c
∈
P
∗
such
that
a
+
b
+
c
=
0
for
some
element
a
∈
gp
Ker(φgp
0
)
⊆
P
.
Then
it
follows
from
the
above
discussion
of
bisecting
monoids
that,
for
some
i
∈
{1,
2},
ψigp
(a)
≥
0.
Since
the
restriction
of
ψi
to
P
is
a
positive
homomorphism,
we
thus
conclude
that
0
=
ψigp
(a)
+
ψigp
(b)
+
ψigp
(c)
>
0
∈
N,
a
contradiction.
This
completes
the
proof
of
this
“continuity
property”.
Bisecting
monoids
may
be
understood
more
explicitly
if
one
passes
to
perfections.
Indeed,
by
restricting
our
attention
to
perfections,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
P
pf
=
Q≥0
⊕
Q≥0
,
P1
=
Q≥0
⊕
0,
P2
=
0
⊕
Q≥0
,
pf
and
that
φpf
→
Q≥0
is
the
homomorphism
determined
by
sending
(1,
0)
and
0
:
P
def
(0,
1)
to
1.
Then
one
computes
easily
that,
if
one
takes
a
=
(1,
−1),
then
J1pf
is
equal
to
the
perfection
of
the
submonoid
of
(P
pf
)gp
=
Q⊕Q
generated
by
(0,
1)
and
(1,
−1),
while
J2pf
is
equal
to
the
perfection
of
the
submonoid
of
(P
pf
)gp
=
Q
⊕
Q
generated
by
(1,
0)
and
(−1,
1).
Thus,
if
φpf
maps
(1,
0)
→
α;
(0,
1)
→
β

for
α,
β
∈
Q≥0
,
then
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
φpf
:
P
pf
→
Q≥0
factors,
via
pf
φpf
→
Jipf
,
through
a
positive
homomorphism

(respectively,

⇐⇒

(respectively,

α
<

In
the
present
paper,
we
shall
often
consider
certain
sequences
of
submonoids
satisfying
certain
special
properties,
as
in
the
following
examples.

such
that
every

φ

factors
through
a
positive
homomorphism
n
P

for
some
n
[which
may
depend
on

and,
moreover,
for
each
m

N,
m
P
is
a
bisecting
monoid
of
P
[hence,
in

an

∞
φgp
(m

via
∞

φ

both

Indeed,
by

one

immediately
to
the

is
a
bisecting
monoid

Such

Log
schemes:
If
X
is
a
scheme,
then
we
shall
write
Xred
⊆
X
for
the
closed
subscheme
determined
by
equipping
the
underlying
topological
space
of
the
scheme
X
with
the
reduced
induced
scheme
structure.
If
X
is
the
underlying
log
for
the
log
scheme
of
a
log
scheme
X
log
[cf.
[Kato1],
§1.2],
then
we
shall
write
Xred
log
scheme
determined
by
restricting
the
log
structure
of
X
to
Xred
⊆
X.
We
shall
use
the
terms
log
étale
(respectively,
log
smooth)
to
refer
to
morphisms
between
log
schemes
which
are
“étale”
(respectively,
“smooth”)
in
the
sense
of
[Kato1],
§3.3
(respectively,
[Kato1],
§3.3;
[Kato2],
§8.1).
We
use
the
term
“fs
log
scheme”
to
refer
to
a
log
scheme
which
is
ﬁne
[cf.
[Kato1],
§2.3]
and
saturated
[cf.
[the
evident
étale
generalization
of]
[Kato2],
§1.5].
We
shall
refer
to
a
log
scheme
as
noetherian
(respectively,
locally
noetherian)
if
its
underlying
scheme
is
noetherian
(respectively,
locally
noetherian).
We
shall
say
that
a
morphism
of
log
schemes
is
of
ﬁnite
type
if
its
underlying
morphism
of
schemes
is
of
ﬁnite
type.
We
shall
say
that
a
morphism
of
log
schemes
is
an
open
immersion
if
its
underlying
morphism
of
schemes
is
an
open
immersion,
and,
moreover,
the
log
structure
on
its
domain
is
obtained
as
the
pull-back
of
the
log
structure
on
its
codomain.
We
shall
say
that
a
morphism
of
log
schemes
is
dominant
if
its
underlying
morphism
of
schemes
is
dominant.
We
recall
from
[LgSch],
Lemma
2.6,
(i),
(ii),
(iii),
that
the
natural
morphism
from
the
underlying
scheme
of
any
ﬁber
product
in
the
category
of
locally
noetherian
fs
log
schemes
to
the
corresponding
ﬁber
product
of
underlying
schemes
is
ﬁnite.
On
the
other
hand,
this
natural
morphism
is
not
necessarily
surjective!
That
is
to
say,
the
isomorphism
asserted
[unfortunately,
without
an
explicit
proof!]
in
[LgSch],
Lemma
2.6,
(ii),
is
false.
Indeed,
the
following
example
constitutes
a
counterexample
to
this
isomorphism.

Section
1:
Generalities
on
Monomorphisms
and
Minimal
Points
In
the
present
§1,
we
discuss
various
deﬁnitions
and
generalities
related
to
monomorphisms
and
“minimal
points”
in
categories
of
log
schemes.
We
suppose
that
we
are
in
the
situation
of
[LgSch],
§2.
That
is
to
say,
let
X
log
be
a
locally
noetherian
fs
log
scheme
[cf.
the
discussion
entitled
“Log
schemes”
in
§0].
Then
we
denote
by
Schlog
(X
log
)
the
category
whose
objects
are
morphisms
of
log
schemes
of
ﬁnite
type
Y
log
→
X
log
,
where
Y
log
is
a
noetherian
fs
log
scheme,
and
whose
morphisms
[from
an
object
Y1log
→
X
log
to
an
object
Y2log
→
X
log
]
are
morphisms
of
ﬁnite
type
Y1log
→
Y2log
lying
over
X
log
.
To
simplify
the
exposition,
we
shall
often
refer
to
the
domain
Y
log
of
an
arrow
Y
log
→
X
log
which
is
an
object
of
Schlog
(X
log
)
as
an
“object
of
Schlog
(X
log
)”.
Recall
the
category
Sch(X)
of
[LgSch],
§1,
i.e.,
the
category
whose
objects
are
morphisms
of
ﬁnite
type
Y
→
X,
where
Y
is
a
noetherian
scheme,
and
whose
morphisms
[from
an
object
Y1
→
X
to
an
object
Y2
→
X]
are
morphisms
of
ﬁnite
type
Y1
→
Y2
lying
over
X.
Note
that
by
associating
to
an
object
Y
→
X
of
Sch(X)
the
object
Y
log
→
X
log
of
Schlog
(X
log
)
obtained
by
equipping
Y
with
the
log
structure
obtained
by
pulling
back
the
log
structure
on
X
log
via
Y
→
X,
we
obtain
a
natural
embedding
Sch(X)
→
Schlog
(X
log
)
—
which
thus
allows
us
to
regard
Sch(X)
as
a
full
subcategory
of
Schlog
(X
log
).
Let
Y
log
be
an
fs
log
scheme.
Then
we
shall
denote
its
underlying
scheme
(respectively,
the
morphism
of
monoids
that
constitutes
its
log
structure)
by
Y
(respectively,
expY
:
MY
→
OY
).
Thus,
we
have
an
exact
sequence
of
étale
sheaves
of
monoids
on
Y
0
→
OY×
→
MY
→
PY
→
0
10
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
—
where
the
“characteristic
sheaf
”
PY
is
deﬁned
so
as
to
make
the
sequence
exact.
It
follows
immediately
from
the
fact
that
Y
log
is
an
fs
log
scheme
that
the
ﬁbers
of
PY
(respectively,
the
groupiﬁcation
PYgp
of
PY
)
at
geometric
points
of
Y
are
fs
monoids
[cf.
the
discussion
entitled
“Generalities
on
monoids”
in
§0]
(respectively,
are
ﬁnitely
generated
free
abelian
groups).
In
particular,
we
have
natural
injections
PY
→
PYgp
;
MY
→
MYgp
—
where
the
superscript
“gp”
denotes
the
groupiﬁcation
associated
to
a
sheaf
of
monoids.
In
the
following,
we
shall
use
similar
notation
for
objects
associated
to
arbitrary
fs
log
schemes
“(−)log
”.
In
this
situation,
we
shall
apply
the
terminology
introduced
in
[LgSch],
§2:
Deﬁnition
1.1.
In
the
notation
of
the
above
discussion:
(i)
If
Y
is
reduced
(respectively,
one-pointed
—
cf.
[LgSch],
Proposition
1.1),
then
we
shall
say
that
Y
log
is
reduced
(respectively,
one-pointed).
If
Y
log
is
reduced
and
one-pointed,
i.e.,
Y
is
equal
to
the
spectrum
of
a
ﬁeld
k,
then
one
may
think
of
PY
as
consisting
of
a
[discrete]
monoid
equipped
with
a
continuous
action
of
the
absolute
Galois
group
Gk
of
k;
when
this
action
is
trivial,
we
shall
say
that
Y
log
is
split
and,
by
a
slight
abuse
of
notation,
denote
Γ(Y,
PY
)
by
PY
.
(ii)
An
object
Y
log
→
X
log
of
Schlog
(X
log
)
will
be
called
minimal
if
it
is
non-initial
and
satisﬁes
the
property
that
any
monomorphism
Z
log

Y
log
in
Schlog
(X
log
),
where
Z
log
is
non-initial,
is
necessarily
an
isomorphism
[cf.
[LgSch],
Proposition
2.4].
(iii)
Suppose
that
Y
log
is
a
one-pointed
object
of
the
category
Schlog
(X
log
).
Then
a
monomorphism
H
log

Y
log
in
Schlog
(X
log
)
will
be
called
a
hull
for
Y
log
if
every
morphism
S
log
→
Y
log
in
Schlog
(X
log
)
from
a
minimal
object
S
log
to
Y
log
factors
[necessarily
uniquely!]

the
given
monomorphism

Also,
we
introduce
some
new
terminology
as
follows:
Deﬁnition
1.2.
In
the
notation
of
the
above
discussion:
(i)
Let
n
∈
N.
Then
we
shall
say
that
Y
log
is
of
rank
≤
n
(respectively,
of
rank
n)
and
write
rk(Y
log
)
≤
n
(respectively,
rk(Y
log
)
=
n)
if
every
ﬁber
of
PY
at
a
geometric
point
of
Y
is
of
rank
≤
n
(respectively,
rank
n)
[cf.
the
discussion
entitled
“Generalities
on
monoids”
in
§0].
We
shall
say
that
Y
log
is
submonic
if
it
is
of
rank
≤
1.
If
Y
log
is
locally
noetherian,
then
we
deﬁne
the
submonic
dimension
of
Y
log
to
be
the
supremum
def
dimsm
(Y
log
)
=
sup
Z
log
Y
log
dim(Z)
∈
N
∪
{−∞,
+∞}
—
where
Z
log

Y
log
ranges
over
the
monomorphisms
of
Schlog
(Y
log
)
such
that
Z
log
is
submonic,
and
“dim(Z)”
denotes
the
scheme-theoretic
dimension
of
the
underlying
locally
noetherian
scheme
Z
of
Z
log
.
Thus,
the
submonic
dimension
is
equal
to
−∞
if
and
only
if
it
holds
that
the
underlying
scheme
of
every
“Z
log
”
that
appears
in
the
supremum
of
the
above
display
is
the
empty
scheme.
We
shall
say
that
Y
log
is
log-nodal
if
it
is
reduced,
one-pointed,
split,
and
of
rank
two.
(ii)
Suppose
that
Y
log
arises
from
an
object
Y
log
→
X
log
of
Schlog
(X
log
).
Then
a
minimal
point
Z
log

Y
log
of
Y
log
is
deﬁned
to
be
a
monomorphism
Z
log

Y
log
of
Schlog
(X
log
)
such
that
Z
log
is
a
minimal
object
of
Schlog
(X
log
).
Thus,
a
minimal
point
of
Y
log
may
be
thought
of
as
an
object
of
Schlog
(Y
log
).
We
shall
write
MinPt(Y
log
)
for
the
set
of
isomorphism
classes
[i.e.,
as
objects
of
Schlog
(Y

points
of
Y

The

the

Suppose

log
log
f
:Z

a
morphism

Thus,
the

is

under

(respectively,

(ii)
Let

be
a
morphism
of
ﬁnitely
generated,
saturated
monoids
such
that
the
induced
morphism
M

Then
the

(iii)
If

then
the

and
that
the

Then

Proof.
Assertions
(i)
and
(v)
follow
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions.
Next,
before
proceeding,
let
us
recall
that,
for
instance
in
the
case
of
the
log
scheme
Y
log
,
(∗sys
)
the
sheaf
of
monoids
that
deﬁnes
the

be
thought
of

the

to

of

certain

of
line
bundles
[i.e.,
a
system
of
Gm

parametrized
by
the
sheaf
of
abelian
groups
PYgp
.
Now
assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
(∗sys
).
Assertion
(iii)
follows
from
the
argument
given
in
the
proof
of
[LgSch],
Proposition
2.3
[but
cf.
Remark
1.4.1
below!]:
That
is
to
say,
one
reduces
immediately
to
the
case
where
Z
and
Y
are
equal
to
Spec(k)
for
some
ﬁeld
k;
then,
under
the
assumption
that
the
asserted
surjectivity
fails
to
hold,
one
constructs
scheme-like
morphisms
W
log

Z

where
W

an

the

that

Assertion
(iv)
follows
immediately
from
the
simple
and
well-understood
structure
of
the
monoid
N.
Assertion
(vi)
follows
formally
from
assertions
(iii),
(iv),
and

Finally,
assertion

follows
from
the
deﬁnitions,
together
with
the
observation

discussed

Remark
1.4.1.
Suppose
that
we
are
in
the
situation
of
Proposition
1.4.
Then
in
general,
it
is
not
necessarily
the
case
that
the
assumption
that
f
log
is
a
monomorphism
in
Schlog
(X

implies
that
f
is
a
monomorphism
in
Sch(X).
That
is
to
say,
the
corresponding
portion
of
the
necessity
asserted
in
[LgSch],
Proposition
2.3,
is
false
as
stated.
Such
an
example
may
be
obtained
by
considering
the
monomorphism
constructed
in
Proposition
1.4,
(ii),
in
the
case
where
the

i.e.,
in

case
the

a
“blow-up

that

with

Proof.
Since
P
gp
is
a
ﬁnitely
generated
free
abelian
group,
assertion
(i)
follows
immediately
from
the
assumption
that
the
action
of
Gk
on
P
is
trivial,
together
with
the
well-known
fact
from
elementary
Galois
theory
[i.e.,
Hilbert’s
“Theorem
90”]
that
H
1
(Gk
,
(k
sep
)×
)
=
0.
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
The
existence
of
φ
follows
immediately
from
[LgSch],
Lemma
2.5,
(iii),
i.e.,
by
considering
the
[ﬁnite!]
sum
of
the
Gk
-conjugates
of
a
positive
homomorphism
P
→
N
of
the
sort
discussed
in
[LgSch],
Lemma
2.5,
(iii);
the
existence
of
ψ
then
follows
by
applying
[LgSch],
Lemma
2.5,
(iii),
to
two
distinct
elements
of
P
that
map,
via
φ,
to
the
same
nonzero
element
of
N.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
First,
we
observe
that
the
ﬁnal
portion
of
assertion
(iii)
concerning
τ
∈
Gk
follows
immediately
from
the
property
in
the
display
of
assertion
(iii)
by
taking
ζ
:
Q
→
R
to
be
the
identity
automorphism
of
Q.
Next,
we
observe
that
the
homomorphisms
φ
and
ψ
of
assertion
(ii)
determine
a
positive
homomorphism
(φ,
ψ)
:
P
→
N
⊕
N
whose
image
I
⊆
N
⊕
N
generates
a
rank
two
subgroup
I
gp
of
Ngp
⊕
Ngp
=
Z
⊕
Z.
Thus,
for
some
positive
integer
n,
it
def
holds
that
n
·
Ngp
⊕
n
·
Ngp
⊆
I
gp
.
In
particular,
we
have
n
·
N
⊕
n
·
N
⊆
Q
=
I
gp
∩
(N
⊕
N)
⊆
N
⊕
N;
I
⊆
Q;
Qgp
=
I
gp
[since
I
gp
⊆
Qgp
⊆
I
gp
].
One
veriﬁes
immediately
that
this
implies
that
this
monoid
Q
⊆
N
⊕
N
is
an
fs
monoid
of
rank
two.
Write
ξ
:
P
→
Q
for
the
resulting
positive
homomorphism
of
monoids.
Note
that
ξ
induces
a
surjection
on
groupiﬁcations
ξ
gp
:
P
gp

Qgp
(=
I
gp
).
Now
suppose
that
ζ
:
Q
→
R
is
a
positive
homomorphism
of
fs
monoids
of
rank
≥
1
and
σ
∈
Gk
such
that
the
composite
homomorphism
ζ
◦
ξ
◦
σ
:
P
→
R
factors
as
the
composite
ζσ
◦
ξ
of
ξ
:
P
→
Q
with
some
positive
homomorphism
ζσ
:
Q
→
R;
in
the
following,
we
shall
show
that
σ
stabilizes
the
subquotient
P
gp

Qgp
⊇
Q
and
induces
the
identity
on
Q.
Here,
we
note
that,
by
applying
assertion
(ii)
in
the
case
where
we
take
“P
”,
“k”,
and
“M
gp
”
to
be
R,
k
sep
,
and
Rgp
×
(k
sep
)×
,
respectively,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
R
=
N.
Also,
by
replacing
R
by
a
suitable
submonoid
of
R,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
ζ,
ζσ
induce
surjections
ζ
gp
,
ζσgp
:
Qgp

Rgp
=
Ngp
=
Z.
Next,
let
us
observe
that,
by
restricting
the
ﬁrst
projection
N
⊕
N

N
to
Q
⊆
N
⊕
N,
one
may
regard
φ
:
P
→
N
as
the
composite
η
◦
ξ
of
ξ
:
P
→
Q
with
a
homomorphism
of
monoids
η
:
Q
→
N.
Since
η
vanishes
on
0
⊕
n
·
N
⊆
Q,
it
follows
that
η
is
not

positive,
and
hence
that
Ker(η
gp
)
=
Ker(ζ
gp
),
Ker(η
gp
)
=
Ker(ζσgp
).
Since
ξ
gp
is
def
def
surjective,
we
thus
conclude
that,
if
we
write
θ
=
ζ
◦ξ,
θσ
=
ζσ
◦ξ,
then
Ker(φgp
)
=
Ker(θgp
),
Ker(φgp
)
=
Ker(θσgp
),
and
hence
that
both
Ker(φgp
)
∩
Ker(θgp
)
⊆
P
gp
and
Ker(φgp
)
∩
Ker(θσgp
)
⊆
P
gp
are
submodules
of
rank
rk(P
gp
)
−
2
that
contain
Ker(ξ
gp
).
Since
Ker(ξ
gp
)
is
also
a
submodule
of
P
gp
of
rank
rk(P
gp
)
−
2,
we
thus
∼
conclude
[since
P
gp
/Ker(ξ
gp
)
→
Qgp
is
torsion-free]
that
Ker(φgp
)
∩
Ker(θgp
)
=
Ker(φgp
)
∩
Ker(θσgp
)
=
Ker(ξ
gp
).
But,
since
φ
is
Gk
-equivariant,
this
implies
that
Ker(ξ
gp
)
is
stabilized
by
σ,
i.e.,
that
σ
induces
an
automorphism
of
the
quotient
ξ
gp
:
P
gp

Qgp
,
as
well
as
of
the
quotient
η
gp
:
Qgp

Ngp
=
Z,
and
maps
the
quotient
ζ
gp
:
Qgp

Ngp
=
Z
to
the
quotient
ζσgp
:
Qgp

Ngp
=
Z.
Now
to
complete
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii),
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
σ
induces
the
identity
on
Qgp
.
Thus,
we
suppose
that
σ
does
not
induce
the
identity
on
Qgp
.
Then
since
σ
clearly
stabilizes
the
fs
monoid
of
rank
two
obtained
by
forming
the
saturation
of
the
image
of
ξ
:
P
→
Q
in
Q
[cf.
[LgSch],
Lemma
2.5,
(ii)],
it
follows
[cf.
the
discussion
entitled
“Rank
two
fs
monoids”
in
§0]
that
σ
acts
on
Qgp
as
an
automorphism
of
order
2,
and
hence
that
σ
permutes
the
quotients
determined
by
ζ
gp
,
ζσgp
.
In
particular,
σ
stabilizes
the
kernel
of
the
homomorphism
gp
:
Qgp
→
Z
determined
by
the
positive
homomorphism
ζ+
:
on
groupiﬁcations
ζ+
Q
→
N
obtained
by
forming
the
sum
of
ζ,
ζσ
.
Since
σ
acts
nontrivially
on
Qgp
,
gp
)
=
Ker(η
gp
).
Thus,
the
positivity
of
ζ+
contradicts
the
this
implies
that
Ker(ζ+
non-positivity
of
η.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii).
Next,
we
observe
that
assertions
(iv),
(v),
(vii),
and
(viii)
are
immediate
consequences
of
the
well-known
correspondence
between
the
theory
of
log
schemes
and
the
classical
theory
of
toric
varieties.
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(vi).
First
of
all,
log
[ξ],
given
an
object
Z
log
of
Schlog
(S
log
)
and
two
S
log
-morphisms
α
:
Z
log
→
S+
log
β
:
Z
log
→
S+
[ξ],
to
verify
that
α
=
β,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
α
and
β
coincide
after
base-change
from
k
to
k
sep
.
Moreover,
since
the
morphism
SH
→
S
is
ﬁnite
log
log
étale,
and
the
morphism
S+
[ξ]

SH
is
already
known
to
be
a
monomorphism,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
Z
log
is
reduced
and
one-pointed
—
an
assumption
which
reduces
the
assertion
under
consideration
to
an
assertion
concerning
fs
monoids,
i.e.,
the
assertion
that
if,
for
some
σ
∈
Gk
,
there
exist
positive
homomorphisms
of
fs
monoids
ζ
:
Q
→
R
and
ζσ
:
Q
→
R
such
that
ζ
◦
ξ
◦
σ
=
ζσ
◦
ξ
:
P
→
R,
then
σ
stabilizes
the
subquotient
P
gp

Qgp
⊇
Q
determined
by
ξ.
But
this
assertion
concerning
fs
monoids
follows
immediately,
i.e.,
if
one
assumes
either
that
rk(Q)
=
1
or
that
ξ
satisﬁes
the
properties
stated
in
(iii).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(vi).
Finally,
we
observe
that
assertion
(ix)
may
be
veriﬁed
by
a
similar
argument
to
the
argument
applied
in
the
proof
of
assertion
(vi).

in
Schlog
(X

)
with
codomain
equal
to
Y
log
[and
domain
given
by
some
minimal
object].
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
Observe
that
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
Y
log
is
reduced
and
one-pointed
[cf.
[LgSch],
Proposition
1.1,
(i)],
and
hence
that
the
underlying
scheme
Y
of
Y
log
may
be
written
in
the
form
Spec(kY
),
for
a
suitable
ﬁeld
kY
.
Next,
let
us
consider
the
situation
discussed
in
Lemma
1.5,
(v),
in
the
case
where
·
one
takes
the
data
that
gives
rise
to
“S
log
”
to
be
the
data
that
arises
from
Y
log
[so
“k”
corresponds
to
kY
];
·
if
rk(Y
log
)
=
0,
then
one
takes
the
positive
homomorphism
“ξ”
to
be
the
identity
morphism;
·
if
rk(Y
log
)
≥
1,
then
one
takes
the
positive
homomorphism
“ξ”
to
be
the
homomorphism
“φ
:
P
→
N”
of
Lemma
1.5,
(ii).
Then
one
veriﬁes
immediately
from
the
description
of
the
torus
“T
[ξ]red
”
in
Lemma
1.5,
(iv),
that
any
splitting
as
in
Lemma
1.5,
(i),
over
a
suitable
ﬁnite
separable
extension
of
k
—
which,
in
the
terminology
of
[ExtFam],
Deﬁnition
1.3,
may
be
regarded
as
a
“Galois-equivariant
clean
chart”
—
determines
a
closed
point
of
S[ξ].
In
particular,
by
restricting
the
log
structure
of
the
submonic
log
scheme
S
log
[ξ]
to
this
closed
point,
we
obtain,
by
Proposition
1.4,
(vii);
Lemma
1.5,
(vi),
a
monomorphism
f
log
:
Z
log
→
Y
log
in
Schlog
(X
log
),
for
some
submonic
Z
log
.
Since,
by
[LgSch],
Proposition
2.4,
(ii),
(iii),
Z
log
is
necessarily
minimal,
we
thus
conclude
that
the
morphism
f
log
determines
a
minimal
point
of
Y
log
,
as
desired.
In
a
similar
vein,
if
Y
log
is
not
submonic
[i.e.,
is
of
rank
n
≥
2],
then
we
consider
the
situation
discussed
in
Lemma
1.5,
(v),
in
the
case
where
one
takes
the
data
that
gives
rise
to
“S
log
”
to
be
the
data
that
arises
from
Y
log
[so
“k”
corresponds
to
kY
],
and
one
takes
the

positive
homomorphism
“ξ”
to
be
the
homomorphism
“ψ
:
P
→
N”
of
Lemma
1.5,
(ii).
Then
a
splitting
as
in
Lemma
1.5,
(i),
over
a
suitable
ﬁnite
separable
extension
of
k
determines
a
closed
point
of
S[ξ]
whose
residue
ﬁeld
kW
is
a
ﬁnite
separable
extension
ﬁeld
of
kY
.
Now,
by
restricting
the
log
structure
of
the
submonic
log
scheme
S
log
[ξ]
to
this
closed
point,
we
obtain,
by
Proposition
1.4,
(vii);
Lemma
1.5,
(vi),
a
monomorphism
W
log
→
Y
log
in
Schlog
(X
log
),
for
some
submonic
W
log
whose
underlying
scheme
W
is
equal
to
Spec(kW
),
which
determines,
by
[LgSch],
Proposition
2.4,
(iii),
a
minimal
point
of
Y
log
that
is
not
isomorphic
to
f
log
:
Z
log
→
Y
log
.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
The
suﬃciency
portion
of
assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
[LgSch],
Proposition
2.4,
(ii),
(iii).
Thus,
to
complete
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii),
it
suﬃces
to
verify
the
necessity
portion
of
assertion
(ii).
To
this
end,
suppose
that
Y
log
is
minimal.
Then
it
follows
from
[LgSch],
Proposition
2.4,
(i),
that
Y
log
is
reduced
and
one-pointed,
i.e.,
that
Y
=
Spec(kY
),
for
some
ﬁeld
kY
,
and
hence,
from
assertion
(i),
that
there
exists
a
minimal
point
f
log
:
Z
log
→
Y
log
in
Schlog
(X
log
),
for
some
submonic
Z
log
.
If
Y
log
is
not
submonic,
then
it
follows
that
f
log
is
not
an
isomorphism,
i.e.,
in
contradiction
to
the
assumed
minimality
of
Y
log
.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
First,
let
us
observe
that
it
follows
from
assertion
(ii)
that
the
underlying
scheme
Y
(respectively,
Z)
of
Y
log
(respectively,
Z
log
)
may
be
written
in
the
form
Spec(kY
)
(respectively,
Spec(kZ
)),
for
a
suitable
ﬁeld
kY
(respectively,
kZ
).
Then
if
Y
log
is
of
rank
one,
then
the
ﬁniteness
of
MinLg(f
log
)
follows
immediately
by
considering
the
ﬁniteness
of
the
extension
degree
[kZ
:
kY
],
together
with
the
simple,
well-understood
structure
of
the
monoid
N.
On
the
other
hand,
if
Y
log
is
of
rank
zero,
but
Z
log
is
of
rank
one,
then
the
fact
that
MinLg(f
log
)
=
+∞
follows
by
considering
the
inﬁnite
descending
sequence
of
submonoids
N

.
.
.
⊇
2n
·
N

,
for

This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii).

Proposition
1.7.
(Monomorphisms

Suppose
that
Y
log

of
Schlog

Then
there
exists
a

object
Z

that

a

Proof.
As
in

of

one
veriﬁes
immediately
that

may
assume

Now

takes
the

homomorphism
“ξ”
to
be
the

“ξ

of
Lemma
1.5,
(iii).
Then
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
any
splitting
as
in
Lemma
1.5,
(i),
over
a
suitable
ﬁnite
separable
extension
of
k
determines
a
closed
point
of
S[ξ]
whose
residue
ﬁeld

a

such

(Submonic

Suppose

Then

if

one.
Proof.
First,
we

Then
it
follows
that
Yred
[cf.
the
discussion
entitled
“Log

in
§0]
is
reduced,
log
one-pointed,
and
submonic,
hence,
by
Proposition
1.6,
(ii),
that
Yred
is
minimal.
Since
any

by
Proposition

factors
uniquely
through
Yred

we
thus

conclude
that

and
that
the
unique
element

from

This
completes
the
proof
of

Next,
we
verify
suﬃciency.
Suppose
that

of
cardinality
one.
Then

we
conclude

one-pointed.
Thus,
by
applying
the
ﬁnal
portion
of
Proposition

to

we
conclude
that
Y

Before
proceeding,
we
review
a
well-known
consequence
of
the
general
theory
of
fs
log
schemes.
Lemma
1.9.
(Specialization
morphisms
associated
to
characteristic
sheaves)
Suppose
that
the
underlying
scheme
Y
of
Y
log
is
the
spectrum
of
a
strict
henselian
domain
A.
Write
s
for
the
tautological
geometric
point
of
Y
associated
to
the
unique
closed
point
of
Y
.
Let
η
be
a
geometric
point
of
Y
whose
image
in
Y
is
the
unique
generic
point
of
Y
.
In
the
following,
we
shall
use
subscripted
“s’s”
and
“η’s”
to
denote
the
respective
ﬁbers
at
s,
η
of
sheaves
on
the
étale
site
of
Y
.
Then
the
natural
“specialization
morphism”
PY,s
→
PY,η
is
surjective.
In
particular,
this
specialization
morphism
is
an
isomorphism
if
and
only
if
rk(PY,s
)
=
rk(PY,η
).
Finally,
if
rk(PY,η

≥
1,
and
a

a

where

then,
in
light
of
the

of
the

it
follows
immediately
from
the
discussion
of

in

that
a

On
the
other
hand,
if
we
write

for
the

then
it
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
the

that
the

[cf.

1.2,

that

In
particular,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of

that
Z
log
=

Thus,
it
follows
immediately
from
Lemma
1.9
that

constant.
Next,
by
replacing
Y

one
veriﬁes
immediately
we
may

that

Now
the
case
where

is
immediate
[cf.
Proposition

so
we
may
assume
without

that

Thus,
we
may
apply
the
theory
reviewed
in

to
the

Moreover,
one
veriﬁes

In
particular,
by
applying
Lemma

where
we
take

is

[i.e.,
a
“submonically

if
f

is

there
exists
a

[“lifting”]
morphism

that
renders
the
two
resulting
triangles
in
the

commutative.
Proposition
2.2.
(SLEM
morphisms
and
open
immersions)
Let
f
log
:
Z
log
→
Y
log
be
a
morphism
of
Schlog
(X
log
).
Thus,
the
underlying
morphism
f
:
Z
→
Y
of
f
log
may
be
regarded
as
a
morphism
of
Sch(X).
Then:
(i)
If
f
log
is
an
open
immersion
[cf.
the
discussion
entitled
“Log
schemes”
in
§0],
then
f
log
is
SLEM.
(ii)
If
Y
log
is
submonic,
and
f
log
is
SLEM,
then
f
log
is
an
open
immersion.
Proof.
First,
let
us
observe
that
any
monomorphism
between
one-pointed
objects
in
Sch(X)
is
necessarily
a
closed
immersion
between
spectra
of
artinian
rings
[cf.,
e.g.,
the
proof
of
[LgSch],
Corollary
1.2].
In
particular,
it
follows
from
Proposition
1.4,
(vi),
that
any
monomorphism
V
log
→
W
log
as
in
Deﬁnition
2.1
is
necessarily
scheme-like,
and,
moreover,
that
the
underlying
morphism
of
schemes
associated
to
any
monomorphism
V
log
→
W
log
as
in
Deﬁnition
2.1
is
necessarily
a
closed
immersion
between
spectra
of
artinian
rings.
Thus,
it
is
immediate
that
if
f
log
is
an
open
immersion,
then
f
log
is
SLEM.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Now
suppose
that
Y
log
is
submonic,
and
f
log
is
SLEM.
Thus,
it
follows
from
Proposition
1.4,
(vi),
that
f
log
is
scheme-like,
and,
moreover,
that
f
is
a
monomorphism
in
Sch(X).
In
particular,
the
existence
of
unique
liftings
as
stipulated
in
Deﬁnition
2.1
implies
that
f
is
an
étale
monomorphism
in
Sch(X),
hence
[cf.,
e.g.,
[LgSch],
Corollary
1.3]
an
open
immersion.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).

Proposition
2.3.
(Connectedness

(i)
Let
S

of

(X

)
[cf.
Proposition
1.3];
U

,
{Vilog

through

and,
moreover,
the
ﬁber
product
U

is
empty.
Then

is
injective.
(ii)
In
the
situation
of
(i),
suppose
further
that
S
log
is
submonic.
Then
the
natural
map
of
(i)
is
never
surjective.
(iii)
Suppose
that
S
log
is
a
log-nodal
object
of
Schlog
(X
log
).
Then,
for
suitable
choices
of
U
log

S
log
and
{Vilog

S
log
}i∈N
as
in
(i),
the
natural
map
of
(i)
is
surjective.
(iv)
Let
T
log
be
an
object
of
Schlog
(X
log
).
Then
T
log
is
non-submonic
if
and
only
if
there
exist
morphisms
U
log

S
log
and
{Vilog

S
log
}i∈N
as
in
(i),
together
with
a
monomorphism
S
log

T
log
in
Schlog
(X
log
),
such
that
the
natural
map
of
(i)
is
surjective.
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
Let
i
∈
N.
Then
the
injectivity
of
each
of
the
natural
maps
MinPt(U
log
)
→
MinPt(S
log
),
MinPt(Vilog
)
→
MinPt(S
log
)
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
“MinPt(−)”.
The
fact
that
the
images
of
these
two
maps
are
disjoint
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
“MinPt(−)”,
together
with
the
assumption
that
the
ﬁber
product
U
log
×S
log
Vilog
is
empty.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
Since
S
log
is
submonic,
it
follows
from
Proposition
2.2,
(ii),
that
the
morphisms
U
log

S
log
,
{Vilog

S
log
}i∈N
are
open
immersions.
Since
[the
underlying
scheme
of]
S
log
is
connected,
it
thus
follows
from
the
assumption
that
the
objects
U
log
,
{Vilog
}i∈N
are
nonempty,
whereas
the
ﬁber
products
{U
log
×S
log
Vilog
}i∈N
are
empty,
that
the
open
subscheme
of
S
log
determined
by
the
union
of
the
images
of
the
morphisms
U
log

S
log
,
{Vilog

S
log
}i∈N
does
not
coincide
with
S
log
,
and
hence
[cf.
Proposition
1.6,
(i)]
that
the
natural
map
of
(i)
is
not
surjective.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
First,
let
us
observe
that,
in
light
of
the
various
assumptions
imposed
on
S
log
,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
S
log
may
be
regarded
as
the
“S
log
”
that
appears
in
Lemma
1.5,
(viii).
Here,
the
positive
homomorphism
φ0
:
P
→
J0
=
N
of
Lemma
1.5,
(viii),
may
be
taken
to
be
the
positive
homomorphism
“φ”
of
Lemma
1.5,
(ii).
In
particular,
we
also
obtain
homomorphisms
φ1
:
P
→
J1
and
φ2
:
P
→
J2
.
Now
we
apply
Example
0.1,
where
we
take
“P
”
to
be
P
and
“∞
P
”
to
be
J2
.
This
yields
an
inﬁnite
descending
sequence
P
⊆

where
i

—
of
submonoids
of
P

satisfying
various
properties
as
described
in
Example

Suppose
that,
for
i

N,
i
P
is
obtained
as
the
bisecting
monoid
of
P
at
a
positive
homomorphism
i
ψ0
:
P

that
is
assigned
the
index
“2”.
Thus,

S


S

of
Lemma
1.5,
(vii),
(viii)
[where
we
take

In
particular,
it
follows
from
the
fact
that
S

×S

S
log
[φ{0,2}

=
S
log
[φ{0}
]
[cf.
Lemma
1.5,
(vii),
(viii)],
together
with
the
discussion
of
Example
0.1,
that
the
ﬁber
product
S
log
[φ{0,1}
]
×S
log
S
log
[i

]
is
empty.
Thus,
in
summary,
if
we
take
U
log

S
log
to
be
the
morphism
S
log
[φ{0,1}
]

S

and,
for
i

Vilog

S
log
to
be
the
morphism
S
log
[i

]

S
log
discussed
above,
then
we
obtain
data
as
in
assertion
(i).
Note,
moreover,
that
it
follows
immediately
from
the
discussion
of
Example
0.1
that
the
natural
map
of
assertion
(i)
is
surjective,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii).
Finally,
we
observe
that
the
suﬃciency
(respectively,
necessity)
portion
of
assertion
(iv)
follows
formally
from
assertion
(ii)
(respectively,
(iii)),
together
with
Proposition
1.4,
(vi)
(respectively,
together
with
Proposition

applied

This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iv).

Proposition
2.4.
(Characterization
of
scheme-like
morphisms
between
minimal
objects)
Let
hlog
:
T
log
→
S
log
be
a
morphism
between
minimal
objects
def
of
Schlog
(X
log
).
Set
r
=
rk(S
log
)
∈
{0,
1}
[cf.
Proposition
1.6,
(ii)].
Then
hlog
is
scheme-like
if
and
only
if
there
exists
a
connected,
submonic
object
Z
log
of
Schlog
(X
log
)
such
that
the
domain
of
every
minimal
point
of
Z
log
is
of
rank
r,
and,
moreover,
hlog
admits
a
factorization
T
log
→
Z
log
→
S
log
as
the
composite
of
a
minimal
point
T

Z

of

log
[i.e.,
such
that
the
composite
S
log
→
Z
log
→
S
log
is
the
identity
morphism].
Proof.
First,
we
observe
that
since
the
underlying
morphism
of
schemes
T
→
S
necessarily
arises
from
[i.e.,
by
applying
“Spec(−)”
to]
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
ﬁelds,
def
log
[i.e.,
N
the
asserted
necessity
follows
immediately
by
taking
Z
log
=
AN
Z
×Z
S
log
dimensional
aﬃne
space
over
S
,
for
a
suitable
positive
integer
N
].
Here,
we
note
that
the
fact
that
“the
domain
of
every
minimal
point
of
this
Z
log
is
of
rank
r”
follows
immediately
from
Proposition
1.4,
(vi).
Thus,
it
remains
to
verify
suﬃciency.
First,
let
us
observe
that
it
follows
from
the
manifestly
constructible
nature
of
the
characteristic
sheaf
PZ
[cf.
also
Propositions
1.4,
(vi);
1.6,
(i),
(ii)]
that
the
assumption
that
“the
domain
of
every
minimal
point
of
Z
log
is
of
rank
r”
implies
that
Z
log
itself
is
of
rank
r,
and
hence
[cf.
Lemma
1.9]
that
the
characteristic
sheaf
PZ
is
26
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
locally
constant.
Since
the
monoids
0
and
N
have
no
nontrivial
automorphisms,
we
thus
conclude
that
the
characteristic
sheaf
PZ
is
constant,
with
ﬁbers
isomorphic
to
the
monoid
0
(respectively,
N)
if
r
=
0
(respectively,
r
=
1).
The
existence
of
the
section
S
log
→
Z
log
thus
implies
that
the
morphism
Z
log
→
S
log
is
scheme-like.
Since
the
monomorphism
T
log

Z
log
is
also
scheme-like
[cf.

we
thus
conclude
that

scheme-like,

Thus,
[cf.

and
only
if

Suppose

Then

Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
The
preservation
of
(i-a)
is
a
matter
of
general
nonsense.
The
preservation
of
(i-b)
follows
from
Proposition
1.3,
(i).
The
preservation
of
(i-c)
follows
from
Proposition
1.3,
(ii).
The
preservation
of
(i-d)
and
(i-e)
follows
immediately
from
the
preservation
of
(i-a).
The
preservation
of
(i-f)
follows
immediately,
in
light
of
Proposition
1.8,
from
the
preservation
of
(i-e).
The
preservation
of
(i-g)
follows
immediately,
in
light
of
Proposition
1.6,
(iii),
from
the
preservation
of
(i-d).
The
preservation
of
(i-h)
follows
immediately
from
the
preservation
of
(i-a)
and
(i-f).
The
preservation
of
(i-i)
follows
immediately,
in
light
of
Proposition
2.3,
(iv),
from
the
preservation
of
(i-a),
(i-b),
(i-c),
(i-e),
and
(i-h).
The
preservation
of
(i-j)
follows
immediately,
in
light
of
Proposition
2.4,
from
the
preservation
of
(i-c),
(i-d),
(i-e),
(i-g),
and
(i-i).
The
preservation
of
(i-k)
follows
immediately,
in
light
of
Proposition
2.5,
from
the
preservation
of
(i-e),
(i-i),
and
(i-j).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i),
except
for
the
veriﬁcation
of
the
preservation
of
(i-l).
Assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
[i.e.,
in
the
spirit
of
[LgSch],
Corollary
2.15]
from
the
portion
of
assertion
(i)
concerning
the
preservation
of
(i-k).
Here,
we
note
that
the
functoriality
of
the
isomorphism
of
schemes
in
the
ﬁnal
display
in
the
statement
of
assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
the
characterization
given

of

discussed
in
Proposition
1.11,
(i),
together
with
the

discussed
in

1.11,
(iii).
Finally,
the
portion
of
assertion
(i)
concerning
the

of

follows
from
the
portion
of
assertion
(i)
concerning

(i-i),
together
with
the
isomorphisms
of

Proof.
First,
let
us
observe
that,
by
Lemma
1.5,
(ii),
there
exists
a
positive
homomorphism
φ†
:
P
→
N.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
if
p
is
a
prime
number,
then
given
a
surjective
homomorphism
ζ
:
P
gp

Fp
,
there
exists
a
homomorphism
ζ
:
P
gp
→
Z
whose
composite
with
the
natural
surjection
Z

Fp
is
equal
to
ζ.
[Indeed,
this
follows
immediately
from
the
fact
that
P
gp
is
a
ﬁnitely
generated
free
abelian
group
—
cf.
the
discussion
entitled
“Generalities
on
monoids”
in
§0.]
In
particular,
it
follows
from
the
fact
that
P
is
a
ﬁnitely
generated
monoid
that,
for
suﬃciently
large
n
∈
N,
the
homomorphism
(ζ
+
pn
·
(φ†
)gp
)
:
P
gp
→
Z
coincides
with
ζ
when
composed
with
the
natural
surjection
Z

Fp
and,
moreover,
determines
a
positive
homomorphism
φ
:
P
→
N.
In
particular,
it
follows
from
the
hypotheses
imposed
on
ξ
that
φ
admits
a
factorization
P
→
Q
→
N
as
a
composite
of
ξ
with
a
positive
homomorphism
ψ
:
Q
→
N.
Since
the
resulting
composite
P
gp
→
Qgp
→
Z

Fp
coincides
with
ζ,
we
thus
conclude,
by
allowing
p
and
ζ
to
vary,
that
the
reduction
of
the
homomorphism
of
ﬁnitely
generated
free
abelian
groups
ξ
gp
:
P
gp
→
Qgp
modulo
any
prime
number
is
injective,
and,
hence,
since
rk(P
)
≥
rk(Q),
that
ξ
gp
:
P
gp
→
Qgp
is
an
isomorphism.
That
is
to
say,
P
and
Q
may
be
regarded
as
ﬁnitely
generated
saturated
monoids
within
a
single
Z-module
∼
P
gp
→
Qgp
.
In
particular,
it
follows
from
well-known
properties
of
fs
monoids
[cf.,
e.g.,
[LgSch],
Lemma
2.5,
(iv)]
that
the
hypotheses
imposed
on
ξ
imply
that
ξ
is
an
isomorphism,
as
desired.

Proof.
First
of
all,
we
observe
that
the
asserted
necessity
follows
immediately
from
Proposition
1.10,
together
with
the
deﬁnition
of
the
term
“scheme-like”.
Thus,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
the
suﬃciency
of
the
condition
that
appears
in
the
statement
of
Proposition
2.8.
To
this
end,
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
it
follows
[cf.
Proposition
1.6,
(ii)]
from
the
assumption
that
Z
log
and
Y
log
are
non-minimal
that
rk(Z
log
)
≥
2,
rk(Y

≥
2.
Thus,
it
follows
from
Proposition
1.10
that
rk(Z

)
=
dimsm
(Z
log
)
+
1
≤
dimsm
(Y

+
1
=
rk(Y

Next,
let
us
observe
—
i.e.,
by
applying
Lemma
1.5,
(v),
as
in
the
proof
of
Proposition
1.6,
(i)
—
that
the
condition
under

that

that
this

in

an

that

Proof.
First,
we
observe
that
assertion
(i)
follows
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved
[cf.
also
[LgSch],
Proposition
1.1,
(i)].
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
First,
we
recall
from
[LgSch],
Proposition
1.1,
(ii),
that
an
object
of
Sch(X)
is
minimal
if
and
only
if
it
is
reduced
and
one-pointed.
Next,
we
recall
from
Proposition
1.6,
(ii),
that
a
minimal
object
of
Schlog
(X
log
)
is
necessarily
reduced
and
one-pointed.
Now
the
implication
(ii-a)
=⇒
(ii-b)
follows
immediately.
In
a
similar
vein,
the
implication
(ii-a)
=⇒
(ii-c)
follows
immediately,
by
applying
Proposition
1.6,
(i).
To
verify
the
implications
(ii-b)
=⇒
(ii-a),
(ii-c)
=⇒
(ii-a),
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
if
U
is
a
one-pointed
object
of
Sch(X),
then
the
image
via
any
morphism
U
→
Z
of
Sch(X)
of
the
unique
point
of
U
is
a
locally
closed
point
of
Z.
Note
that,
by
considering
the
schematic
closure
of
such
a
morphism
in
a
suitable
aﬃne
open
of
Z,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
U
and
Z
are
aﬃne,
and
that
the
morphism
[of
ﬁnite
type!]
U
→
Z
has
dense
image.
Since
this
image
[which
consists
of
a
single
point!]
is
necessarily
constructible,
hence
contains
a
dense
open
subset
of
the
underlying
topological
space
of
Z,
we
thus
conclude
that
we
may
assume,
after
replacing
Z
by
a
suitable
aﬃne
open
of
Z,
that
the
morphism
U
→
Z
is
surjective,
i.e.,
that
Z
is
one-pointed.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
Since
minimal
objects
of
Schlog
(X
log
)
are
necessarily
one-pointed
[cf.
Proposition
1.6,
(ii)],
the
necessity
portion
of
the
asserted
equivalence
follows
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved.
Thus,
it
sufﬁces
to
verify
the
suﬃciency
portion
of
the
asserted
equivalence.
To
this
end,
let
us

ﬁrst
observe
that,
since
minimal
objects
of

[cf.

1.6,

we
may
assume
without

Z
log
is
reduced
and
one-pointed.
Also,
by
base-changing
to
a
suitable
ﬁnite
extension

the
ﬁeld

we
conclude
that
we

is
split.
Thus,
by
considering
a
suitable
splitting
as
in
Lemma
1.5,
(i),
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that,
to
complete
the
proof
of
suﬃciency,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
the
following
assertion
concerning
fs
monoids:
Let
P
be
an
fs
monoid.
For
i
=
1,
2,
let
φi
:
P
→
N
be
a
positive
homomorphism
of
fs
monoids.
Then
there
exist
an
fs
monoid
Q
of
rank
two
and
a
positive
homomorphism
ψ
:
P
→
Q
of
fs
monoids
such
that,
for
i
=
1,
2,
the
homomorphism
2
·
φi
:
P
→
N
[i.e.,
the
composite
of
φi
with
the
positive
homomorphism
N
→
N
given
by
multiplication
by
2]
admits
a
factorization
P
→
Q
→
N
as
the
composite
of
ψ
with
some
positive
homomorphism
ψi
:
Q
→
N.
This
assertion
concerning
fs
monoids
may
be
veriﬁed
as
follows.
For
i
=
1,
2,
gp
→
Z.
If
N1gp
=
N2gp
,
write
Nigp
⊆
P
gp
for
the
kernel
of
the
morphism
φgp
i
:
P
then
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
one
obtains
data
as
desired
by
considering
the
factorization
N
→
N
⊕
N
→
N
[i.e.,
determined
by
the
assignments
N

1
→
(1,
1)
∈
N
⊕
N
and
N
⊕
N

(a,
b)
→
a
+
b
∈
N]
of
the
homomorphism
N
→
N
given
by
multiplication
by
2.
Thus,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
N1gp
=
N2gp
.
Write
Q
for
the
saturation
[cf.
[LgSch],
Lemma
2.5,
(ii)]
of
the
image
of
P
in
(P
gp
/N1gp
)
⊕
(P
gp
/N2gp
)
(∼
=
Z
⊕
Z).
Thus,
we
obtain
a
natural
positive
homomorphism
of
monoids
ψ
:
P
→
Q
such
that,
for
i
=
1,
2,
φi
:
P
→
N
admits
a
factorization
P
→
Q
→
N
as
the
composite
of
ψ
with
some
positive
homomorphism
ψi
:
Q
→
N.
Here,
we
note
that
the
positivity
of
ψi
follows
immediately
from
the
positivity
of
φi
.
Also,
we
observe
that
the
positivity
of
ψi
implies
that
the
monoid
Q
has
no
nonzero
invertible
elements.
We
thus
conclude
that
Q
is
an
fs
monoid
of
rank
two,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii).
Assertion
(iv)
follows
immediately
from
assertion
(iii),
together
with
the
equivalence
(ii-a)
⇐⇒
(ii-c)
of
assertion
(ii).
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(v).
First,
we
consider
the
suﬃciency
portion
of
the
asserted
equivalence.
To
verify
this
suﬃciency,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
the
log

Z
log
[cf.
Proposition
1.4,
(vii)]
is
a
minimal
natural
monomorphism
hlog
z
:
z
point-hull
at
z.
The
fact
that
hlog
z
is
a
point-hull
at
z
follows
immediately
from
the
log
various
deﬁnitions
involved.
Now
suppose
that
hlog

z
log
is
a
monomor1

H1
log
log

such
that
the
composite

at
z
[so
both
z
◦
h1
:
H1

Z
log
log
z
and
H1
are
one-pointed].
Then
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that,
by
applying
Lemma
1.5,
(v),
as
in
the
proof
of
Proposition
1.6,
(i),
it
follows
from
Proposition
1.4,
(iii),
and
Lemma
2.7
that
hlog
is
scheme-like,
and
hence,
by
Proposition
1.4,
1
(v);
[LgSch],
Proposition
1.1,
(ii),
that
hlog
1
is
an
isomorphism,
as
desired.
Thus,
to
complete
the
proof
of
assertion
(v),
it
suﬃces
to
verify
the
necessity
portion
of
the
asserted
equivalence.
First,
let
us
observe
that
it
follows
from
the
existence
of
the
log

H
log
,
together
with
the
deﬁnition
of
the
notion
of
natural
monomorphism
Hred
a
minimal
point-hull,
that
H
log
is
reduced
and
one-pointed.
Thus,
it
follows
immediately
from
Proposition
1.6,
(i),
that
hlog
induces
a
monomorphism
H
log

z
log
.
Since
we
have
already
veriﬁed
that
hlog
z
is
a
minimal
point-hull
at
z,
we
thus
conlog

z
log
is
an
isomorphism,
as
desired.

Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
The
preservation
of
(i-a)
follows
immediately,
in
light
of
the
preservation
of
(i-d)
asserted
in
Theorem
2.6,
(i),
from
the
condition
(∗nod
),
together
with
the
deﬁnition
of

The
prservation
of
(i-b)
now
follows
from
the
preservation
of
(i-a),
together
with
the
bijection
of
Proposition
2.10,
(iv).
The
preservation
of
(i-c)
then
follows
from
the
preservation
of
(i-b)
[cf.
also
the
preservation
of
(i-a),
(i-d)
asserted
in
Theorem
2.6,
(i)],
together
with
the
equivalence
of
Proposition
2.10,
(i).
The
preservation
of
(i-d)
follows,
in
light
of
the
preservation
of
(i-c),
from
Propositions
2.8;
2.10,
(v);
2.11
[cf.
also
the
preservation
of
(i-d),
(i-j),
(i-l)
asserted
in
Theorem

(i)].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Now
assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
[i.e.,
in
the
spirit
of
Theorem
2.6,

[LgSch],
Corollary
2.15]
from
the
portion
of

(i)
concerning

note
that
the

leads

to

Proof.
First,
let
us
observe
that
the
inequality
dimsm
(Y
log
)
≤
1
of
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(i-a),
together
with
the
restriction
imposed
by
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(i-b)
[cf.
also
Propositions
1.4,
(iv);
1.6,
(i)],
imply
that
the
integers
“d”
and
“n”
in
Proposition
1.10
satisfy
the
following
conditions:
(∗1
)
n
∈
{1,
2};
(∗2
)
n
=
2
=⇒
d
=
0;
(∗3
)
n
=
1
=⇒
d
≤
1.
Assertion
(i)
thus
follows
from
(∗1
)
[cf.
also
Lemma
1.9].
Assertion
(ii)
follows
from
(∗1
),
(∗2
)
[cf.
also
Lemma
1.9].
Assertion
(iii)
follows
from
(∗1
),
(∗3
),
together
with
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(i-c)
[cf.
also
Proposition
2.2,
(i)].
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iv).
If
y
is
a
nodal
point
of
Y
log
,
then
write
y
log
for
the
log
scheme
obtained
by
restricting
the
log
structure
of
Y
log
to
the
closed
subscheme,
equipped
with
the
reduced
induced
scheme
structure,
of
Y
determined
def
by
y.
Write
Zylog
=
Z
log
×Y
log
y
log
.
Thus,
the
underlying
scheme
Zy
of
Zylog
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
scheme-theoretic
ﬁber
of
Z
over
y.
Note
that
if
Zy
=
∅
for
log
every
nodal
point
y
of
Y
log
,
then
f
log
admits
a

it

Thus,
since,
by
assertion
(iii),
Zred

it
follows
immediately
—
i.e.,
by
possibly
replacing
Z
log
by
the
log
scheme
determined
by
a
suitable
dense
open
subscheme
of
Z
—
that,
to
complete
the
proof
of
assertion
(iv),
it
suﬃces
to
verify,
under
the
additional
assumption
that
Zylog
is
connected
[hence
nonempty]
for
some
ﬁxed
nodal
point
y
of
Y
log
,
that
dim(Zy
)
=
1.
36
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
To
this
end,
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
the
natural
morphism
Zylog
→
y
log
is
SLEM.
Since
Zylog
is
connected
and
[by
assertion
(iii)]
of
rank
one,
it
follows
from
Lemma
1.5,
(v)
[where
we
take
“S
log
”
to
be
y
log
],
that
the
monomorphism
Zylog
→
y
log
admits
a
factorization
as
a
composite
of
monomorphisms
log

y
log
Zylog

yZ
log
—
where
yZ
is,
in
the
notation
of
Lemma
1.5,
(v),
a
log
scheme
of
rank
one
of
log
log
the
form
“S
[ξ]”;
yZ

y
log
is
the
composite
monomorphism
of
Lemma
1.5,
(vi)
log
[where
we
take
“S+
[ξ]

S
log
[ξ]”
to
be
the
identity
morphism].
Since
Zylog

log
is
SLEM
and
hence,
by
y
log
is
SLEM,
it
follows
immediately
that
Zylog

yZ
log
Proposition
2.2,
(ii),
an
open
immersion.
Since
the
underlying
scheme
of
yZ
is
of
dimension
one
[cf.
Lemma
1.5,
(iv),
(v)],
we
thus
conclude
that
dim(Zy
)
=
1,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iv).
def
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(v).
Write
k
for
the
residue
ﬁeld
of
Y
at
y,
S
log
=
log
Y
×Y
Spec(k)
[where
the
morphism
implicit
in
the
right-hand
factor
of
the
ﬁber
product
is
the
tautological
morphism
Spec(k)
→
Y
associated
to
y].
Thus,
S
log
is
a
log
scheme
of
the
sort
that
appears
in
Lemma
1.5,
so,
in
the
following
discussion,
we
shall
apply
the
notational
conventions
introduced
at
the
beginning
of
Lemma
1.5.
Write
OY
for
the
complete
noetherian
local
ring
obtained
by
completing
Y
def
def
along
y,
Y
=
Spec(OY
),
Y
log
=
Y
log
×Y
Y
,
y
for
the
unique
closed
point
of
Y
.
Write
OY
sep
for
the
completion
of
the
strict
henselization
of
OY
determined
def
by
k
sep
,
Y
sep
=
Spec(OY
sep
)
[so
Y
sep
is
equipped
with
a
natural
action
by
Gk
],
def
(Y
sep
)log
=
Y
log
×Y
Y
sep
,
y
sep
for
the
unique
closed
point
of
Y
sep
.
Next,
let
us
ﬁx
a
chart
P
→
OY
sep
of
(Y
sep
)log
that
determines
a
“clean
chart”
in
the
sense
of
[ExtFam],
Deﬁnition
1.3.
This
chart
thus
determines
a
natural
isomorphism
of
the
ﬁber
at
y
sep
of
the
monoid
MY
sep
that
deﬁnes
the
log
structure
of
(Y
sep
)log
with
the
product
P
×
OY×

sep
.
In
particular,
the
natural
action
of
Gk
on
this
ﬁber
determines
an
action
of
Gk
on
P
×OY×

sep
[i.e.,
which
is
compatible
with
the
×
factor
{0}
×
OY
sep
,
but
not
necessarily
compatible
with
the
factor
P

of
this

product
decomposition!],
hence
also
on
the
groupiﬁcation

of
P

.
log
log
log
Note
that
since
Y
is
a
log-Dedekind
object
of
Sch
(X
),
it
follows
immediately
from
assertion
(ii)
that
the
support
of
the
closed
subscheme
Y∗sep
⊆
Y
sep
determined
by
the
ideal
generated
by
the
image
via
the
chart
under
consideration
of
P
\
{0}
is
equal
to
{y
sep
}.
Next,
let
Q
⊆
P
gp
be
a
ﬁnitely
generated,
saturated
submonoid
such
that
P
⊆
Q
=
P
gp
.
Write
GQ
⊆
Gk
for
the
open
subgroup
of
elements
that
preserve
Q
[i.e.,
relative
to
∼

gp
deterthe
natural
action
of
Gk
on
the
quotient
(P

×
OY×

sep
)/OY

sep
→
P
mined,
as
discussed
above,
by
the
chart
under
consideration!].
Thus,
the
action
of
Gk
on
P
gp
×
OY×

sep
determines
an
action
of
GQ
⊆
Gk
on
the

.
Moreover,
we
assume
further
that
one
of
the
following
[mutually
exclusive!]
conditions
holds:
(v-a)
GQ
=
Gk
,
and,
moreover,
the
natural
inclusion
P
⊆
Q
is
a
sumdominating
homomorphism
of
fs
monoids
[cf.
the
discussion
entitled
“Generalities
on
monoids”
in
§0].
(v-b)
There
exists
a
positive
homomorphism
ξ
:
P
→
N
which
induces
a
surjection
on
groupiﬁcations
ξ
gp
:
P
gp

Z
such
that
Q
coincides
with
the
saturation
[cf.
[LgSch],
Lemma
2.5,
(ii)]
of
the
submonoid
of
P
gp
generated
by
P
and
Ker(ξ
gp
).
Thus,
even
when
GQ
=
Gk
[which
implies
that
condition
(v-b)
holds],
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
the
natural
inclusion
P
⊆
Q
is
a
sum-dominating
homomorphism.
That
is
to
say,
the
natural
inclusion
P
⊆
Q
is
a
sum-dominating
homomorphism,
no
matter
which
of
the
two
conditions
(v-a),
(v-b)
one
assumes.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
the
inclusion
P
→
Q
determines
a
log
étale
monomorphism
def
def
Z
log
[Q]
=
Spec(OY
sep
[Q])log
→
Z

[P

=
Spec(OY
sep
[P
])log
[cf.
the
construction
discussed
in
Proposition
1.4,
(ii),
as
well
as
[Kato1],
Proposition
3.4].
Thus,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
the
actions
[determined,
as
discussed
×
above,
by
the
chart
under
consideration!]
of
Gk
on
P
×OY×

sep
and
of
GQ
on
Q×OY

sep
determine,
respectively,
actions
of
Gk
on
Z
log
[P
]
and
GQ
on
Z
log
[Q].
Moreover,
the
chart
P
→
OY
sep
under
consideration
determines
a
tautological
Gk
-equivariant
morphism
(Y
sep
)log
→
Z
log
[P
]
and
hence
a
ﬁber
product
[of
fs
log
schemes]
def
(Z
sep
)log
=
(Y
sep
)log
×Z
log
[P
]
Z
log
[Q]
equipped
with
a
natural
action
by
GQ
.
This
natural
GQ
-action
in
turn
determines
descent
data
for
the
projection
morphism
(Z
sep
)log
→
(Y
sep
)log
,
which
may
be
used
to
descend
this
projection
morphism
to
a
log
étale
monomorphism
Z
log
→
YQlog
,
where
we
write
YQ
→
Y
for
the
ﬁnite
étale
covering
corresponding
to
the
open
def
subgroup
GQ
⊆
Gk
,
YQlog
=
Y
log
×Y
YQ
.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
since
Y
log
is
a
log-Dedekind
object
of
Schlog
(X
log
)
[or,
equivalently,
of
Schlog
(Y
log
)],
it
follows
immediately
from
assertions
(ii)
and
(iii)
that
any
minimal
object
of
Schlog
(Z
log
)
is
of
rank
one.
Thus,
since
the
inclusion
P
⊆
Q
is
sum-dominating,
it
follows
from
the
ﬁnal
portion
of
Lemma
1.9
that
any
regular
function
on
the
underlying
scheme
Z
sep
of
(Z
sep
)log
that
arises
[i.e.,
via
the
various
charts
implicit
in
the
above
discussion]
from
an
element
∈
P
\
{0}
necessarily
vanishes
at
every
point
of
Z
sep
,
hence
[since
Z
sep
is
noetherian]
is
necessarily
nilpotent.
Since,
as
observed
above,
the
support
of
the
closed
subscheme
Y∗sep
⊆
Y
sep
is
equal
to
{y
sep
},
we
thus
conclude
that
the
natural
morphism
Z
sep
→
Y
sep
factors
through
a
closed
subscheme
of
Y
sep
whose
support
is
equal
to
{y
sep
}.
This
in
turn
implies
that,
if
we
write
Z
for
the
underlying
scheme
of
Z
log
,
then
the
composite
morphism
Z
→
YQ
→
Y
factors
through
a
closed
subscheme
of
Y
whose
support
is
equal
to
{y}.
38
SHINICHI

Next,
I
claim
that
the
composite
morphism
Z
log
→
YQlog
→
Y
log
is
a
log
étale
monomorphism.
Indeed,
in
light
of
what
has
already
been
veriﬁed,
it
suﬃces
to
prove,
in
the
case
where
GQ
=
Gk
[which
implies
that
condition
(v-b)
holds],
that
this
composite
morphism
is
a
monomorphism.
Since
the
morphism
Z
log
→
YQlog
is
already
known
to
be
a
monomorphism,
and
the
morphism
YQlog
→
Y
log
is
a
scheme-like
morphism
whose
underlying
morphism
of
schemes
is
ﬁnite
étale,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
to
complete
the
proof
of
the
claim,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
[cf.
the
argument
applied
in
the
proof
of
Lemma
1.5,
(vi);
the
fact
that
the
composite
morphism
Z
→
YQ
→
Y
factors
through
a
closed
subscheme
of
Y
whose
support
is
equal
to
{y}]
that
the
base-change
of
the
morphism
Z
log
→
Y
log
via
the
natural
morphism
S
log
→
Y
log
is
a
monomorphism.
On
the
other
hand,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
this
base-changed
morphism
Z
log
×Y
log
S
log
→
S
log
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
morphism
“S
log
[ξ]
→
S
log
”
of
Lemma
1.5,
(vi)
[where
the
objects
“ξ”,
“H”
of
Lemma
1.5,
(vi),
correspond,
respectively,
to
ξ
and
GQ
in
the
present
discussion;
we
observe
that
it
follows
immediately
from
condition
(v-b)
that
“Ξ+
=
Ξ”].
Thus,
the
fact
that
this
base-changed
morphism
Z
log
×Y
log
S
log
→
S
log
is
a
monomorphism
follows
from
Lemma
1.5,
(vi).
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
claim.
Thus,
in
summary,
the
composite
morphism
Z
log
→
Y
log
→
Y
log
may
be
regarded
as
a
log
étale
monomorphism
of
Schlog
(Y
log
),
or,
indeed,
of
Schlog
(X
log
).
In
the
following,
we
shall
use
the
notation
f
log
:
Z
log
→
Y
log
to
denote
this
composite
morphism.
Moreover,
one
computes
easily
that,
if
we
write
Z
for
the
underlying
scheme
of
Z
log
,
then
Zred
×YQ
Y
sep
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
reduced
closed
subscheme
of
Spec(k
sep
[Q])
determined
by
forming
the
zero
locus
of
the
set
of
functions
P
\
{0}
⊆
Q.
Thus,
if
condition
(v-a)
holds,
then
one
veriﬁes
∼
immediately,
by
applying
an
isomorphism
Qpf
→
Q≥0
⊕
Q≥0
as
in
the
discussion
entitled
“Rank
two
fs
monoids”
in
§0
[cf.
also
Lemma
1.5,
(iv)],
that
Zred
×YQ
Y
sep
may
be
regarded
as
the
codomain
of
a
ﬁnite
surjective
morphism
whose
domain
consists
of
two
copies
of
the
aﬃne
line
over
k
sep
glued
together
at
a
single
point,
hence,
in
particular,
is
connected.
On
the
other
hand,
if
condition
(v-b)
holds,
then
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
Zred
×YQ
Y
sep
is
a
one-dimensional
torus
[cf.
the
situation
discussed
in
Lemma
1.5,
(iv)],
hence,
in
particular,
is
connected.
Thus,
in
summary,
the
morphism
f
log
:
Z
log
→
Y
log
is
a
log
étale
monomorphism
with
connected
domain
such
that
the
resulting
chain
Chn(f
log
)
⊆
SmCp(Y
log
)
is
contained
in
SmCp(Y
log
)y
.
Now
we
consider
the
monoids
constructed
in
Example
0.2,
where
we
allow
n
∈
N
to
vary.
Then
it
follows
immediately
from
the
discussion
of
Example
0.2
that
given
any
element
γ
∈
SmCp(Y
log
)y
,
it
holds
that
MONOMORPHISMS

def
γ
∈
Chn(f
log
),
if,
in
the
notation
of
Example
0.2,
we
take
Q
=
n
P
—
a
submonoid
which,
as
discussed
in
Example
0.2,
may
be
constructed
in
such
a
way
that
condition
(v-a)
holds
—
for
n
suﬃciently
large.
Finally,
let
H
log
→
Y
log
be
a
morphism
in
Schlog
(X
log
)
from
a
minimal
object
H
log
to
Y
log
that
maps
the
unique
point
of
the
underlying
scheme
H
of
H
log
to
y.
Thus,
if
we
regard
H
as
the
spectrum
of
a
ﬁnite
subextension
of
k
in
the
perfection
of
k
sep
,
then
the
morphism
H
log
→
Y
log
determines,
by
considering
the
induced
morphism
on
log
structures,
a
positive
homomorphism
ξ
:
P
→
N
and
submonoid
Q
⊆
P
gp
that
satisfy
condition
(v-b).
Moreover,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
construction
of
f
log
that
Z
log
is
submonic
[so
f
log
may
be
regarded
as
a
representative
of
an
element
of
SmCp(Y
log
)y
],
and
that
the
morphism
H
log
→
Y
log
factors
through
f
log
.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(v).
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(vi).
If
γ
is
non-nodal,
then
assertion
(vi)
follows
immediately
from
assertions
(iii)
and
(iv).
Thus,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
γ
is
nodal.
Then
assertion
(vi)
follows
immediately
by
gluing,
in
the
notation
of
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(ii),
the
various
Zilog

Y
log
that
constitute
an
element
log
of
SmCp(Y
log
)
along
the
open
immersions
Z12

Zilog
.
Here,
we
note
that
it
log
that
appeared
in
the
follows
immediately

Remark

In

Proposition
3.4.
(First
properties
of
partitions)
(i)
Suppose
that
Y
log
is
an
orientable
object
of
Schlog
(X
log
).
Let
{C1
,
C2
}
be
a
partition
at
an
element
γ
∈
SmCp(Y
log
).
Then,
up
to
a
possible
permutation
of
the
indices
“1”,
“2”,
every
partition
at
γ
coincides
with
{C1
,
C2
}.
(ii)
Suppose
that
Y
log
is
an
orientable
object
of
Schlog
(X
log
).
Let
{C1
,
C2
}
be
a
partition
at
a
non-nodal
element
γ
∈

);
hlog

Y

,

log
hlog

Y

as
in

Then,
for

=

:

Y

is

and

and
hlog
is
a

representative
for

i.e.,
in
the
sense

of
Proposition
3.2,
(vi).
In
particular
[cf.
Remark
3.3.1],
the
partition
{C1
,
C2
}
is
seamless.
(iii)
Suppose
that
Y

is
a
homogeneous
object
of
Schlog
(X

Then
Y
log
log
is
one-pointed,
and
Ysm
is

(iv)
Suppose
that
Y
log
is
a
log-nodal
object
of
Schlog
(X
log
).
Then
Y
log
is
homogeneous,
hence,
in
particular,
orientable.
Moreover,
relative
to
the
notational
conventions
introduced
in
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(i),
SmCp(Y
log
)
may
be
naturally
identiﬁed
with
the
set
of
positive
homomorphisms
ξ
:
PY
→

such
that
ξ
induces
a
surjection
on

Z.
(v)
Suppose
that
Y
log
is
a
reduced,
one-pointed,
non-split
object
of
rank
two
of
Schlog
(X
log
).
Then
Y
log
is
log-Dedekind,
but
not
orientable.
In
particular,
Y
log
is
not
homogeneous.
If,
moreover,
Y
=
Spec(kY
)
for
some
ﬁeld
kY
,
and
def
kZ
is
a

of

such
that

=
Y
log
×kY
kZ
is
log-nodal,

then
SmCp(Y
log
)
may
be
naturally
identiﬁed
with
the
set
of
Gal(kZ
/kY
)-orbits
of
the
set
SmCp(Z
log
)
[i.e.,
which
was
described
explicitly
in
(iv)].
Proof.
Assertion
(i)
follows,
by
applying
entirely
formal
set-theoretic
considerations,
from
Deﬁnition
3.3,
(i-a),
(i-b),
(i-c).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
If
one
restricts
the
morphisms
hlog
:
Yilog

Y
log
to
the
open
subscheme
Ysm
⊆
Y
[cf.
i
Proposition
3.2,
(ii)],
then
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
the
corresponding
“restrictions”
[in
the
evident
sense]
to
Ysm
of
the
properties
asserted
in
assertion
(ii)
follow
immediately
from
Proposition
3.2,
(vi).
Next,
let
y
be
a
nodal
point
of
Y
log
.
Then,
since
γ
is
non-nodal,
it
follows
immediately
from
Propositions
1.6,
(i);
3.2,
(iv),
(v);
Deﬁnition
3.3,
(i-a),
(i-c),
(i-d),
that
there
exists
a
j
∈
{1,
2}
such
that,
if
i
=
j
(respectively,
i
=
j),
then
SmCp(Y
log
)y
⊆
Ci
(respectively,
SmCp(Y
log
)y
∩
Ci
=
∅),
to
the
formal
scheme
obtained
by
completing
and,
moreover,
the
restriction
of
hlog
i
Y
along
y
is
an
isomorphism
(respectively,
has
empty
domain).
Thus,
it
follows
immediately
[cf.
Proposition
3.2,
(ii)]
that
there
exists
a
Zariski
open
neighborhood
log
to
U
is
scheme-like,
U
of
y
in
Y
such
that,
for
i
=
1,
2,
the
restriction
hlog
i
|U
of
hi
and,
moreover,
the
underlying
morphism
of
schemes
associated
to
hlog
i
|U
is
an
étale
monomorphism
[cf.
Proposition
1.4,
(v)],
hence,
by
elementary
scheme
theory,
an
open
immersion,
whose
image
contains
y
if
i
=
j.
The
seamlessness
of
the
partition
{C1
,
C2
}
thus
follows
from
elementary
scheme
theory
[i.e.,
an
easy
case
of
“Zariski
descent”].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
First,
let
us
observe
that
it
follows
formally
from
assertion
(ii)
that
every
submonic
component
of
a
homogeneous
object
of
Schlog
(X
log
)
is
necessarily
nodal.
It
thus
follows
formally
[cf.
Proposition
3.2,
log
is
empty
and
hence,
by
Proposition
3.2,
(ii),
that
Y
is
of
dimension
(vi)]
that
Ysm
zero.
Since
homogeneous
objects
of
Schlog
(X
log
)
are,
by
deﬁnition,
connected
[hence
nonempty],
we
thus
conclude
that
Y
log
is
one-pointed.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iv).
First,
let
us
observe
that
Y
log
satisﬁes
the
hypotheses
imposed
on
the
log
scheme
“S
log
”
of
Lemma
1.5.
Thus,
Lemma
1.5,
(iv),
(v),
which
we
apply
in
the
case
where,
in
the
notation
of
loc.
cit.,
“Q”
is
of
rank
one,
yields
a
log
étale
monomorphism
“S
log
[ξ]

S
log
”,
whose
domain
is
connected
and
submonic.
In
particular,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
existence
and
functorial
interpretation
[cf.
Lemma
1.5,
(iv),
(v)]
of
such
monomorphisms
“S
log
[ξ]

S
log
”
that
Y
log
is
log-Dedekind
[cf.
Propositions
1.4,
(vi);
2.2,
(ii)].
Next,
for
simplicity,
def
let
us
write
P
=
PY
.
Then
observe
that,
since
Y
log
is
split,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved
that
any
element
γ
∈
SmCp(Y
log
)
determines
—
i.e.,
by
considering
the
morphism
induced
on
log
structures
by
a
representative
of
γ
[cf.
Proposition
1.4,
(iii)]
—
a
positive
homomorphism
ξγ
:
P
→
N
such
that
ξγ
induces
a
surjection
on
groupiﬁcations
ξγgp
:
P
gp

Z.
Moreover,
it
follows
immediately
from
Proposition
3.2,
(vi),
together
with
the
various
properties
of
the
monomorphisms
“S
log
[ξ]

S
log
”
discussed
in
Lemma
1.5,
(v),
that
the
assignment
γ
→
ξγ
just
discussed
determines
a
natural
bijection
between
SmCp(Y
log
)
and
the
set
of
positive
homomorphisms
ξ
:
P
→
N
such
that
ξ
induces
a
surjection
on
groupiﬁcations
ξ
gp
:
P
gp

Z.
In
the
following,
we
shall
apply
this
natural
bijection
to
identify
these
two
sets.

Next,
let
γ
∈
SmCp(Y
log
).
Write
φ0
:
P
→
J0
=
N
for
the
element
ξγ
discussed
above.
In
the
notation
of
the
discussion
entitled
“Rank
two
fs
monoids”
in
§0,
for
i
=
1,
2,
let
us
write
φi
:
P

Ji
for
the
associated
positive
homomorphism
of
fs
monoids
[which
is
well-deﬁned,
up
to
possible

of
the

“1”
and
“2”]
and
Ci
⊆
SmCp(Y

for
the
subset
of
elements
δ
∈
SmCp(Y
log
)
such
that
ξδ
:
P
→
N
factors
through
either
φ0
or
φi
.
Then
I
claim
that
{C1
,
C2
}
is
a
partition
at
γ
which
is
not
seamless.
Indeed,
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
condition
(i-a)
of
Deﬁnition
3.3
follows
immediately
from
the
discussion
of
bisecting
monoids
in
§0.
Next,
let
us
observe
that,
if
we
take
the
log
scheme
“S
log
”
in
Lemma
1.5
to
be
Y
log
,
then
it
follows,
by
applying
Lemma
1.5,
(vii),
(viii),
to
φ0
,
that,
for
i
=
1,
2,
the
log
étale
monomorphism
“S
log
[φ{0,i}
]

S
log
”
yields
an
object
hlog
:
Yilog

Y
log
as
in
condition
(i-d)
i
of
Deﬁnition
3.3.
Next,
we
verify
condition
(i-c)
of
Deﬁnition
3.3.
To
this
end,
suppose
that
C
⊆
SmCp(Y
log
)
\
{γ}
is
a
chain
that
intersects
both
C1
\
{γ}
and
C2
\
{γ}.
Then
it
follows
immediately
from
the
connectedness
assumption
in
the
deﬁnition
of
a
chain
[cf.
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(iii)],
together
with
Proposition
1.4,
(iii);
Lemma
1.9,
that
there
exists
a
rank
two
fs
monoid
P
∗
that
arises
as
a
submonoid
of
P
gp
that
contains
P
and,
moreover,
for
i
=
1,
2,
admits
a
homomorphism
ψi
:
P
∗
→
N
whose
restriction
to
P
determines
an
element
of
Ci
\
{γ}.
Moreover,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
description
given
above
of
SmCp(Y
log
)
[i.e.,
by
considering
suitable
minimal
points
—
cf.
also
Proposition
2.2,
(ii)]
that
P
∗
may
be
chosen
so
that
any
positive
homomorphism
P
∗
→
N
that
induces
a
surjection
on
groupiﬁcations
determines
an
element
of
C.
On
the
other
hand,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
“continuity
property”
of
bisecting
monoids
discussed
in
§0
that
φ0
extends
to
a
positive
homomorphism
P
∗
→
N
and
hence
that
γ
∈
C,
a
contradiction.
This
completes
the
veriﬁcation
of
condition
(i-c)
of
Deﬁnition
3.3.
Next,
we
observe
that
condition
(i-b)
of
Deﬁnition
3.3
—
i.e.,
the
fact
that,
for
i
=
1,
2,
Ci
\
{γ}
is
an
N-chain
—
follows
immediately
by
considering
the
log
étale
monomorphisms
“S
log
[φ{0,i}
]

S
log
”
that
arise
by
applying
Lemma
1.5,
(vii),
(viii)
[for
an
appropriate
choice
of
the
indices
“1”
and
“2”],
to
a
sequence
of
bisecting
monoids
as
in
Example
0.1,
where
we
take
“P
⊆
∞
P
”
to
be
the
inclusion
of
monoids
P
⊆
Ji
that
appears
in
the
present
discussion.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
fact
that
{C1
,
C2
}
is
a
partition
at
γ.
The
fact
that
this
partition
is
not
seamless
follows
immediately
from
the
existence
of
the
log
étale
monomorphism
“S
log
[φ{0,1,2}
]

S
log
”
that
arises
by
applying
Lemma
1.5,
(vii),
(viii),
to
φ0
.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
claim.
Now
it
follows
formally
that
Y
log
is
homogeneous.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iv).
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(v).
First,
we
observe
that
the
fact
that
Y
log
is
log-Dedekind
follows
immediately
from
assertion
(iv),
via
a
routine
étale
descent
argument;
the
description
given
in
the
statement
of
assertion
(v)
of
the
set
SmCp(Y
log
)
also
follows
immediately,
in
light
of
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved,
via
a
routine
étale
descent
argument
[cf.
also
Proposition
3.2,
(vi)].
Now
let
δ
∈
SmCp(Y
log
)
be
an
element
that
arises
from
a
Gal(kZ
/kY
)-invariant
element
γ
∈
SmCp(Z
log
).
Here,
we
note
that
the
existence
of
such
an
element
of
SmCp(Z
log
)
follows
immediately
from
the
description
of
SmCp(Z
log
)
given
in
assertion
(iv),
together
with
Lemma
1.5,
(ii),
which
implies
the
existence
of
a
suitable
def
positive
homomorphism
ξγ
:
P
=
PZ
→
N.
Then
to
complete
the
proof
that
Y
log
MONOMORPHISMS

is
not
orientable,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
Y

does
not
admit
a
partition
at
δ.
Moreover,
to
verify
that
Y
log
does
not
admit
a
partition
at
δ,
it
suﬃces,
in
light
of
conditions
(i-b),
(i-c)
of
Deﬁnition
3.3,
to
show
that
SmCp(Y
log
)\{δ}
is
an
N-chain.
To
this
end,
we
consider
the
sequence
of
bisecting
monoids
{n
P
}n∈N
of
Example
0.1,
where
we
take
“P
⊆
∞
P
”
to
be
one
of
the
two
bisecting
monoids
of
P
at
ξγ
.
Thus,
the
homomorphism
“∞
φ”
of
Example
0.1
corresponds
to
ξγ
in
the
present
discussion.
Now
let
us
consider
the

“S

that
arise
by
applying
Lemma
1.5,
(vii),
(viii),
(ix),
where
we
take
the
log
scheme
“S
log
”
of
loc.
cit.
to
be
Y
log
,
and
we
take
“φ1
:
P
→
J1
”
to
be
the
inclusion
P
⊆
n
P
,
for
n
∈
N.
Here,
we
observe
that
if
ζ
:
P
→
N
and
σ
are
as
in
the
condition
of
the
display
of
Lemma
1.5,
(ix),
and
σ
acts
nontrivially
on
P
,
then
it
follows
immediately
from
the
Gal(kZ
/kY
)-invariance
of
ξγ
[i.e.,
“∞
φ”]
that
σ
acts
nontrivially
on
Ker(ξγgp
)
(∼
=
Z),
and
hence
[since
both
ζ
and
ζ
◦
σ
are
assumed
to
factor
through
J1
and
hence
through
“∞
P
”]
that
ζ
gp
vanishes
on
Ker(ξγgp
);
but
this
implies
that
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
ζ
=
ξγ
,
which
in
turn
implies
[cf.
Example
0.1]
that
ζ
gp
(J1
)
=
ξγgp
(J1
)
⊆
Z
contains
both
positive
and
negative
elements,
in
contradiction
to
the
assumptions
imposed
on
ζ.
That
is
to
say,
the
condition
of
the
display
of
Lemma
1.5,
(ix),
is
satisﬁed.
Thus,
in
summary,
we
obtain
a
collection
{Znlog

Y
log
}n∈N
of
log
étale
monomorphisms
with
connected
domains
[cf.
Lemma
1.5,

such
that

and,
moreover,
∪n∈N
Chn(Znlog

=

\
{δ}.
This
completes
the
proof
of

that

is
an
N-chain

hence
of

Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
Since,
by
Proposition
3.4,
(iii),
homogeneous
objects
are
one-pointed,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
from
the
suﬃcency
portion
of
Proposition
2.10,
(iii),
that
the
condition
under
consideration
implies
that
PtCl(Y
log
)
is
of
cardinality
one,
and
hence,
by
Proposition
2.10,
(i),
(iv),
that
Y
log
is
one-pointed,
as
desired.
Now
suppose
that
Y
log
is
one-pointed.
Then,
by
Proposition
2.10,
(i),
(iv),
it
follows
that
PtCl(Y
log
)
is
of
cardinality
one.
Since,
by
Proposition
3.4,
(iv),
log-nodal
objects
are
homogeneous,
we
thus
conclude
from
the
deﬁnition
of
the
notion
of
“point-equivalence”
that
the
condition
under
consideration
is
satisﬁed.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
The
necessity
portion
of
assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
Propositions
2.10,
(v);
3.4,
(iv).
The
suﬃciency

“homogeneous”,
from
Propositions

asserted

immediately,
in

of
the
preservation
of

from
the

asserted
in

The

from

The

The

The


It
remains
to
reconstruct,
in
a
category-theoretic
fashion,
the
log
structures
of
the
various
log
schemes
under
consideration.
The
approach
taken
in
the
present
paper
is
essentially
similar
to
the
approach
taken
in
[LgSch],
but
is
formulated
in
a
slightly
diﬀerent
way.
We
begin
by
introducing
notation
as
in
the
discussion
preceding
[LgSch],
Lemma
2.16:
Write
A1Z
=
Spec(Z[t])
[where
t
is
an
indeterminate]
1
for
the
aﬃne
line
over
Z;
Alog
Z
for
the
aﬃne
line
AZ
over
Z
equipped
with
the
log
structure
determined
by
the
divisor
V
(t)
[i.e.,
“the
origin”];
expA
:
Alog
Z
→
AZ
for
the
natural
morphism
determined
by
“forgetting
the
log
structure”;
→
AY
log
expY
log
:
Alog
Y
log
for
the
“exponentiation
morphism”
obtained
by
base-changing
expA
via
the
natural
morphism
Y
log
→
Spec(Z);
A×
→
AY
log
Y
log
for
the
open
immersion
determined
by
the
complement
of
the
origin
of
AY
log
;
A×
Y,
×
AY
for
the
underlying
schemes
of
AY
log
,
AY
log
;
0Y
:
Y
→
AY
,
1Y
:
Y
→
AY
for
the
sections
determined
by
the
assignments
t
→
0,
t
→
1.
Thus,
the
map
induced
by
expY
log
on
Y
log
-valued
points
may
be
naturally
identiﬁed
with
expY
:
MY
→
OY
.
Moreover,
one
veriﬁes
easily
that
the
morphism
AZ
×Z
AZ
→
AZ
that
deﬁnes
the
multiplication
operation
on
the
ring
scheme
AZ
→
Spec(Z)
determines
a
morphism
of
log

over

that
induces,
i.e.,
on
Y
log
-valued
points,
the
monoid
operation
on
MY
.
In
the
following,
we
shall
always
regard
AY
log
as
being
equipped
with
the
“ring
log
scheme”
structure
—
i.e.,
the
ring
object
structure
in
the
category
of
log
schemes
—
determined
by
the
ring
scheme
structure
of
AZ
→
Spec(Z).
One
veriﬁes
immediately
that
any
automorphism
of
the
log
scheme
AY
log
that
lies
over
the
identity
automorphism
of
Y
log
and
is
compatible
with
the
ring
log
scheme
structure
of
AY
log
is
necessarily
equal
to
the
identity
automorphism.
Finally,
if
Y
log
is
an
object
of
Schlog
(X
log
),
then
we
observe
that
expY
log
:
Alog
→
AY
log
may
be
Y
log
log
regarded,
in
a
natural
way,
as
an

be
simpliﬁed
considerably:

the

that

write
Schlog

Let
∼
Φ
:
Schlog
(X1log

be
an

equivalence
of
categories.
Then:
(i)
Φ
preserves
the
following
constructions
[i.e.,
up
to,
in
the
case
of
(i-a),
(i-c),
a
unique
isomorphism]
associated
to
an
object
“(−)”:
(i-a)
the
ring
object
A(−)
;
(i-b)
the
full
subcategory
QExp(

⊆
Schlog
(A(−)

(i-c)
the
exponentiation

exp(−)
:
Alog

→
A(−)
;
(i-d)
the
monoid

structure
on
the

For

let
Yilog
be
an
object

write
Yi
for
the
underlying
scheme
of
Yilog
.
Suppose
further
that
Φ(Y1log

=
Y2log
.
Then
Φ
induces
an
isomorphism
of
log
schemes
∼
Y1log

48

that
is
functorial
[in
the
evident
sense!]
with
respect
to
Y1log
,
Y2log
and
compatible
with
the
isomorphism
of
schemes
of
Theorem
3.6,
(ii).
(iii)
There
exists
a
unique
isomorphism
of
log

∼
X1log

such
that
Φ
is
isomorphic
to
the
equivalence
of
categories
induced
by
this
isomor∼
phism
of
log
schemes
X1log
→
X2log
.
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
The
preservation
of
(i-a)
follows
immediately
from
Theorem
3.6,
(ii);
[LgSch],
Proposition
1.6,
(iii).
To
verify
the
preservation
of
(i-b),
it
suﬃces
to
verify
the
preservation
of
the
conditions
(a),
(b),
(c),
(d),
(e)
in
the
statement
of
Proposition
3.7.
The
preservation
of
condition
(a)
follows
immediately,
in
light
of
the
functorial
deﬁnition
of
log
smoothness
[i.e.,
in
terms
of
scheme-like
closed
immersions,
as
in
[Kato2],
§8.1,
(i)],
from
Theorem
3.6,
(ii).
The
preservation
of
condition
(b)
follows
formally
from
Theorem
3.6,
(ii).
The
preservation
of
conditions
(c)
and
(e)
follows
immediately
from
the
preservation
of
(i-a)
[i.e.,
which
has
already
been
veriﬁed],
together
with
Theorem
3.6,
(ii).
The
preservation
of
condition
(d)
follows
immediately
from
the
preservation
of
(i-c)
[cf.
also
Proposition
2.10,
(v)],
(i-d)
asserted
in
Corollary
2.12,
(i)
[which
is
applicable
in
light
of
the
preservation
of
(i-j)
asserted
in
Theorem
3.6,
(i)],
together
with
the
preservation
of
(i-b),
(i-d),
(i-g)
asserted
in
Theorem
2.6,
(i).
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
preservation
of
(i-b).
The
preservation
of
(i-c)
and
(i-d)
follows
formally
from
Proposition
3.7,
together
with
the
preservation
of
(i-b).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Since
the
map
induced
by
the
exponentiation
morphism
exp(−)
on
(−)-valued
points
may
be
naturally
identiﬁed
with
the
morphism
between
sheaves
of
monoids
that
deﬁnes
the
log
structure
of
“(−)”
[cf.
the
discussion
preceding
Proposition
3.7],
assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
assertion
(i);
Theorem
3.6,
(ii).
Finally,
assertion
(iii)
follows
immediately
from
the
existence
of
the
functorial
isomorphisms
of
log
schemes
discussed
in
assertion
(ii),
by
considering,
for
i
=
1,
2,
a
suitable
indobject
of
Schlog
(Xilog
)
{αi
Yilog
}αi
∈Ai
—
where
the
transition
morphisms
[notation
for
which
was
omitted
for
the
sake
of
simplicity!]
are
assumed
to
be
open
immersions
—
that
“represents
Xilog
”
in
Schlog
(Xilog
).
[Here,
we
recall
that
if
Xilog
fails
to
be
quasi-compact,
then
Xilog
does
not
determine
an
object
of
Schlog
(Xilog
)
in
the
usual
sense.]

In

relatively
minor
modiﬁcations

the

developed
in

for

that
are
necessary
in
order
to

as
discussed

At

we
observe
that

on
the
portions
of
the
theory
of
[LgSch]
that
[cf.
Example
0.3;
Remark
1.4.1]
are
in
error.
Thus,
in
the
present
§4,
we
explain
how
these
results,
as
well
as
the
main
theorem
of
[ArLgSch]
[i.e.,
[ArLgSch],
Theorem
5.1],
may
be
repaired
by
applying
the
theory
developed
thus
far
in
the
present
paper.
We
begin
by
reviewing
[and
slightly
modifying]
the
notation
introduced
at
the
beginning
of
[ArLgSch],
§4.
Write
SCH
for
the
category
of
arithmetic
schemes,
log
SCH
for
the
category
of
arithmetic
log
schemes
[cf.
[ArLgSch],
Deﬁnition
4.2,
and
the
following
discussion],
and
SCH
⊆
SCH;
log
SCHlog
⊆
SCH
for
the
full
subcategories
determined
by
the
purely
nonarchimedean
objects
[cf.
log
log
log
[ArLgSch],
Deﬁnition
4.3,
(i)].
Let
X
be
an
object
of
SCH
.
Thus,
X
determines
underlying
objects
X
log
,
X,
and
X
of
the
categories
SCHlog
,
SCH,
and
SCH,
respectively.
Write
SCH
log
(X
log
log
def
)
=
(SCH
)X
log
;
def
SCH(X)
=
SCHX
;
def
SCHlog
(X
log
)
=
(SCHlog
)X
log
;
def
SCH(X)
=
SCHX
for
the
respective
categories
of
“objects
over
the
subscripted
objects”
[cf.
the
notational
conventions
introduced
in
the
discussion
entitled
“Categories”
in
[ArLgSch],
§2]
and
Sch
log
(X
log
log
)
⊆
SCH
(X

);
Sch(X)
⊆
SCH(X);
Schlog
(X

)
⊆
SCHlog
(X
log
);
Sch(X)
⊆
SCH(X)
for
the
full
subcategories
determined
by
the
noetherian
objects.
To
simplify
the
exposition,
we
shall
often
refer
to
the
domain
of
an
arrow
which
is
an
object
of
any
of
the
categories
of
the
preceding
display
as
an
“object”
of
the
category.
Note
that
the
notation
just
introduced
is
consistent
with
the
notational
conventions
introduced
at
the
beginning
of
§1
of
the
present
paper
for
“Schlog
(X
log
)”
and
“Sch(X)”.
Indeed,
if
X
log
is
any
locally
noetherian
fs
log
scheme,
then
one
may
deﬁne
[in
a
fashion
consistent
with
the
notation
introduced
above!]
SCHlog
(X
log
)
to
be
the
category
whose
objects
are
morphisms
of
log
schemes
of
locally
ﬁnite
type
Y
log
→
X
log
,
where
Y
log
is
a
locally
noetherian
fs
log
scheme,
and
whose

[from

log
]
are
morphisms
of
locally
ﬁnite

Y1log
→

lying
over
X
log
.
In
a
similar
vein,
if

is
any

then
one
may
deﬁne
[in
a

(i)
We
shall
apply

whenever
this
terminology
may
be
deﬁned
in
an
evidently
analogous
fashion
for
the
category
of
the
above
display
under
consideration.
When
it
is
necessary,
in
order
to
avoid
confusion,
to
specify
the
category
of
the
above

with

to
which
the

we

append

Sch-,

the

will
be
applied,
in

is
to

understood
as
being
applied
to

(Equivalences

Let

For

be
an
arithmetic
scheme
[cf.

Proof.
If
C
=
Sch,
then
set
C
=
Sch;
if
C
=

then
set
C
=

Then
Theorem
4.3
follows,
in
eﬀect,
by
combining
the
theory
of
[LgSch],
§1,
with
the
non-logarithmic
portion
of
the
theory
developed
in
[ArLgSch],
§4,
§5.
[That
is
to
say,
the
errors
in
[ArLgSch]
discussed
at
the
beginning
of
the
present
§4
concern
subtleties
that
arise
from
the
log
structures
of
the
log
schemes
involved
and
hence
have
no
eﬀect
on
the
non-logarithmic
portion
of
the
theory.]
Indeed,
let
i
∈
{1,
2};
write
Xi
for
the
underlying
scheme
of
X
i
.
Then
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
the
C-minimal
objects
of
C(X
i
)
are
the
purely
nonarchimedean
objects
that
arise
from
the
C-minimal
objects
of
C(Xi
).
Thus,
the
one-pointed
objects
of
C(X
i
)
are
precisely
the
objects
Y
such
that
MinPt(Y
)
=
MinPt(Y
)
[where
we
write
Y
for
the
object
of
C(Xi
)
determined
by
the
underlying
scheme
of
Y
]
is
of
cardinality
one.
This
characterization
of
one-pointed
objects
of
C(X
i
)
allows
one
to
circumvent
the
application
of
[ArLgSch],
Proposition
4.3,
in
the
theory
of
[ArLgSch],
§4.
In
particular,
we
obtain
a
category-theoretic
characterization
of
C-minimal
pointhulls
as
in
[ArLgSch],
Proposition
4.4,
(iii).
One
thus
obtains
—
i.e.,
by
considering
epimorphisms
as
in
[ArLgSch],
Proposition
4.5
—
a
category-theoretic
characterization
of
the
purely
nonarchimedean
one-pointed
objects
of
C(X
i
)
as
in
[ArLgSch],
Corollary
4.1,
(i),
and
of
the

morphisms
[cf.

of
C(X
i
)
as
in
[ArLgSch],
Corollary
4.1,
(ii).
In
particular,
we
obtain
a
category-theoretic
characterization,
as
in
[ArLgSch],
Corollary
4.2,
of
the
purely
nonarchimedean
objects
of
C(X

and
hence,
by

Theorem
4.2,
a
category-theoretic
reconstruction
of
the
underlying
scheme

Now,
to
complete
the
proof
of
Theorem
4.3
[cf.

Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
The
preservation
of
(i-a),
(i-b),
(i-c),
(i-d),
(i-e),
(i-f),
and
(i-g)
follows
from
an
entirely
similar
argument
to
the
argument
applied
in
the
proof
of
the
preservation
of
the
corresponding
properties
in
Theorem
2.6,
(i).
Here,
we
observe
that
one
veriﬁes
immediately,
by
arguing
as
in
[ArLgSch],
Proposition
4.2,
that
log
log
the
minimal
objects
of
C
(X
i
)
are
precisely
the
purely
nonarchimedean
log
log
objects
of
C
(X

)
that
arise
from
the
minimal
objects
of
C
log
(Xilog
),
log
where
we
write
Xilog
for
the
underlying
log
scheme
of
X
i
.
The
preservation
of
(i-fnon
)
now
follows,
in
light
of
the
preservation
of
(i-f),
from
an
entirely
similar
argument
—
i.e.,
by
considering
epimorphisms
as
in
[ArLgSch],
Proposition
4.5
—
to
the
argument
applied
to
verify
the
category-theoretic
characterization
of
purely
nonarchimedean
one-pointed
objects
given
in
[ArLgSch],
Corollary
4.1,
(i).
In
light
of
the
preservation
of
(i-fnon
),
the
preservation
of
(i-h)
follows
from
an
entirely
similar
argument
to
the
argument
applied
in
the
proof
of
the
preservation
of
(i-h)
in
Theorem
2.6,
(i).
In
light
of
the
preservation
of
(i-h),
the
preservation
of
(i-i)
follows
from
an
entirely
similar
argument
to
the
argument
applied
in
the
proof
of
the
preservation
of
(i-i)
in
Theorem
2.6,
(i).
The
preservation
of
(i-inon
)
now
follows
from
the
preservation
of
(i-f),
(i-fnon
),
(i-i),
since
[one

the

may
be
characterized
as
the

In
light
of
the
preservation
of

the

of

follows
from
an

to
the
argument
applied
in
the
proof
of
the
preservation
of

(i-k)
in
Theorem

This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i),
except
for
the
veriﬁcation
of
the
preservation
of
(i-l).

Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
Suppose
that

is

for

log

log
log
log
Let
Z
i

i
be
a
purely
archimedean
morphism
of
C
(X
i
)
such
that
Z
i
is
purely
nonarchimedean
submonic.
Here,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
such
a
log
log
log
morphism
Z
i
→
Y
i
exists,
and,
moreover,
that
Z
i
may
be
characterized
up
to
log
log

isomorphism
as
an
object
over
Y
i
by
the
property
that
any

T
is
purely
nonarchimedean
submonic
admits
a
unique
log
log
log
factorization
T
→
Z
i
→
Y

.
Thus,
it
follows
from
the
portion
of
assertion
(i)
concerning
the
preservation
of
(i-inon
)
that
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
log
log
log
that
Φ(Z

)
=
Z
2
.
Moreover,
since
Z
i
is
purely
nonarchimedean,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved
that
the
full

→

[cf.
the

of

Corollary
4.3].
Thus,
by
applying
the
portion
of
assertion
(i)
concerning
the
preservation
of
(i-k),
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
follows
from
an
entirely
similar
argument
to
the
argument
applied
to

Theorem

Finally,
the
portion
of
assertion
(i)
concerning
the
preservation
of
(i-l)
follows
from
an
entirely
similar
argument
to
the

of

(Reconstruction

Proof.
In

Now

Finally,
it

Remark
4.7.1.
Let
Y
be
as
in
Deﬁnition
4.7,
i.e.,
a
connected,
non-submonic,
log
log
C
log
-log-Dedekind,
submonically
nonarchimedean
object
of
C
(X
).
Write
Y
log
log
for
the
underlying
log
scheme
of
Y
;
Y
for
the
underlying
arithmetic
scheme
of
log
Y
;
Y
for
the
underlying
scheme
of
Y
;
K
log
for
the
compact
set
that
determines
log
the
archimedean
structure
of
Y
[i.e.,
the
set
“H”
of
[ArLgSch],
Deﬁnition
4.2,
(ii)];
K
for
the
compact
set
that
determines
the
archimedean
structure
of
Y
[i.e.,
the
set
“H”
of
[ArLgSch],
Deﬁnition
4.2,
(i)].
Thus,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved
that
we
have
a
natural
surjection
K
log

K
whose
ﬁbers
are
compact
[cf.
the
discussion
of
such
compact
subsets
in
the
proof
of
[ArLlog
gSch],
Lemma
4.1]
.
Now
observe
that
the
assumption
that
Y
is
submonically
nonarchimedean
implies
[cf.
Proposition
3.2,
(i),
(ii)]
that
K
is
a
ﬁnite
compact
set
which
is
supported
over
the
nodal
points
of
Y
log
.
Since
the
ﬁniteness
of
K
implies
that
any
[e.g.,
open!]
subset
of
K
is
compact
[i.e.,
relative
to
the
topology
induced
by
K],
we
thus
conclude
that
any
subset
of
K
log
that
arises
as
the
inverse
image
via
the
natural
surjection
K
log

K
of
a
subset
of
K
is
compact
[i.e.,
relative
to
the
topology
induced
by
K
log
].
In
particular,
it
follows
that
any
open
subscheme
Z
⊆
Y
determines,
in
a
natural
def
way,
not
only
a
log
scheme
Z
log
=
Y
log
×Y
Z,
but
also
an
arithmetic
scheme
Z
and
log
an
arithmetic
log
scheme
Z
[i.e.,
by
considering
the
subsets
of
K,
K
log
consisting
of
points
that
map
to
points
of
Z
(⊆
Y
)].
Moreover,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
log
Z
(respectively,
Z)
represents
the
covariant
subfunctor
of
the
functor
log
(respectively,
Y
)
on
the

Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
Properties
(i-aY
),
(i-aZ
),
(i-bY
),
(i-bZ
),
(i-cZ
),
and
(i-dZ
)
follow
formally
from
the
deﬁnitions
[cf.
also
the
ﬁrst
display
in
the
proof
of
Theorem
4.5].
Property
(i-dY
)
then
follows,
in
light
of
properties
(iaY
)
and
(i-bY
)
[cf.
also
the
ﬁrst
display
in
the
proof
of
Theorem
4.5],
by
applying
a
similar
argument
to
the
argument
[i.e.,
involving
Proposition
3.4,
(ii)]
applied
in
the
proof
of
Proposition
3.4,
(iii).
Here,
we
note
that
one
must
apply
the
assumption
[cf.
the
beginning
of
Deﬁnition
4.7]
that
any
C¨log
-homogeneous
object
is
submonically
nonarchimedean
in
order
to
conclude
that
any
C¨log
-partition
that
determines
a
C
log
-seamless
C
log
-partition
as
in
[the
evident
analogue
for
C
log
of]
Proposition
3.4,
(ii),
is
necessarily
C¨log
-seamless.
That
is
to
say,
this
assumption
that
any
C¨log
-homogeneous
object
is
submonically
nonarchimedean
implies
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
4.7.1]
that
the
discrepancy
between
C¨log
-/C
log
-seamless
C¨log
/C
log
-partitions
may
—
at
least
in
the
case
of
C
log
-seamless
C
log
-partitions
as
in
[the
evident
analogue
for
C
log
of]
Proposition
3.4,
(ii)
—
be
ignored.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Next,
we
observe
that,
in
light
of
Theorem
4.5,
(i),
(ii),
assertion
(ii)
follows
by
applying
a
similar
argument
to
the
argument
applied
to
verify
Theorem
3.6,
(i).
Here,
we
observe
that
the
preservation
of
the
crucial
property
of
being
submonically
nonarchimedean
[cf.
the
beginning
of
Deﬁnition
4.7]
follows
formally
from
the
portion
of
Theorem
4.5,
(i),
concerning
the
preservation
of
(i-f),
(i-fnon
).
Also,
we
observe,
with
regard
to
the
preservation
of
(ii-g),
that,
by
applying
·
the
property
(i-dY
)
of
assertion
(i)
in
place
of
Proposition
3.4,
(iii),
and
·
the
property
(i-dZ
)
of
assertion
(i),
together
with
the
evident
analogue
for
C
log
of
Proposition
3.4,
(iv),
in
place
of
Proposition
3.4,
(iv),
log
—
i.e.,
by
considering
C¨log
-homogeneous
one
obtains
a
suitable
analogue
for
C
objects
—
of
the
characterization
of
one-pointed
objects
given
in
Proposition
3.5,
(i).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
First,
let
us
observe
that
the
portion
of
assertion
(ii)
concerning
the
preservation
of
(ii-g),
(ii-i)
allows
one
to
circumvent
the
application
of
[ArLgSch],
Propositions
4.3,
4.4,
in
the
theory
of
[ArLgSch],
§4.
One
thus
obtains
—
i.e.,
by
considering
epimorphisms
as
in
[ArLgSch],
Proposition
4.5
—
category-theoretic
characterizations
of
the
purely
nonarchimedean
one-pointed
oblog
log
jects
of
C
(X
i
)
as
in
[ArLgSch],
Corollary
4.1,
(i),
and
of
the
purely
archimedean
log
log
morphisms
of
C
(X
i
)
as
in
[ArLgSch],
Corollary
4.1,
(ii)
[cf.
also
Proposition
1.4,
(iii),
(v),
of
the
present
paper].
In
particular,
we
obtain
a
category-theoretic
characterization,
as
in
[ArLgSch],
Corollary
4.2,
of
the
purely
nonarchimedean
objects
of
log
log
C
(X
i
)
and
hence,
by
applying
Theorems
3.8,
(iii);
4.6,
(iv),
a
category-theoretic
log
log
reconstruction
of
the
underlying
log
scheme
of
an
object
of
C
(X
i
),
as
in
[ArLgSch],
Corollary
4.3.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii).
Finally,
assertion
60
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
(iv)
follows
from
assertion
(iii)
[cf.
the
proof
of
[ArLgSch],
Theorem
5.1],
by
applying
the
“logarithmic
global
compatibility”
established
in
[ArLgSch],
Lemma
5.2.

Appendix
In
the
present
Appendix,
we
discuss
in
more
detail,
at
the
level
of
individual
propositions,
lemmas,
corollaries,
theorems,
and
examples,
the
validity
of
the
theory
developed
in
[LgSch]
and
[ArLgSch].
First,
we
recall
that
the
errors
discussed
in
the
Introduction
of
the
present
paper
have
no
eﬀect
on
[LgSch],
§1.
The
eﬀect
of
these
errors
on
the
validity
of
the
statements
[second
column],
as
well
as
on
the
validity
of
the
proofs
[third
column],
of
the
individual
propositions,
lemmas,
corollaries,
and
theorems
of
[LgSch],
§2,
is
summarized
in
Fig.
1
below.
Here,
the
symbol
“”
indicates
no
eﬀect
on
the
validity
in
question;
the
symbol
“×”
indicates
some
eﬀect
on
the
validity
in
question.
Certain
results
that
concern
equivalences
are
divided
into
suﬃciency
and
necessity
portions.
Moreover,
the
necessity
portion
of
[LgSch],
Proposition
2.3,
is
divided
into
·
a
portion
concerning
whether
or
not
the
underlying
morphism
of
schemes
is
a
monomorphism
in
the
case
where
the
given
morphism
of
log
schemes
is
scheme-like,
·
a
portion
concerning
whether
or
not
the
induced
morphism
of
groupiﬁcations
of
characteristics
is
surjective,
and
·
a
portion
concerning
whether
or
not
the
underlying
morphism
of
schemes
is
a
monomorphism
in
the
case
where
the
given
morphism
of
log
schemes
is
not
scheme-like.
The
statement
of
[LgSch],
Lemma
2.6,
(ii),
is
also
divided
into
a
closed
immersion
portion,
an
isomorphism
portion,
and
a
[ﬁnal]
surjectivity
portion.
We
also
indicate,
in
the
fourth
column
of
Fig.
1,
whether
[“”]
or
not
[“×”]
the
result
in
question
is
applied,
in
an
explicit
[i.e.,
via
a
direct
reference]
logical
sense,
in
the
present
paper.
The
data
of
this
fourth
column
does
not
include
references
for
the
statements
of
deﬁnitions/conditions
or
references
made
for
the
sake
of
pointing
out
content
that
is
related
in
an
expository
sense
[i.e.,
but
not
in
a
logical
sense!].
The
unique
“”
in
this
fourth
column
in
the
case
of
[LgSch],
Proposition
2.4,
indicates
that
although
we
apply
this
result
in
an
explicit
logical
sense
in
the
present
paper
[i.e.,
despite
the
fact
that
the
proof
given
in
[LgSch]
is
in
error!],
this
does
not
result
in
any
logical
gaps,
since
the
proof
of
[LgSch],
Proposition
2.4,
given
in
[LgSch]
may
be
repaired
if,
instead
of
applying
[LgSch],
Proposition
2.3,
one
applies
Proposition
1.4,
(vi),
of
the
present
paper
[i.e.,
which
corresponds
to
the

schemes].

Next,
we
consider
the
eﬀect
of
the
errors
discussed
in
the
Introduction
of
the
present
paper
on
[ArLgSch].
Here,
we
recall
that
[ArLgSch],
§1,
consists
of
an
expository
introduction
to
the
theory
of
[ArLgSch],
while
[ArLgSch],
§2,
is
devoted
to
a
discussion
of
the
notations
and
conventions
applied
in
[ArLgSch].
Thus,
it
suﬃces
to
consider
the
eﬀect
of
the
errors
discussed
in
the
Introduction
of
the
present
paper
on
[ArLgSch],
§3,
§4,
§5.
The
eﬀect
of
these
errors
on
the
validity
of
the
statements
[second
column],
as
well
as
on
the
validity
of
the
proofs
[third
column],
of
the
individual
propositions
[“P”],
lemmas
[“L”],
corollaries
[“C”],
theorems
[“T”],
and
examples
[“E”]
of
[ArLgSch],
§3,
§4,
§5,
is
summarized
in
Fig.

below.
Here,
the
symbol
“”
indicates
no
eﬀect
on
the
validity
in
question;
the
symbol
“×”
indicates
some
eﬀect
on
the

the
numbers
in

indicate,
for
ease
of
reference,
the
corresponding
result
in
the
preprint
version
[available
on
the
homepage
http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~motizuki/papers-english.html]
of
[ArLgSch].
We
also
indicate,
in
the
fourth
column
of
Fig.

whether
[“”]
or
not
[“×”]
the
result
in
question
is
applied,
in
an
explicit
[i.e.,
via
a
direct
reference]
logical
sense,
in
the
present
paper.
The
data
of
this
fourth
column
does
not
include
references
for
the
statements
of
deﬁnitions/conditions
or
references
made
for
the
62
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
sake
of
pointing
out
content
that
is
related
in
an
expository
sense
[i.e.,
but
not
in
a
logical
sense!].
The
three
“’s”
in
this
fourth
column
indicate
the
following
state
of
aﬀairs:
·
The
results
marked
with
a
“”
are
indeed
applied
in
an
explicit
logical
sense
in
the
present
paper
in
the
proofs
of
Theorems
4.3,
4.5,
4.8
–
i.e.,
despite
the
fact
that
the
proofs
given
in
[ArLgSch]
of
these
results
are
in
error!
·
The
explicit
logical
application
of
these
results
in
the
present
paper
does
not,
however,
result
in
any
logical
gaps
for
the
following
reason:
In
the
case
of
the
ﬁrst
and
third
(respectively,
case
of
the
second)
“”,
the
only
problem
with
the
proofs
given
in
[ArLgSch]
is
that
they
rely
on
the
reconstruction
of
one-pointed
objects
given
in
[ArLgSch],
Proposition
4.3
[i.e.,
which
is
in
error!]
(respectively,
on
[ArLgSch],
Corollaries
4.2,
4.3
[i.e.,
whose
proofs
are
in
error!]).
On
the
other
hand,
these
results
are
only
applied
in
the
present
paper
in
situations
in
which
the
one-pointed
objects
have
already
been
reconstructed
(respectively,
in
which
results
corresponding
to
[ArLgSch],
Corollaries
4.2,
4.3,
have
already
been
proven).
·
Put
another
way,
one
may
think
of
the
application
in
the
present
paper
of
the
results
marked
with
a
“”
as
consisting
of
a
“similar
argument”
to
the
argument
given
in
[ArLgSch]
—
i.e.,
a
“similar
argument”
which
does
not
suﬀer
from
the
logical
gaps
of
[ArLgSch],
since,
in
the
case
of
the
ﬁrst
and
third
(respectively,
case
of
the
second)
“”,
this
“similar
argument”
is
only
applied
in
situations
in
which
the
one-pointed
objects
have
