The
Grothendieck
Conjecture
on
the
Fundamental
Groups
of
Algebraic
Curves
Hiroaki
Nakamura,
Akio
Tamagawa,
Shinichi
Mochizuki
The
“Grothendieck
Conjecture”
in
the
title
is,
in
a
word,
a
conjecture
to
the
eﬀect
that
the
arithmetic
fundamental
group
of
a
hyperbolic
algebraic
curve
completely
determines
the
algebraic
structure
of
the
curve.
Research
concerning
this
problem
was
begun
at
the
end
of
the
1980’s
by
the
ﬁrst
author
(Nakamura),
given
signiﬁcant
impetus
(including
the
case
of
positive
characteristic)
by
the
second
author
(Tamagawa),
and
brought
to
a
ﬁnal
solution
by
means
of
a
new
p-adic
interpretation
of
the
problem
due
to
the
third
author
(Mochizuki).
In
this
paper,
after
brieﬂy
reviewing
the
background
and
history
of
the
problem,
we
would
like
to
report
on
how
the
Conjecture
was
gradually
brought
to
a
solution
by
the
work
of
the
three
authors.

The
Arithmetic
Fundamental
Group
—
a
Bridge
between
Algebraic
Geometry
and
Group
Theory
—
§1.1.
The
Étale
Fundamental
Group
As
is
well-known,
the
usual
“topological
fundamental
group”
is
a
so-called
homotopy
invariant,
i.e.,
invariant
with
respect
to
continuous
deformations
of
shape.
For
instance,
in
the
case
of
a
compact
complex
algebraic
curve,
the
only
invariant
of
the
curve
determined
by
its
topological
fundamental
group
is
its
genus.
Thus,
taken
alone,
the
topological
fundamental
group
cannot
possibly
be
a
suﬃciently
ﬁne
invariant
to
distinguish
the
algebraic
structure
of
diﬀerent
algebraic
curves.
Indeed,
the
“arithmetic
fundamental
group”
appearing
in
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
is
a
notion
which
is
naturally
deﬁned
—
as
an
extension
of
the
notion
of
“Galois
group”
—
by
means
of
the
notion
of
“étale
(i.e.,
as
opposed
to
topological)
fundamental
group”
introduced
by
A.
Grothendieck.
This
notion
of
“étale
fundamental
group”
was
introduced
into
algebraic
geometry
in
the
1960’s
in
[SGA1]
as
an
accounting
device
to
keep
track
of
the
“Galois
theory
of
schemes.”
According
to
[SGA1],
given
a
geometric
point
x̄
on
a
connected
scheme
X,
the
étale
fundamental
group
π1
(X,
x̄)
is
deﬁned
as
a
group
of
permutations
of
a
system
of
“sets
of
solutions”
as
follows:
As
Y
ranges
over
all
of
the
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
(in
the
following,
we
shall
frequently
abbreviate
this
expression
by
the
phrase
“ﬁnite
coverings”)
of
X,
the
ﬁber
sets
Y
(x̄)
over
the
geometric
point
x̄
form
a
projective
system
of
ﬁnite
sets.
Then
π1
(X,
x̄)
is
deﬁned
as
the
group
formed
by
all
the
self-permutations
of
this
system
that
arise
geometrically.
Observe
that,
since
it
arises
as
the
projective
limit
of
permutation
groups
of
the
various
ﬁnite
sets
Y
(x̄),
this
group
admits
a
natural
structure
of
proﬁnite
topological
group1)
.
Since
one
knows
that
the
isomorphism
class
(as
a
topological
group)
of
the
étale
fundamental
group
does
not
depend
on
the
choice

HIROAKI
NAKAMURA,
AKIO
TAMAGAWA,
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
of
base-point
x̄
appearing
in
the
deﬁnition,
in
discussions
where
one
is
only
concerned
with
the
group-theoretic
structure
of
the
étale
fundamental
group,
we
shall
frequently
omit
the
base-point
and
write
π1
(X).
Given
an
arbitrary
ﬁnite
covering
Y
→
X,
the
set
Y
(x̄)
deﬁnes
a
continuous
ﬁnite
permutation
representation
of
π1
(X,
x̄);
moreover,
this
correspondence
(that
associates
the
permutation
representation
Y
(x̄)
to
the
covering
Y
→
X)
deﬁnes
a
categorical
equivalence
between
the
category
of
ﬁnite
coverings
of
X
and
the
category
of
continuous
ﬁnite
permutation
representations
of
π1
(X,
x̄).
In
particular,
(when
Y
is
connected)
the
stabilization
group
at
each
point
of
Y
(x̄)
determines
a
(conjugacy
class
of)
open
subgroup(s)2)
;
conversely,
an
open
subgroup
H
of
π1
(X,
x̄)
determines
(an
equivalence
class
of)
ﬁnite
connected
covering(s)
Y
→
X
corresponding
to
the
permutation
representation
on
the
set
of
left
cosets
of
π1
(X,
x̄)
with
respect
to
the
subgroup
H.
This
correspondence
H
↔
Y
appears
frequently
in
the
discussions
to
come,
so
we
will
denote
corresponding
objects
by
the
notation
Y
=
Y
H
,
H
=
HY
.
In
particular,
one
has
the
fundamental
observation
that
HY
is
none
other
than
the
fundamental
group
π1
(Y
)
of
Y
itself.
When
the
scheme
X
is
a
point,
especially,
when
it
is
the
spectrum
Spec
(K)
of
a
ﬁeld
K,
the
ﬁber
set
Y
(x̄)
of
a
connected
ﬁnite
covering
Y
is
none
other
than
the
set
of
solutions
of
the
algebraic
equations
deﬁning
Y
,
and
the
fundamental
group
π1
(Spec
(K))
may
be
identiﬁed
def
with
the
absolute
Galois
group
Gal(K)
=
Gal(K/K),
i.e.,
with
the
collection
of
“permutations
of
solutions”
of
all
possible
algebraic
equations.
(Here,
K
denotes
the
separable
closure
of
K.)
In
general,
when
one
is
given
a
morphism
of
schemes
f
:
X1
→
X2
and
a
geometric
point
x̄1
on
X1
,
if
one
denotes
the
image
of
x̄1
in
X2
by
x̄2
,
then
one
obtains
an
induced
homomorphism
π1
(X1
,
x̄1
)
→
π1
(X2
,
x̄2
).
Indeed,
the
pull-back
to
X1
(i.e.,
the
ﬁber
product
with
X1
over
the
base
X2
)
of
the
ﬁnite
étale
covering
Y
→
X2
is
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
Y

→
X1
over
X1
,
and,
moreover,
one
always
has
Y
(x̄2
)
∼
=
Y

(x̄1
).
Thus,
one
obtains
the
above
homomorphism
of
fundamental
groups
by
simply
restricting
the
corresponding
homomorphism
of
systems
of
permutation
groups.
If
one
changes
the
base-point
x̄1
,
the
resulting
homomorphism
of
fundamental
groups
is
equivalent
to
the
previous
one
(by
an
appropriate
commutative
diagram).
Thus,
in
the
following,
we
shall
frequently
omit
mention
of
the
base-point
and
simply
write
π1
(X1
)
→
π1
(X2
).
When
X
is
an
algebraic
variety
deﬁned
over
a
ﬁeld
K,
the
natural
morphisms
X
→
Spec
(K)
def
and
Spec
(K)
→
Spec
(K)
induce
a
morphism
XK
→
X
(XK
=
X
×K
K).
Moreover,
one
has
an
exact
sequence
of
fundamental
groups
(1.1)
pr
−→
Gal(K)
−→
1
1
−→
π1
(XK
)
−−−−→
π1
(X)
−−−X
arising
from
these
morphisms.
The
group
π1
(XK
),
which
forms
the
kernel
of
the
projection
prX
,
is
called
the
“geometric”
fundamental
group
of
X.
In
the
case
when
K
is
of
characteristic
0,
this
group
is
isomorphic
to
the
proﬁnite
completion
(i.e.,
the
projective
limit
of
all
the
ﬁnite
quotients)
of
the
usual
topological
fundamental
group
of
the
corresponding
complex
manifold.
Thus,
in
particular,
it
is
invariant
with
respect
to
deformations3)
.
It
is
then
natural
to
inquire
THE
GROTHENDIECK
CONJECTURE
3
as
to
how
the
“arithmetic”
fundamental
group
π1
(X)
varies
as
an
extension
of
Gal(K)
(cf.
(1.1)),
as
one
deforms
X.
In
the
above
exact
sequence
(1.1),
π1
(XK
)
is
a
normal
subgroup
of
π1
(X),
hence
determines
a
homomorphism
π1
(X)
→
Aut(π1
(XK
))
(by
conjugating
the
subgroup
π1
(XK
)
by
elements
of
π1
(X)).
This
homomorphism
clearly
maps
π1
(XK
)
into
the
group
of
inner
automorphisms
of
π1
(XK
).
Thus,
by
taking
quotients,
one
obtains
a
homomorphism
—
called
an
outer
Galois
representation
—
(1.2)
ρX
:
Gal(K)
→
Out(π1
(XK
))
from
Gal(K)
to
the
outer
automorphism
group
Out(π1
(XK
))
of
the
geometric
fundamental
group.
Just
now
we
deﬁned
ρX
:
Gal(K)
→
Out(π1
(XK
))
starting
from
prX
:
π1
(X)
→
Gal(K)
by
means
of
purely
group-theoretic
operations.
Conversely,
when
the
center
of
π1
(XK
)
is
trivial,
one
can
recover
prX
from
ρX
by
means
of
purely
group-theoretic
operations.
For
instance,
in
the
case
of
a
hyperbolic
algebraic
curve
(i.e.,
a
smooth
algebraic
curve
such
that
if
g
is
its
genus,
and
n
is
the
number
of
points
“at
inﬁnity,”
then
(g,
n)
=
(0,
0),
(0,
1),
(0,
2),
(1,
0))
deﬁned
over
a
ﬁeld
of
characteristic
0,
the
geometric
fundamental
group
is
isomorphic
to
either
a
nonabelian
free
group
or
the
proﬁnite
completion
of
a
(nonabelian)
surface
group,
hence
well-known
to
be
center-free,
so
the
above
observation
applies
in
this
case.
In
this
sort
of
situation,
to
consider
“the
outer
Galois
action
ρX
on
π1
(XK
)”
is
equivalent
to
considering
“the
group
π1
(X)
as
an
extension
of
Gal(K).”
§1.2.
Grothendieck’s
Anabelian
Conjectures
In
[G1-3],
Grothendieck
set
forth
a
collection
of
conjectures
based
on
his
intuition
that
for
varieties
X
which
are
“anabelian”
(a
vaguely
deﬁned
class
of
manifolds
that
includes
hyperbolic
algebraic
curves)
and
base
ﬁelds
K
which
are
ﬁnitely
generated
over
the
prime
ﬁeld,
the
structure
of
π1
(X)
as
an
extension
of
Gal(K)
(cf.
(1.1))
should
be
suﬃcient
to
control
the
geometry
of
X.
Most
notable
among
this
collection
of
conjectures
was
the
following
general
assertion,
which
Grothendieck
referred
to
as
the
“Fundamental
Conjecture
of
Anabelian
Algebraic
Geometry.”
(GC1)
“Fundamental
Conjecture.”
An
anabelian
algebraic
variety
X
over
a
ﬁeld
K
which
is
ﬁnitely
generated
over
a
prime
ﬁeld
may
be
“reconstituted”
from
the
structure
of
the
arithmetic
fundamental
group
π1
(X)
as
a
topological
group
equipped
with
its
associated
surjection
prX
:
π1
(X)
→
Gal(K).
Here,
the
term
“anabelian
algebraic
variety”
means
roughly
“an
algebraic
variety
whose
geometry
is
controlled
by
its
fundamental
group,
which
is
assumed
to
be
‘far
from
abelian.’
”
This
term
was
invented
by
Grothendieck.
Since
he
refrained
from
giving
a
precise
deﬁnition
of
this
term
in
arbitrary
dimension
(i.e.,
for
varieties
of
dimension
>
1),
and,
moreover,
used
the
term
“reconstituted”
in
a
similarly
ambiguous
fashion,
it
is
to
this
day
not
clear
precisely
for
which
varieties
the
conjecture
was
asserted
to
hold
in
higher
dimensions4)
.
For
algebraic
curves
in
characteristic
0,
however,
Grothendieck
himself
made
the
following
explicit
conjecture:
4
HIROAKI
NAKAMURA,
AKIO
TAMAGAWA,
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
(GC2)
The
“Hom
Conjecture.”
For
hyperbolic
algebraic
curves
X,
Y
over
a
ﬁeld
K
which
is
ﬁnitely
generated
over
the
rationals,
the
natural
map
HomK
(X,
Y
)
→
HomGal(K)
(π1
(X),
π1
(Y
))/
∼
deﬁnes
a
bijective
correspondence
between
dominant
K-morphisms
and
equivalence
classes
of
Gal(K)-compatible
open
homomorphisms
(modulo
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
induced
by
an
element
of
π1
(YK
)).
(In
other
words,
open
homomorphisms
of
the
fundamental
group
always
arise
from
algebro-geometric
morphisms.)
As
Grothendieck
himself
observes,
the
above
conjecture
bears
some
resemblance
to
the
Tate
Conjecture
(proved
by
G.
Faltings
[F1])
concerning
the
1-dimensional
étale
homology
groups
of
abelian
varieties:
HomK
(A,
B)
⊗
Ẑ
∼
=
HomGal(K)
(H1
(AK
,
Ẑ),
H1
(BK
,
Ẑ))
(Here,
A
and
B
are
abelian
varieties
deﬁned
over
a
global
ﬁeld
K,
and
Ẑ
is
the
proﬁnite
completion
of
Z.)
Moreover,
if
one
applies
the
Tate
Conjecture
together
with
the
“isogeny
theorem”
(as
well
as
the
Shafarevich
Conjecture,
etc.,
which
were
proven
by
Faltings
along
with
the
Tate
Conjecture)
to
the
Jacobian
variety
of
the
curves
in
question,
it
follows
immediately
that
there
are
only
ﬁnitely
many
curves
with
homology
group
H1
isomorphic
(as
a
Galois
module)
to
the
H1
of
a
given
proper
algebraic
curve
of
genus
≥
2.
If
one
observes
that
H1
is
just
the
abelianization
of
π1
,
then
one
may
regard
the
Fundamental
Conjecture
(GC1)
as
the
assertion
that,
if
one
increases
the
data
that
one
is
given
from
just
the
homology
group
to
the
entire
fundamental
group,
then
the
number
of
possibilities
for
a
curve
possessing
the
same
invariant
(i.e.,
the
same
π1
)
is
narrowed
down
from
some
unknown
ﬁnite
number
to
“just
one.”
In
fact,
even
eﬀective
versions
of
this
sort
of
ﬁniteness
theorem
(i.e.,
the
Shafarevich
conjecture,
etc.)
tend
(with
few
exceptions5)
)
to
give
only
inordinately
large
estimates
for
the
number
of
such
possibilities.
Thus,
from
this
point
of
view,
there
is
quite
a
substantial
gap
between
Grothendieck’s
conjectures
(GC1),
(GC2)
and
the
Tate
Conjecture
applied
to
the
Jacobian
varieties
of
the
curves
in
question.
Grothendieck
argued,
in
support
of
his
conjecture,
that
the
arithmetic
fundamental
group
π1
(X)
possesses
an
“extraordinary
rigidity,”
i.e.,
that
the
outer
action
(1.2)
of
its
“arithmetic
quotient”
Gal(K)
on
its
“geometric
portion”
π1
(XK
)
should
be
“extraordinarily
rigid,”
citing
by
way
of
comparison
the
nontriviality
of
the
Galois
representations
arising
from
cohomology
theory
which
were
studied
by
A.
Weil
and
P.
Deligne
([G3]).
Finally,
among
(unsolved)
conjectures
which
may
be
rigorously
formulated,
one
interesting
conjecture
is
the
following
“Section
Conjecture.”
A
K-rational
point
x
∈
X(K)
of
an
algebraic
variety
X
over
K
may
be
regarded
as
a
section
x
:
Spec
(K)
→
X
of
the
structure
morphism
X
→
Spec
(K).
Thus,
a
K-rational
point
x
induces
a
(π1
(XK
)-conjugacy
class
of)
section
homomorphism(s)
αx
:
Gal(K)
→
π1
(X)
which
splits
the
fundamental
exact
sequence
(1.1)
discussed
above.
(GC3)
The
Section
Conjecture.
For
an
X/K
as
in
(GC2),
every
section
homomorphism
α
:
Gal(K)
→
π1
(X)
of
the
projection
prX
:
π1
(X)
→
Gal(K)
arises
either
from
a
K-rational
point
of
X
(in
the
usual
sense),
or
from
the
K-rational
points
“at
inﬁnity”6)
of
X.
THE
GROTHENDIECK
CONJECTURE
5
We
will
discuss
the
(tangential)
sections
arising
from
the
points
at
inﬁnity
in
the
following
§.
With
respect
to
the
Hom
Conjecture,
Grothendieck
([G2])
also
mentions7)
the
possibility
of
extending
the
conjecture
to
the
case
where
X
is
an
arbitrary
smooth
algebraic
variety
and
Y
is
an
“elementary
anabelian
variety”
(i.e.,
a
variety
obtained
as
the
successive
smooth
ﬁbration
of
families
of
hyperbolic
curves).
In
this
context,
the
Section
Conjecture
may
be
regarded
as
a
variant
of
the
Hom
Conjecture
where
“X”
is
replaced
by
the
spectrum
of
the
base
ﬁeld8)
.
Grothendieck
also
considers
the
case
where
X
and
Y
are
replaced
by
the
spectra
of
function
ﬁelds
and
conjectures
that
a
“birational
version
of
the
anabelian
conjecture”9)
holds
in
this
case.
§1.3.
Concerning
the
Arithmetic
Fundamental
Group
In
his
writings
([G1-3]),
Grothendieck
also
discourses
on
various
dreams
of
his
ranging
from
the
possibility
of
treating
algebraic
curves
over
number
ﬁelds
as
graphs
on
topological
surfaces
(“dessins
d’enfant”)
to
the
explicit
description
of
the
close
relationship
between
the
arithmetic
fundamental
groups
of
various
moduli
spaces
of
curves,
to
the
possibility
of
revolutionizing
the
concept
of
a
“space”
by
means
of
a
new
categorical
point
of
view.
On
the
other
hand,
G.

Belyi’s
result
([B])
as
the
end
of
the
1970’s
to
the
eﬀect
that
the
outer
Galois
representation
(1.2)
in
the
case
K
=
Q,
X
=
P1
−
{0,
1,
∞}
is
injective
drew
the
attention
of
a
large
number
of
mathematicians
as
a
classical
example
of
the
highly
nontrivial
relationship
between
Galois
groups
and
fundamental
groups.
Ever
since
the
appearance
of
this
result,
various
research
topics
and
unsolved
problems
arising
both
from
[G1-3]
and
from
other
independent
sources
gradually
came
to
be
recognized
as
being
related
and
continue
to
this
day
to
be
the
focus
of
active
research
(e.g.,
the
inverse
Galois
problem,
mixed
motives,
adèlic
special
functions,
the
Grothendieck-Teichmüller
group,
etc.).
With
regard
to
the
numerous
important
issues
and
recent
developments
concerning
these
topics,
we
apologize
that
due
to
the
lack
of
space,
we
are
unable
to
discuss
these
topics
in
detail
in
this
paper,
and
instead
restrict
ourselves
to
quoting
several
reference
books
([1–6])
and
surveys
([I2],
[H]).
One
may
think
of
the
“Grothendieck
Conjecture”
which
is
the
topic
of
the
present
paper
as
being
simply
a
branch
–
of
a
somewhat
conceptual
hue
–
on
the
great
tree
of
numerous
research
topics
(as
discussed
above)
concerning
the
arithmetic
fundamental
group.

The
Theorem
of
Anderson-Ihara
Any
approach
to
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
must
begin
by
addressing
the
question
of
precisely
where
in
the
extension
structure
(1.1)
of
the
arithmetic
fundamental
group,
or,
alternatively,
in
the
outer
Galois
representation
(1.2)
arising
from
this
extension,
one
should
look
to
ﬁnd
some
sort
of
reﬂection
of
the
algebraic
structure
of
the
original
space.
Now
when
one
ﬁxes
a
prime
number
l,
the
outer
Galois
representation
(1.2)
also
naturally
induces

outer
action

of

In
the
1980’s,
building
on
his
previous
work,
Yasutaka
Ihara
([I1])
initiated
research
on
the
pro-l
outer
Galois
representation
associated
to
X
=
P1
−
{0,
1,
∞},
independently
of
Grothendieck
and
Deligne.
This
research
led
to
the
elucidation11)
of
the
deep
arithmeticity
(especially,
the
relationship
to
Jacobi
sums
and
circular
units)
of
this
outer
Galois
representation.
Moreover,
Ihara’s
success
spurred
researchers12)
—
mainly
in
Japan
—
to
work
on
applications
as
well
as
generalizations
to
various
other
curves
of
Ihara’s
work.
Already
by
the
late
1980’s,
the
following
fact
came
to
be
known
as
a
theorem
of
G.
AndersonIhara
([AI]).
For
a
ﬁnite
set
Λ
⊂
P1
(K)
that
contains
0,

∞,
(l)
Theorem
(Anderson
−
Ihara).
The
ﬁxed
ﬁeld
KX
of
the
kernel
of
the
pro-l
outer
Galois
(l)
representation
ρX
associated
to
a
genus
0
curve
X
=
P1K
−
Λ
is
the
extension
ﬁeld
of
K
obtained
by
adjoining
to
K
all
of
the
algebraic
numbers
arising
by
repeating
the
operations
of
taking
the
cross-ratio
and
l-th
root.
(l)
This
theorem
gives
a
description
of
the
subﬁeld
KX
of
K
which
arises
naturally
from
(l)
the
pro-l
outer
Galois
representation
ρX
by
means
of
a
system
of
“numbers”
generated
by
a
ﬁxed
procedure
from
the
coordinates
of
the
set
Λ
⊂
P1
(K)
of
ramiﬁcation
points.
From
another
point
of
view,
this
theorem
may
be
regarded
as
giving
an
explicit
construction,
for
each
prime
number
l,
of
group-theoretic
invariants
(i.e.,
the
system
of
numbers
referred
to
(l)
above)
with
values
in
the
subﬁeld
KX
of
K,
using
nothing
more
than
the
structure
of
the
arithmetic
fundamental
group
π1
(X)
as
a
Gal(K)-extension.
Nakamura’s
idea
was
to
approach
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
by
constructing,
in
a
more
systematic
fashion,
invariants
of
the
arithmetic
fundamental
group
which
are
deﬁned
as
subﬁelds
of
K
like
those
above
in
such
a
way
that
these
invariants
would
serve
to
distinguish
distinct
genus
0
algebraic
curves
more
eﬀectively.
§2.2.
A
Group-Theoretic
Description
of
Galois
Permutations
The
point
of
the
method
of
Anderson-Ihara
is
to
translate
the
pro-l
outer
Galois
representation
on
π1
(P1
−
Λ)
into
the
language
of
Galois
permutations
of
the
“pro-cusp
points”
over
Λ
distributed
on
the
“rim”
of
the
pro-l
universal
covering
of
P1
−
Λ;
this
serves
to
reduce
the
issue
of
understanding
the
outer
Galois
representation
to
the
more
manageable
task
of
understanding
the
Galois
permutations
of
the
cuspidal
points
lying
on
the
genus
0
covers
of
P1
−
Λ.
Thus,
we
shall
ﬁrst
consider
how
to
translate
the
phenomenon
of
“cuspidal
points
of
a
ﬁnite
covering
which
are
permuted
by
Galois”
into
group-theoretic
language
that
is
phrased
entirely
in
terms
of
the
group
extension
structure
of
the
arithmetic
fundamental
group.
In
general,
let
X
be
an
aﬃne
hyperbolic
curve
(of
arbitrary
genus)
deﬁned
over
K,
and
let
Y
be
a
ﬁnite
covering
of
X;
Y
∗
its
nonsingular
compactiﬁcation.
Then
the
set
of
cuspidal
def
points
of
Y
is
the
set
ΣY
=
Y
∗
−
Y
.
First
of
all,
the
natural
ﬁeld
of
deﬁnition
of
the
covering
Y
may
be
obtained
as
the
ﬁeld
KY
ﬁxed
by
the
image
of
the
open
subgroup
HY
=
π1
(Y
)
(corresponding
to
the
covering
Y
)
under
the
projection
prX
:
π1
(X)
→
Gal(K).
Next,
the
geometric
fundamental
group
of
Y
may
be
recovered
as
the
intersection
HY
∩
π1
(XK
).
If
gY
is
the
genus
of
Y
∗
,
and
nY
is
the
cardinality
of
ΣY
(K),
then
this
geometric
fundamental
group
THE
GROTHENDIECK
CONJECTURE
7
is
a
nonabelian
free
proﬁnite
group
of
rank
2gY
+
nY
−
1.
Taking
the
maximal
pro-l
abelian
(l)
quotient
of
this
group
then
gives
the
l-adic
étale
homology
group
H1
(YK
,
Zl
)
(=
π1
(YK
)ab
);
moreover,
by
conjugation,
one
sees
that
one
obtains
a
structure
of
Gal(KY
)-module
on
this
homology
group.
Now
since
the
cyclotomic
permutation
representation13)
on
the
set
of
cuspidal
points
(almost)
includes
into
this
homology
group
(as
a
submodule
of
rank
nY
−
1),
it
suﬃces
to
recover
this
submodule
group-theoretically.
That
one
can,
in
fact,
do
this
is
guaranteed
by
the
Riemann-Weil
Conjecture.
Indeed,
the
quotient
module
of
H1
(YK
,
Zl
)
by
the
“cuspidal
part”
in
question
is
of
rank
2gY
and
is,
in
fact,
isomorphic
to
the
l-adic
Tate
module
(made
up
of
the
l-power
torsion
points)
of
the
Jacobian
variety
of
Y
∗
.
The
Riemann-Weil
conjecture
asserts
that
the
radii
of
the
eigenvalues
(i.e.,
the
“weights”)
of
the
Frobenius
action
arising
from
the
action
of
Gal(KY
)
on
this
Tate
module
are
of
a
diﬀerent
size
from
the
eigenvalue(s)
arising
from
a
cyclotomic
action.
Thus,
the
cuspidal
part
of
H1
(YK
,
Zl
)
may
be
distinguished
from
the
rest
of
H1
(YK
,
Zl
)
group-theoretically.
§2.3.
Finiteness

([N1])

Now
let
us
consider,
for
instance,
those
√
Galois
coverings
Y
of
X
=
PK
−
Λ
(Λ
⊃
{0,
1,
∞})
N
whose
ﬁeld
of
deﬁnition
is
the
ﬁeld
K(
1)
and
whose
Galois
group
over
XK(
N√1)
is
equal
to
(Z/N
Z)|Λ|−1
.
If
one
then
computes
the
intersection,
ranging
over
Y
as
above
and
all
prime
numbers
l,
of
the
ﬁxed
ﬁelds
of
the
kernels
of
the
Galois
representations
on
the
cupidal
parts
of
each
H1
(YK
,
Zl
),
one
obtains
the
ﬁeld
K((λ
−
λ
)1/N
|
λ,
λ
∈
Λ
−
{∞}).
This
ﬁeld
is
an
invariant
which
can
be
group-theoretically
extracted
from
the
surjection
prX
:
π1
(X)
→
Gal(K),
whenever
a
natural
number
N
is
given.
If,
moreover,
one
lets
N
vary,
then
it
follows
from
a
simple
Kummer
theory
argument
(together
with
the
fact
that
the
group
of
units
of
a
number
ﬁeld
is
ﬁnitely
generated)
that
the
subgroup
generated
inside
the
multiplicative
group
K
×
by
the
ﬁnite
set
{λ
−
λ
|
λ,
λ
∈
Λ
−
{∞},
λ
=
λ
}
is
also,
therefore,
a
grouptheoretic
invariant.
This
invariant
shows,
among
other
things,
that
(up
to
linear
fractional
transformations)
there
are
only
ﬁnitely
many
subsets
Λ
⊂
P1
(K)
that
give
rise
to
the
same
arithmetic
fundamental
group,
as
well
as
that,
in
the
case
of
certain
special
number
ﬁelds
K,
the
(outer
action
on
the
meta-abelianization
of
the
geometric)
fundamental
group
already
determines
a
curve
of
the
form
P1
−
{
４
points}.
§2.4.
Rigidity
Theorems
In
order
to
use
the
information
arising
from
the
Galois
permutations
of
the
cuspidal
points
more
eﬃciently,
this
time
we
would
like
to
consider
the
information
that
one
obtains
from
the
cuspidal
part
⊂
H1
((Y
H
)K
,
Zl
)
of
the
homology
of
the
covering
Y
H
associated
to
H,
where
we
let
H
vary,
as
a
parameter,
among
all
the
open
subgroups
of
π1
(X).
(As
was
stated
in
§2.2)
this
cupsidal
part
may
be
characterized
by
the
weight
ﬁltration.
Thus,
if
one
considers
the
union
of
the
cyclic
subgroups
I
of
π1
(XK
)
that
land
inside
the
cuspidal
part
of
the
l-adic
homology
(for
all
prime
numbers
l)
of
all
open
subgroups
H
of
π1
(XK
)
that
contain
I,
then
one
obtains
a
subset
of
π1
(XK
)
which
may
be
constructed
entirely
group-theoretically
from
the
Gal(K)-extension
group
π1
(X).
One
can
show
that
this
subset
is
precisely
the
union
of
(all
conjugates
of)
the
“cuspidal
isotropy
subgroups,”
that
is
to
say,
the
union
of
all
the
inertia
groups
(∼
=
Ẑ)
inside
π1
(XK
)

at
the
points
at
inﬁnity
of
X
(i.e.,
the
cuspidal
points
of
X
itself)
—
cf.
the
“anabelian
weight
ﬁltration”
of
[N2,4].
One
can
then
recover
the
decomposition
groups
inside
π1
(X)
as
the
normalizers
of
the
inertia
groups.
The
section
homomorphisms
α
:
Gal(K)
→
π1
(X)
of
the
projection
prX
:
π1
(X)
→
Gal(K)
whose
images
lie
inside
a
decomposition
group
are
then
called
the
tangential
sections
arising
from
the
K-rational
points
at
inﬁnity
of
X.
Among
those
section
homomorphisms
that
are
at
issue
in
Grothendieck’s
Section
Conjecture
(GC3),
those
arising
from
the
K-rational
points
at
inﬁnity
may
thus
be
given
a
group-theoretic
characterization
in
this
way.
Now
since
we
have
given
a
group-theoretic
characterization
of
the
set
of
inertia
groups
(as
well
as
the
corresponding
decomposition
groups),
if,
for
instance,
we
are
given
an
isomorphism
π1
(X1
)
∼
=
π1
(X2
)
over
Gal(K)
between
the
arithmetic
fundamental
groups
of
two
curvess
X1
and
X2
over
K,
then
this
group
isomorphism
must
automatically
preserve
the
set
of
inertia
groups,
as
well
as
the
residue
ﬁelds
of
the
various
corresponding
points
at
inﬁnity
(since
these
residue
ﬁelds
are
just
the
ﬁxed
ﬁelds
of
the
image
under
prX
of
the
corresponding
decomposition
group
in
Gal(K)).
Therefore,
if
X1
may
be
embedded
in
X1
,
then
X2
may
also
be
embedded
in
some
X2
such
that
π1
(X1
)
∼
=
π1
(X2
).
In
particular,
the
problem
of
reconstructing
(from
their
arithmetic
fundamental
groups)
curves
P1
−
{n
points}
of
genus
0
(where
n
is
arbitrary)
may
be
reduced
to
the
case
where
n
=
4.
If,
moreover,
one
uses
the
fact
that
one
can
specify
those
geometric
cyclic
covers
that
ramify
only
at
two
points
entirely
in
the
language
of
fundamental
groups
and
inertia
groups,
one
sees
that
by
applying
the
method
of
[N1],
one
can
extract
(as
λ

of
multiplicative
subgroups
an
invariant
of
π1
(P1
−
{0,
1,
∞,
λ}))
the
triple
λ,
1
−
λ,

λ−1
×
of
K
.
This
is,
in
fact,
suﬃcient
to
characterize
the
isomorphism
class
of
P1
−
{0,
1,
∞,
λ}.
In
this
way,
one
can
show
that
hyperbolic
algebraic
curves
of
genus
0
over
a
ﬁeld
which
is
ﬁnitely
generated
over
Q
may
be
“reconstituted”
from
their
arithmetic
fundamental
groups
([N2]).
Moreover,
since
the
characterization
of
inertia
groups
may
be
applied
even
to
the
pro-l
fundamental
groups
of
aﬃne
curves
of
arbitrary
genus,
the
possibility
thus
arose
of
approaching
a
version
of
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
reformulated
for
the
pro-l
fundamental
group
“quantitatively”
via
the
lower
central
series
(of
the
pro-l
fundamental
group).
In
particular,
when
one
specializes
this
to
the
problem
of
computing
the
group
of
(Galois-compatible)
automorphisms
of
the
pro-l
fundamental
group,
one
can
to
some
extent
systematically
obtain
aﬃrmative
results
by
combining
one’s
knowledge
of
the
pro-l
outer
Galois
representations
of
curves
of
higher
genus
and
their
conﬁguration
spaces
by
means
of
a
method
involving
various
ﬁltrations
(cf.
the
survey
[N7],
as
well
as
[NTs],[NTa],[MT],
etc.).
One
can
regard
this
problem
of
reconstructing
the
automorphism
groups
of
curves
from
the
groups
of
Galois-compatible
automorphisms
of
their
geometric
fundamental
groups
as
a
preliminary
ﬁrst
step
to
the
isomorphism
version
of
(GC2).
However,
in
order
to
obtain
a
more
decisive
breakthrough,
one
had
to
ﬁrst
wait
for
the
work
of
Tamagawa
(§3).
Incidentally,
this
procedure
that
we
carried
out
above
for
the
tangential
sections
arising
from
the
points
at
inﬁnity,
i.e.,

may
also
be
seen
in
the

work
of
Tamagawa
and
Mochizuki.
Moreover,
in
the
course
of
carrying
out
this
procedure,
it
became
standard
in
this
later
work
to
apply
the
method
by
“compiling
in

the

data
included
in

H
that
arise
when
one
allows
H
to
vary
as
a

among
all
the
open

of

(X).
On
the
other
hand,
the
issues
of
just
what
geometric
information
one
extracts
from
the

cohomology
of
Y
H
in
the
various
arithmetic
settings
that
arise
(in
the

work
of
Tamagawa
and
Mochizuki),
and
how
one
compiles
this
information
in
order
to
arrive
at
the
ﬁnal
result
are
highly
nontrivial
problems
which
required
more
sophisticated
technology
and
fresh
ideas
to
solve.
In
the
following
sections,
we
will
discuss
the
development
of
the

of
Tamagawa

Mochizuki
that
were
applied
to

these

of
the

the

issues
that

step,
in
as
pedestrian
a
fashion
as
is
possible.
§3.
The
Grothendieck
Conjecture
and
the
Fundamental
Groups
of
Algebraic
Curves
in
Positive
Characteristic
§3.1.
The
Grothendieck
Conjecture
over
Finite
Fields
In
this
§,
we
let
k
be
a
ﬁnite
ﬁeld,
and
X
a
(nonsingular)
aﬃne
curve
over
k.
One
of
the
main
results
of
Tamagawa
([T1])
states
that
the
scheme
X
may
be
recovered
from
π1
(X)
(more
precisely,
this
is
an
analogue
of
the
isomorphism
version
of
(GC2)).
The
proof
of
this
result
is
modeled
on
the
work
of
K.
Uchida
([U]),
who
showed
that
the
function
ﬁeld
k(X)
may
be
recovered
from
its
absolute
Galois
group
Gal(k(X)),
and
may
be
roughly
divided
into
three
steps:
(i)
the
group-theoretic
characterization
of
the
decomposition
groups
of
each
closed
point
of
X
∗;
(ii)
the
reconstruction
of
the
multiplicative
group
k(X)×
；
(iii)
the
reconstruction
of
the
additive
structure
on
k(X)
=
k(X)×
∪
{0}.
Here,
just
as
in
§2,
we
denote
the
nonsingular
compactiﬁcation
of
X
by
X
∗
.
In
Step
(i),
Uchida
used
an
idea
of
Neukirch
involving
Brauer
groups,
but
in
our
case,
since
the
inertia
groups
of
the
closed
points
of
X
are
trivial,
the
decomposition
groups
of
these
points
are
isomorphic
to
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
their
residue
ﬁelds
(which
are
ﬁnite
ﬁelds),
hence
have
no
(nonzero)
H
2
.
Thus,
we
shall
use
instead
an
idea
that
we
explain
in
the
following.
First,
observe
that
each
closed
point
of
X
deﬁnes
a
continuous
group
homomorphism
αx
:
Gal(k(x))
=
π1
(Spec
(k(x)))
→
π1
(X)
10
HIROAKI
NAKAMURA,

such
that
prX
◦
αx
coincides
with
the
natural
injection
Gal(k(x))
→
Gal(k),
and
that
the
image
of
αx
is
the
decomposition
group
of
x.
In
particular,
when
x
is
a
k-rational
point,
the
homomorphism
αx
determines
a
section
of
prX
.
Below,
for
simplicity,
we
shall
concentrate
on
this
case
(where
x
is
k-rational).
The
problem
then
is
to
give
a
group-theoretic
condition
that
will
guarantee
that
an
arbitrary
section
homomorphism
α
of
prX
in
fact
arises
as
the
αx
of
some
x
∈
X(k).
(Observe
that
since
Gal(k)
∼
=
Ẑ
is
a
free
proﬁnite
group,
the
precise
analogue
of
the
Section
Conjecture
(GC3)
could
not
possibly
hold.)
First,
let
us
note
that
the
condition
in
question
is
equivalent
to
the
following:
(∗)
For
any
open
subgroup
H
of
π1
(X)
that
contains
the
image
Im(α)
of
α,
the
set
of
k-rational
points
Y
H
(k)
of
the
corresponding
covering
Y
H
of
X
is
nonempty.
Indeed,
necessity
follows
immediately
from
the
fundamental
properties
of
the
decomposition
group,
while
suﬃciency
follows
from
the
following
argument:
Since
any
projective
limit
of
nonempty
ﬁnite
sets
is
itself
nonempty,
the
(pro-)covering
of
X
corresponding
to
the
subgroup
Im(α)
of
π1
(X)
possesses
a
k-rational
point.
Hence,
if
one
takes
such
a
k-rational
point
of
this
(pro-)covering
and
denotes
the
image
of
this
point
in
X
by
x,
one
sees
immediately
that
α
=
αx
.
Thus,
it
remains
to
solve
the
problem
of
how
to
determine
group-theoretically
from
the
arithmetic
fundamental
group
whether
or
not
(∗)
holds,
or,
more
generally,
just
when
a
curve
over
a
ﬁnite
ﬁeld
k
admits
a
rational
point.
This
problem
may
be
solved
by
using
the
Lefshetz
Trace
Formula,
which
allows
one
to
calculate
the
number
(≥
0)
of
rational
points
by
means
of
the
action
of
the
Frobenius
element
on
l-adic
étale
cohomology
(where
l
is
a
prime
def
number
distinct
from
the
characteristic
of
k).
For
the
points
at
inﬁnity
x
∈
Σ
=
X
∗
−
X,
the
inertia
group
is
nontrivial,
so
the
section
homomorphism
αx
into
the
decomposition
group
is
not
uniquely
determined;
moreover,
(unlike
the
case
of
points
x
∈
X(k))
the
image
of
αx
is
a
proper
subgroup
of
the
decomposition
group.
Nevertheless,
in
this
case,
as
well,
if
one
applies
a
slightly
modiﬁed
version
of
the
above
argument,
for
each
x
∈
Σ,
one
can
group-theoretically
reconstruct
the
inﬁnite
set
of
all
possible
αx
’s.
Thus,
one
can
reconstruct
the
decomposition
group
of
x
as
the
subgroup
of
π1
(X)
generated
by
the
union
of
the
images
of
all
possible
αx
’s.
Step
(ii)
is
almost
the
same
as
in
[U]:
one
uses
the
reciprocity
law
of
class
ﬁeld
theory,
applied
to
the
function
ﬁeld
k(X).
Originally,
the
point
of
class
ﬁeld
theory
was
to
calculate
the
abelianization
of
the
Galois
group
of
a
ﬁeld
by
means
of
some
multiplicative
groups
arising
from
the
ﬁeld;
here,
however,
we
view
things
in
reverse,
i.e.,
we
think
of
the
data
of
the
multiplicative
groups
associated
to
a
ﬁeld
as
being
encoded
inside
the
abelianized
Galois
group.
Since
we
have
already
reconstructed
the
decomposition
groups
associated
to
each
closed
point
x
of
X
∗
in
Step
(i),
it
thus
follows
from
local
class
ﬁeld
theory
that
we
have
reconstructed
(as
the
“Weil

×
/O
×
group
part”
of
the
abelianization
of
the
decomposition
group),
for
x
∈
X,
the
group
K
x
x

×
,
as
well
as
the
natural
morphisms
K


(∼
=
Z),
and,
for
x
∈
Σ,
the
group
K



→
π1

.
(Here,
O

,
and
K

denotes
the

may
also
be
reconstructed
group-theoretically
just
from
π1
(X),
hence
the
same
may
be
said
of
its
kernel,
which
is
simply
the
multiplicative
group
k(X)×
.
(Here,
we
use
for
the
ﬁrst
time
that
X
is
af
f
ine.
If
X
=
X
∗
,
then
we
are
only
able
to
reconstruct
the
group
k(X)×
/k
×
of
principal
divisors.)
Step
(iii)
is
the
most
technically
diﬃcult
step.
First
of
all,
observe
that
in
Step
(ii),
we
reconstructed
not
only
the
multiplicative
group
k(X)×
,
but
also
the
discrete
valuation
ordx
:
k(X)×
→
Z
associated
to
each
closed
point
x
of
X
∗
,
as
well
as
(for
x
∈
Σ)
the
(kernel
of
the)
×
×
reduction
map
Ker(ordx
)
=
OX
∗
,x
→
k(x)
.
Now
in
[U],
one
ﬁrst
reconstructs
the
additive
structure
of
the
base
ﬁeld
k
(or
of
k̄),
then
(since
“Σ
=
X
∗
”),
by
using
the
reduction
map
for
an
inﬁnite
number
of
points,
one
reconstructs
the
additive
structure
of
the
function
ﬁeld
from
the
additive
structure
of
the
various
residue
ﬁelds.
In
our
case,
(since
Σ
is
a
ﬁnite
set)
this
ﬁnal
part
of
the
argument
does
not
work.
Instead,
one
takes
“lots”
of
“nice”
functions
f
∈
k(X)
(i.e.,
functions
“like”
the
function
t
on
X
=
P1k
−
{0,
1,
∞}
=
Spec
(k[t,
t−1
,
(t
−
1)−1
]));
then,
by
using
the
various
special
properties
of
the
rational
function
ﬁeld,
one
recovers
the
additive
structure
of
the
subﬁeld
k(f
)
⊂
k(X);
and
ﬁnally,
by
“gluing
together”
the
additive
structures
of
these
various
subﬁelds,
one
recovers
the
additive
structure
of
the
original
function
ﬁeld
k(X).
§3.2.
From
Finite
Fields
to
Finitely
Generated
Fields
When
X
is,
in
addition,
hyperbolic,
the
results
and
proofs
which
we
explained
in
§3.1
remain
valid
when
one
replaces
the
full
(arithmetic)
fundamental
group
π1
(X)
by
the
tame
fundamental
group
π1tame
(X)
(which
is
a
quotient
of
π1
(X)).
In
this
§,
we
will
explain
how
the
isomorphism
version
of
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
(GC2)
for
aﬃne
hyperbolic
curves
over
ﬁelds
which
are
ﬁnitely
generated
over
the
rational
number
ﬁeld
may
be
derived
from
our
results
concerning
the
tame
fundamental
group
of
aﬃne
hyperbolic
curves
over
a
ﬁnite
ﬁeld.
In
§1.2,
we
pointed
out
the
analogy
between
the
Tate
Conjecture
and
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture,
but
in
the
case
of
the
Tate
Conjecture,
it
seems
highly
unlikely
that
it
is
possible
to
derive
Faltings’
Theorem
via
a
simple
argument
which
does
not
involve
genuinely
global
considerations
from
Tate’s
Theorem
(which
amounts
to
the
Tate
Conjecture
over
ﬁnite
ﬁelds).
This
is
one
diﬀerence
between
the
arithmetic
nature
of
these
two
conjectures
(cf.
also
§4.1).
Since
it
is
easy
to
derive
the
case
over
a
ﬁnitely
generated
extension
of
the
rational
number
ﬁeld
from
the
case
over
a
number
ﬁeld,
in
the
following
we
shall
consider
the
case
where
K
is
a
number
ﬁeld,
and
X
is
an
aﬃne
hyperbolic
curve
over
K.
The
problem
is
to
show
how
to
recover
group-theoretically
the
tame
fundamental
group
of
the
reduction
of
X
at
each
ﬁnite
prime
of
K
from
the
arithmetic
fundamental
group
of
X
itself.
Here,
a
key
role
is
played
by
the
fact
that
one
can
determine
whether
or
not
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
a
local
ﬁeld
has
good
reduction
by
looking
at
whether
or
not
the
outer
action
of
the
inertia
group
(of
the
local
ﬁeld)
on
the
pro-l
fundamental
group
(where
l
is
a
prime
number
which
is
distinct
from
the
characteristic
of
the
residue
ﬁeld)
is
trivial.
This
fact
is
the
analogue
for
hyperbolic
curves
of
the
good
reduction
criterion
of
Serre-Tate
for
abelian
varieties.
(This
group-theoretic
good
reduction
criterion
for
hyperbolic
curves
is
due
in
the
proper
case
to
T.
Oda
([O1,2]).)
Now
we
let
v
be
a
ﬁnite
prime
of
K,
Kv
be
the
v-adic
completion
of
K,
Ov
be
its
ring
of
integers,
and
kv
be
its
residue
ﬁeld.
Then
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
Kv
may
be
naturally
regarded
as
a
subgroup
of
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
K;
moreover,
the
geometric
fundamental
12
HIROAKI
NAKAMURA,
AKIO
TAMAGAWA,
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
group
of
X
coincides
with
the
geometric
fundamental
group
of
XKv
,
so
one
may
immediately
recover
the
arithmetic
fundamental
group
π1
(XKv
)
of
XKv
as
pr−1
X
(Gal(Kv
))
(in
the
notation
of
(1.1)).
If
we
then
apply
to
this
arithmetic
fundamental
group
the
above
criterion,
we
can
determine
group-theoretically
whether
or
not
XKv
has
good
reduction.
Thus,
in
the
following,
we
shall
assume
that
XKv
has
good
reduction;
then
we
let
XOv
be
the
“good”
model
of
XKv
over
Ov
,
and
Xkv
be
its
reduction
modulo
the
maximal
ideal
of
Ov
.
Since,
under
these
circumstances,
it
is
known
that
π1tame
(Xkv
)
and
π1
(XOv
)
are
naturally
isomorphic,
one
may
identify
π1tame
(Xkv
)
with
the
quotient
π1
(XOv
)
of
π1
(XKv
).
In
order
to
recover
this
quotient
group-theoreticaly,
it
is
suﬃcient
to
be
able
to
determine
group-theoretically,
for
every
ﬁnite
étale
(Galois)
covering
of
XKv
,
whether
or
not
this
covering
can
be
extended
to
an
étale
covering
over
XOv
.
But
by
hyperbolicity,
it
follows
that
this
is,
in
fact,
equivalent
to
the
(at
ﬁrst
sight
weaker)
condition
that
the
covering
curve
also
have
good
reduction;
thus,
one
may
apply
the
preceding
criterion
to
determine
group-theoretically
whether
or
not
this
condition
holds.
From
the
above
argument,
it
thus
follows
that
whenever
a
hyperbolic
curve
X
over
a
number
ﬁeld
K
has
good
reduction
at
the
prime
v,
one
can
reconstruct
group-theoretically
the
tame
fundamental
group
of
the
reduction
Xkv
(as
a
certain
subquotient
of
the
arithmetic
fundamental
group
of
X).
Now
if
one
is
given
an
isomorphism
π1
(X1
)
∼
=
π1
(X2
)
over
Gal(K)
between
the
arithmetic
fundamental
groups
of
two
aﬃne
hyperbolic
curves
X1
and
X2
over
a
number
ﬁeld
K,
then
from
the
above
argument,
one
sees
that
one
gets
an
induced
isomorphism
π1tame
((X1
)kv
)
∼
=
tame
π1
((X2
)kv
)
at
almost
all
of
the
primes
v
of
K
(i.e.,
those
primes
at
which
X1
and
X2
have
good
reduction).
Thus,
one
obtains
an
isomorphism
(X1
)kv
∼
=
(X2
)kv
from
the
above
result
concerning
the
tame
fundamental
groups
of
aﬃne
hyperbolic
curves
over
ﬁnite
ﬁelds.
On
the
other
hand,
from
the
hyperbolicity
of
the
curves
(which
implies,
in
particular,
that
the
scheme
Isom
of
isomorphisms
between
the
two
curves
is
ﬁnite
over
the
base),
it
follows
that
at
almost
all
v,
one
has:
Isom(X1
,
X2
)
∼
=
Isom((X1
)kv
,
(X2
)kv
)
which
thus
implies
that
X1
∼
=
X2
.
This
completes
the
proof
that
one
may
derive
the
isomorphism
version
of
(GC2)
for
aﬃne
hyperbolic
curves
over
number
ﬁelds
from
the
result
discussed
above
concerning
tame
fundamental
groups
of
aﬃne
hyperbolic
curves
over
ﬁnite
ﬁelds.
Moreover,
in
[M1],
Mochizuki
derives
an
isomorphism
version
of
(GC2)
for
proper
hyperbolic
curves
over
number
ﬁelds
from
the
above
results
on
the
tame
fundamental
group
of
aﬃne
hyperbolic
curves
over
ﬁnite
ﬁelds.
Here,
the
key
theorem
that
connects
these
two
results
is
an
isomorphism
version
of
(GC2)
for
the
“log
fundamental
group”
of
(nonsmooth)
stable
curves
over
ﬁnite
ﬁelds.
§3.3.
The
Geometric
Fundamental
Group
of
Algebraic
Curves
in
Positive
Characteristic
In
the
case
of
characteristic
0,
the
isomorphism
class
of
the
geometric
fundamental
group
of
a
curve
is
determined
solely
by
its
genus
g
and
the
number
n
of
points
at
inﬁnity
of
the
curve,
but
this
does
not
hold
in
positive
characteristic.
Indeed,
in
[T2],
it
is
proven
that
the
isomorphism
class
(as
a
scheme)
of
a
curve
of
genus
0
over
Fp
is
completely
determined
by
THE
GROTHENDIECK
CONJECTURE
13
its
(geometric)
fundamental
group.
It
is
of
interest
to
determine
whether
this
sort
of
result
holds
in
general
for
arbitrary
(hyperbolic)
algebraic
curves
over
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
of
positive
characteristic,
and
whether
or
not
an
analogous
result
holds
when
“fundamental
group”
is
replaced
by
“tame
fundamental
group.”
§4.
Motivation
for
the
Version
over
Local
Fields
§4.1.
Global
Fields
and
Local
Fields
In
§1,
we
introduced
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
as
a
conjecture
that
concerns
objects
over
global
ﬁelds,
i.e.,
ﬁelds
such
as
ﬁnitely
generated
extensions
of
the
rational
number
ﬁeld,
which
have
lots
of
primes.
By
contrast,
Mochizuki’s
series
of
papers
([M1-4])
introduced
the
new
point
of
view
that
one
should
in
fact
regard
this
conjecture
as
a
p-adic
analytic
phenomenon
whose
natural
base
is
a
local,
not
a
global,
ﬁeld.
The
Grothendieck
Conjecture
over
local
ﬁelds
(§5.1),
which
was
obtained
by
starting
from
this
point
of
view,
is
a
general
result
which
includes
the
original
conjecture
(GC2)
formulated
over
ﬁelds
which
are
ﬁnitely
generated
over
the
rationals.
Before
we
discuss
this
new
point
of
view
and
the
results
that
arose
from
it,
however,
we
would
ﬁrst
like
to
examine
the
circumstances
that
existed
prior
to
Mochizuki’s
work
which
led
people
to
believe
that
the
the
natural
base
ﬁeld
for
the
conjecture
should
be
a
global
ﬁeld.
(A)
The
Tate
Conjecture
for
Abelian
Varieties:
As
was
discussed
in
§1,
Grothendieck,
in
the
course
of
formulating
his
anabelian
conjectures,
pointed
out
the
analogy
between
these
conjectures
and
the
Tate
Conjecture
proved
by
Faltings
([F1]).
This
proof
of
Faltings,
however,
uses
in
an
essential
way
such
global
tools
as
the
theory
of
heights
over
number
ﬁelds,
together
with
the
fact
that,
when
one
considers
how
the
height
varies
under
an
isogeny
of
abelian
varieties,
the
contributions
that
arise
from
the
ﬁnite
and
inﬁnite
primes
occur
in
such
a
way
as
to
just
cancel
each
other
out.
Moreover,
unlike
the
case
with
number
ﬁelds
(and
ﬁnite
ﬁelds),
over
such
local
ﬁelds
as
Qp
,
not
only
does
the
Tate
Conjecture
not
hold,
but,
in
many
cases,
the
gap
between
the
two
modules
which
are
expected
to
be
isomorphic
is
quite
large.
Thus,
if
one
takes
the
point
of
view
that
“The
Grothendieck
Conjecture=
The
Tate
Conjecture
for
Hyperbolic
Curves”
then
it
is
most
natural
to
consider
a
conjecture
such
as
(GC2)
only
over
global
ﬁelds.
(B)
Applications
to
Diophantine
Geometry:
Among
those
mathematicians
who
were
involved
with
the
anabelian
philosophy
in
its
early
years,
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
appears
to
have
been
thought
of
as
a
new
approach
to
Diophantine
Geometry,
i.e.,
to
the
study
of
rational
points
on
varieties
over
global
ﬁelds.
The
following
argument
is
representative
of
this
approach.
Suppose
that
we
wish
to
show
that
a
certain
algebraic
variety
has
only
ﬁnitely
many
rational
points.
We
then
assume
that
there
are
inﬁnitely
many
and
attempt
to
derive
a
contradiction
by
showing
that
any
rational
point
arising
as
a
“limit”
of
this
inﬁnite
set
of
rational
points
has
various
properties
that
are
“too
good
to
be
true.”
In
order
to
carry
out
this
argument,
however,
one
needs
to
know
that
the
“limit”
exists.
Since
a
ﬁeld
like
a
number
14
HIROAKI
NAKAMURA,
AKIO
TAMAGAWA,
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
ﬁeld
is
not
complete
with
respect
to
any
nontrivial
topology,
the
existence
of
such
a
limit
is
by
no
means
clear.
On
the
other
hand,
since
Galois
representations
(as
in
(1.2))
are,
in
some
sense,
analytic
objects,
it
is
comparatively
easy
to
show
that
a
sequence
of
such
Galois
representations
always
has
a
convergent
subsequence
(i.e.,
a
subsequence
whose
limit
exists,
as
a
Galois
representation).
Thus,
if
one
knows,
as
is
asserted
in
the
Section
Conjecture
(GC3),
that
rational
points
and
Galois
representations
(which
satisfy
certain
conditions)
are,
in
fact,
equivalent
objects,
then
one
can
conclude
the
existence
of
a
limit
of
a
sequence
of
rational
points
from
the
existence
of
the
limit
of
the
corresponding
sequence
of
Galois
representations.
If
one
reﬁnes
this
argument
somewhat,
then
the
possibility
arises
of
deriving
a
new
proof
of
the
“Mordell
Conjecture”14)
for
algebraic
curves
of
high
genus
from
the
Section
Conjecture
(GC3).
Thus,
if
one
has
in
mind
such
essentially
global
applications
as
the
preceding
argument,
then
it
is
most
natural
to
consider
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
only
over
global
ﬁelds.
It
was
under
these
circumstances
that
the
transformation
of
ideas
“from
global
to
p-adic
ﬁelds”
was
bought
about
by
the
work
of
Mochizuki.
Below
we
would
like
to
explain
the
point
of
view
that
gave
rise
to
this
transformation.
§4.2.
The
Analogy
with
the
Uniformization
Theory
of
Hyperbolic
Riemann
Surfaces
The
thrust
of
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
is,
in
a
word,
that
one
can
recover
a
hyperbolic
curve
from
its
associated
outer
Galois
representation
(1.2),
i.e.,
from:
The
Geometric
π1
of
the
Curve
＋
Some
Natural
“Arithmetic
Structure”
on
this
π1
In
fact,
if
one
forgets
about
the
global
nature
of
the
base
ﬁeld
and
interprets
the
expression
“arithmetic
structure”
in
a
broad
sense,
then
one
sees
that
in
fact
a
phenomenon
analogous
to
this
conjecture
was
already
known
to
mathematicians
in
the
nineteenth
century.
This
phenomenon
is
the
uniformization
theory
of
hyperbolic
Riemann
surfaces.
If
one
is
given
a
hyperbolic
curve
X
over
the
complex
number
ﬁeld
C,
then
X
deﬁnes
a
Riemann
surface
X
of
hyperbolic
type.
Thus,
the
universal
covering
X˜
→
X
of
this
Riemann
surface
X
also
admits
a
natural
structure
of
Riemann
surface.
Now
by
the
uniformization
theorem
for
Riemann
surfaces,
one
knows
that
X˜
is
holomorphically
isomorphic
to
the
upper
def
half-plane
H
=
{z
∈
C
|
Im(z)
>
0}.
Thus,
if
one
uses
the
fact
that
Aut(X˜
)
∼
=
Aut(H)
=
SL2
(R)/{±1},
then
one
obtains
a
canonical
representation
(deﬁned
up
to
conjugation
by
an
element
of
SL2
(R)/{±1})
(4.1)
ρX
:
π1
(X
)
→
SL2
(R)/{±1}
from
the
action
of
the
(usual
topological)
fundamental
group
π1
(X
)
of
the
Riemann
surface
X
on
X˜
.
Conversely,
if
one
is
given
ρX
,
then
the
action
of
π1
(X
)
on
the
upper
half
plane
H
is
determined;
thus,
by
forming
the
quotient
of
H
by
this
action,
one
can
recover
the
Riemann
surface
X
,
as
well
as
the
original
algebraic
curve
X,
practically
eﬀortlessly.
Well
aware
of
these
circumstances
in
the
world
of
complex
analysis,
and
spurred
on
further
by
the
observation
that
THE
GROTHENDIECK
CONJECTURE
15
both
the
ρX
of
(1.2)
and
the
ρX
of
(4.1)
ﬁt
into
the
same
pattern
of
“geometric
π1
of
the
curve
+
some
‘arithmetic
structure’
on
this
π1
,”
Mochizuki
was
led
to
pose
the
following
question:
Is
there
a
p-adic
analogue
of
the
phenomenon
that
one
can
(re)construct
X
(every
so
directly
and
naturally!)
from
the
representation
ρX
?
In
fact,
the
p-adic
version
of
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
(Theorem
5.1)
that
we
will
discuss
below
(§5)
may
be
regarded
as
giving
a
sort
of
aﬃrmative
answer
to
this
question15)
.
One
classical
method
for
concretely
constructing
the
algebraic
curve
X
from
the
action
of
the
geometric
fundamental
group
π1
(X
)
on
H
is
to
manufacture
diﬀerential
forms
on
H
which
are
invariant
under
the
action
of
π1
(X
).
If
one
can
manufacture
enough
such
diﬀerential
forms,
then
one
can
deﬁne
a
morphism
φ
:
H
→
PX
from
the
upper
half-plane
H
to
some
sort
of
projective
space
PX
.
It
follows
immediately
from
the
general
theory
of
complex
manifolds
that
the
image
of
this
morphism
is
an
algebraic
variety;
moreover,
in
this
case,
(if
one
imposes
a
certain
weak
technical
condition
on
X)
it
follows
that
this
image
is,
in
fact,
equal
to
X
itself.
This
argument
is
the
same
as
that
which
is
used
to
prove,
when
one
constructs
Shimura
varieties
as
quotients
of
symmetric
spaces,
that
these
quotients
are,
in
fact,
algebraic
varieties.
In
summary,
the
main
point
of
this
sort
of
argument
is
that
although
one
may
ultimately
conclude
that
the
diﬀerential
forms
that
we
use
to
deﬁne
φ
are,
in
fact,
algebraic,
during
the
construction
of
φ,
these
diﬀerential
forms
exist
only
as
analytic
objects
on
H.
This
point
of
view
of
“dealing
with
analytic
presentations
of
algebraic
diﬀerential
forms”
will
also
play
an
important
role
in
the
proof
of
Theorem
5.1
which
we
will
discuss
below.
§4.3.
The
Relationship
to
p
-adic
Hodge
Theory
With
regard
to
proving
Theorem
5.1,
the
analogy
with
the
theory
over
the
ﬁeld
of
complex
numbers
which
we
discussed
in
the
preceding
§
provides
us
with
at
least
one
clue,
but
in
order
to
actually
realize
this
analogy
in
the
p-adic
world,
one
needs
to
employ
fairly
advanced
technology.
This
technology
is
provided
by
the
p-adic
Hodge
theory
([F2])
of
Faltings.
That
theory
which
is
referred
to
as
“p-adic
Hodge
theory”
has
a
long
history
going
back
to
Tate’s
pioneering
work
in
the
mid-1960’s;
what
is
important
here,
however,
is
the
deep
similarity
between
this
theory
and
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture.
The
main
theme
of
p-adic
Hodge
theory
is
the
so-called
“comparison
theorem”
between
the
étale
cohomology
(equipped
with
its
natural
Galois
action)
and
the
de
Rham
cohomology
of
a
variety
over
a
p-adic
ﬁeld
(such
as
a
ﬁnite
extension
ﬁeld
of
Qp
).
In
other
words,
the
sense,
or
conjecture,
that
there
should
exist
some
sort
of
“mysterious
functor”
that
converts
these
two
types
of
cohomologies
into
one
another
is
the
starting
point
of
p-adic
Hodge
theory.
Here,
de
Rham
cohomology
is
an
invariant
of
the
variety
obtained
by
compiling
into
a
single
complex
the
various
properties
of
the
polynomial
functions
and
diﬀerentials
of
such
functions
on
X.
Observe
that
the
set
of
morphisms
between
algebraic
varieties
which
appears
in
the
left-hand
side
of
(GC2)
belongs
to
the
same
world
of
algebraic
geometry
(i.e.,
polynomial
functions).
On
the
other
hand,
the
geometric
fundamental
16
HIROAKI
NAKAMURA,
AKIO
TAMAGAWA,
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
group
equipped
with
its
outer
Galois
action,
which
appears
on
the
right-hand
side
of
(GC2),
is
(if
one
ignores
the
diﬀerence
between
abelian
and
nonabelian),
like
the
étale
cohomology
of
X,
an
important
and
natural
invariant
of
the
étale
site
of
the
variety
X
under
consideration.
If
one
thinks
about
things
in
this
way,
then
one
sees
that
one
may
regard
both
the
mysterious
functor
conjecture
and
the
various
anabelian
conjectures16)
(such
as
(GC2))
as
asserting
that
some
sort
of
“comparison
theorem”
—
which
realizes
the
philosophy
“Algebro-Geometric
Structure
⇐⇒
Étale
Topology
+
Galois
Action”
—
holds.
Let
us
remark,
however,
that
although
there
is
this
general
sort
of
“categorical
similarity”
between
p-adic
Hodge
theory
and
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture,
the
gap
between
“abelian”
and
“nonabelian/anabelian”
is
highly
nontrivial.
Bridging
this
gap
was
thus
a
major
technical
obstacle
that
had
to
be
surmounted
in
order
to
prove
Theorem
5.1.
§5.
The
Grothendieck
Conjecture
over
Local
Fields
§5.1.
The
Main
Theorem
In
the
following,
we
shall
ﬁx
a
prime
number
p,
and
we
shall
refer
to
any
ﬁeld
which
may
be
realized
as
a
subﬁeld
of
a
ﬁnitely
generated
extension
ﬁeld
of
Qp
as
a
“sub-p-adic
ﬁeld.”
Typical
examples
of
sub-p-adic
ﬁelds
are
ﬁnitely
generated
extension
ﬁelds
of
Q
or
Qp
,
as
well
as
(for
each
positive
integer
N
)
the
ﬁeld
obtained
by
taking
the
composite
(in
some
algebraic
closure
of
Q)
of
all
degree
N
extension
ﬁelds
of
the
rational
number
ﬁeld
Q.
(Note
that
this
last
example
will,
in
general,
be
an
inﬁnite
algebraic
extension
of
Q.)
Mochizuki’s
main
result
([M3])
is
the
following
theorem:
Theorem
5.1.
For
any
smooth
algebraic
variety
S
and
any
hyperbolic
curve
X
(both)
over
a
sub-p-adic
ﬁeld
K,
the
natural
maps
open
Homdom
K
(S,
X)
→
HomGal(K)
(π1
(S),
π1
(X))
(p)
(p)
→
Homopen
Gal(K)
(π1
(S),
π1
(X))
are
bijections.
Here,
Homdom
denotes
the
“set
of
all
dominant
K-morphisms”;
Homopen
K
Gal(K)
denotes
the
“set
of
all
equivalent
classes
(relative
to
the
action
from
the
right
of
conjugation
by
π1
(XK
))
of
open
homomorphisms
which
are
compatible
with
the
projection
to
(p)
Gal(K)”;
and
π1
(V
)
is
the
natural
pro-p
analogue
of
π1
(V
),
i.e.,
the
quotient
of
π1
(V
)
by
(p)
Ker(π1
(VK
)
→
π1
(VK
)).
This
theorem
resolves
conjecture
(GC2)
in
a
fairly
strong
form.
In
terms
of
the
analogy
with
uniformization
theory
discussed
in
§4.2,
the
left-hand
side
is
the
set
of
S-valued
points
of
X,
i.e.,
the
“physical
entity”
of
the
algebraic
curve
X,
while
the
right-hand
side
is
the
set
of
“points”
which
arise
directly
from
the
“analytic
object”
consisting
of
the
geometric
fundamental
group
equipped
with
a
certain
arithmetic
structure
(i.e.,
the
outer
Galois
action).
In
other
words,
just
as
in
the
case
of
the
uniformization
theory
of
Riemann
surfaces,
Theorem
THE
GROTHENDIECK
CONJECTURE
17
5.1
asserts
the
equivalence
of
the
physical
entity
deﬁned
by
the
hyperbolic
algebraic
curve
and
the
analytic
geometric
object
arising
directly
from
the
geometric
fundamental
group
equipped
with
its
arithmetic
structure.
Moreover,
as
a
corollary
of
a
slight
generalization
(=
Theorem
A
of
[M3])
of
Theorem
5.1,
one
has
the
following
birational
version
of
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture:
Corollary
5.2.
For
regular
function
ﬁelds
L
and
M
of
arbitrary
dimension
over
a
ﬁeld
of
constants
K
which
is
sub-p-adic,
the
natural
map
HomK
(M,
L)
→
Homopen
Gal(K)
(Gal(L),
Gal(M
))
is
bijective.
Here,
HomK
denotes
the
“set
of
ring
homomorphisms
over
K”;
and
open
HomGal(K)
denotes
the
“set
of
equivalence
classes
(relative
to
the
action
from
the
right
of
conjugation
by
Gal(M
⊗K
K))
of
open
homomorphisms
which
are
compatible
with
the
projection
to
Gal(K).”
When
the
base
ﬁeld
K
is
ﬁnitely
generated
over
the
rational
number
ﬁeld,
F.

an
isomorphism
version
of
this
result
prior
to
[M3]
using
a
completely
diﬀerent
method
([P2]).
Remarks.
(i)
Theorem
5.1
is
stated
as
a
result
concerning
varieties
and
hyperbolic
curves
over
a
ﬁeld
K,
but
in
fact,
a
similar
theorem
to
Theorem
5.1
holds
if
one
takes
for
one’s
base
any
smooth
algebraic
variety
over
a
sub-p-adic
ﬁeld
(i.e.,
as
opposed
to
just
a
sub-p-adic
ﬁeld,
as
in
Theorem
5.1),
and
then
lets
S
and
X
be
smooth
families
over
B
of
algebraic
varieties
and
hyperbolic
curves,
respectively.
In
fact,
such
a
result
follows
immediately
(by
observing
that
the
function
ﬁeld
of
such
a
B
is
again
a
sub-p-adic
ﬁeld)
from
Theorem
5.1.
(ii)
Another
consequence
of
Theorem
5.1
is
an
isomorphism
version
of
(GC2)
for
algebraic
surfaces
that
may
be
obtained
as
the
total
space
of
a
smooth
family
of
hyperbolic
curves
over
a
base
space
which
is
itself
a
hyperbolic
curve.
For
more
details,
we
refer
to
[M4].
§5.2.
Sketch
of
the
Proof
of
Theorem
5.1
Let
us
continue
this
discussion
by
restricting
to
the
most
essential
case,
where
the
base
ﬁeld
K
is
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
.
Moreover,
for
simplicity,
let
us
assume
that
X
and
S
are
proper,
non-hyperelliptic
hyperbolic
curves.
Indeed,
these
various
conditions
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
essence
of
the
proof,
so
the
general
case
may
be
reduced
immediately
to
the
case
which
one
assumes
that
these
conditions
hold.
Finally,
in
Theorem
5.1,
a
total
three
Hom’s
appear,
but
we
shall
concentrate
on
the
map
between
the
ﬁrst
and
third
Hom’s,
since
it
is
the
most
essential
of
the
various
maps
that
appear.
The
problem
then
is
how
to
reconstruct
X
from

First,
we
let
T
=

Thus,
if
X
is
a
curve
of

then
T
is
a

Zp

of

2g,
which
also

a

Now
as
a

of
the
oldest
part
of
“p-adic

which,
in
fact,
goes
back
to
Tate,
if
we
denote
the

by

,
then
we
have
a

and
the
right-hand
side
is
the
g-dimensional
K-vector
space
consisting
of
all
the
everywhere-regular
diﬀerentials
on
X.
Next,
if
we
denote
the
projective
space
deﬁned
by
DX
by
the
notation
PX
,
then
one
knows
from
elementary
algebraic
geometry
(by
the
assumption
that
X
is
nonhyperelliptic)
that
X
may
be
canonically
embedded
inside
PX
.
In
another
words,
we
have
already
succeeded
in
recovering
completely
group-theoretically
from
ρX
the
space
PX
,
which
serves
as
a
“canonical
container”
for
our
curve
X.
Thus,
the
problem
that
we
must
solve
is
how
to
recover
group-theoretically
a
certain
special
subvariety
(namely,
X)
of
PX
.
At
this
point,
we
ask
the
reader
to
recall
the
analytic
morphism
φ
:
H
→
PX
which
appeared
in
§4.2.
As
was
discussed
in
detail
in
§4.2,
this
morphism
is
deﬁned
by
constructing
algebraic
diﬀerentials
as
analytic
objects.
Taking
this
as
a
hint,
we
would
like
to
carry
out
an
analogous
(in
some
sense)
construction
in
the
present
p-adic
situation.
Thus,
we
must
determine
what
will
take
the
place
(in
the
p-adic
case)
of
the
upper
half-plane
H.
In
the
proofs
of
[M2]
and
[M3],
the
role
of
the
upper
half-plane
is
played
by
a
certain
ﬁeld
which
is
obtained
by
ﬁrst
completing
the
function
ﬁeld
of
X
at
a
p-adic
valuation
with
certain
“good
properties,”
then
taking
the
maximal
tame
extension
of
this
completion,
and
ﬁnally,
p-adically
completing
this
maximal
tame
extension.
In
the
following,
we
shall
denote
this
ﬁeld17)
by
L.
This
ﬁeld
L
is,
just
like
the
ﬁnite
extensions
of
Qp
,
a
complete
valuation
ﬁeld
equipped
with
a
p-adic
valuation,
but,
unlike
ﬁnite
extensions
of
Qp
,
it
contains
one
“geometric
dimension.”
For
instance,
one
manifestation
of
this
geometric
dimension
is
the
fact
that
the
residue
ﬁeld
of
L
is
the
maximal
separated
extension
of
a
function
ﬁeld
in
one
variable
over
a
ﬁnite
ﬁeld.
Another
important
property
of
L,
which
follows
immediately
from
its
deﬁnition,
is
that
it
admits
a
natural
(tautological)
morphism
ξ
:
Spec(L)
→
X
Yet
another
remarkable
property
of
this
ﬁeld
L
is
that
its
isomorphism
class
does
not
depend
on
the
moduli
of
X.
This
property
is
reminiscent
of
the
fact
that
the
isomorphism
class
(as
a
Riemann
surface)
of
X˜
∼
=
H
does
not
depend
on
the
moduli
of
X
.
One
more
thing
guaranteed
by
the
existence
of
the
geometric
dimension
of
L
is
the
property
that
if
one
pulls
back
(by
ξ)
a
nonzero
diﬀerential
on
X
to
L
to
obtain
a
diﬀerential
on
Spec(L),
then
this
pulled-back
diﬀerential
will
always
be
nonzero.
Thus,
the
operation
of
pulling
back
a
diﬀerential
on
X
to
Spec(L)
is
a
faithful
operation,
and,
in
fact,
one
may
even
regard
this
pulled-back
diﬀerential
as
a
sort
of
“analytic
presentation”
of
the
original
algebraic
diﬀerential.
Relative
to
the
analogy
with
the
complex
analytic
case,
this
operation
corresponds
to
the
operation
of
pulling
back
a
diﬀerential
on
a
compact
(hyperbolic)
Riemann
surface
X
to
the
upper
half-plane
H
∼
=
X˜
(where
it
has
an
“analytic
presentation”).
Now
we
would
like
to
return
to
the
problem
of
reconstructing
X
as
a
subvariety
of
PX
group-theoretically.
As
a
consequence
of
Faltings’
p-adic
Hodge
theory,
any
continuous
ho(p)
momorphism
α
:
Gal(L)
→
π1
(X)
(which
satisﬁes
certain
weak,
group-theoretic
conditions)
deﬁnes
a
morphism
φα
:
Spec(L)
→
PX
over
K.
In
other
words,
for
“analytic
L-rational
points,”
one
obtains
a
p-adic
analytic
morphism
φα
which
is
analogous
to
the
morphism
φ
:
H
→
PX
that
appeared
in
the
complex
THE
GROTHENDIECK
CONJECTURE

analytic
discussion
of
§4.2.
The
problem
then
is
to
determine
what
happens
to
the
image
of
the
morphism
φα
.
For
instance,
if
α
arises18)
from
a
“geometric”
L-rational
point
(i.e.,
element
of
X(L))
like
ξ,
then
the
closure
of
the
scheme-theoretic
image
of
φα
coincides
precisely
with
X.
Thus,
if
we
can
rewrite
the
condition
“α
arises
geometrically”
in
terms
in
which,
among
(p)
the
various
objects
associated
to
X,
only
π1
(X)
→
Gal(K)
appears
explicitly,
then
the
proof
of
Theorem
5.1
will
be
complete.
At
this
point,
we
make
use
of
the
following
argument,
which
was
inspired
by
the
proof
(p)
of
Tamagawa19)
.
The
homomorphism
α
deﬁnes
a
section
αL
:
Gal(L)
→
π1
(XL
)
of
the
(p)
arithmetic
fundamental
group
π1
(XL
)
→
Gal(L)
of
the
curve
XL
obtained
by
base-changing
(p)
X
from
K
to
L.
The
image
Im(αL
)
of
this
section
homomorphism
αL
in
π1
(XL
)
forms
a
(p)
closed
subgroup
of
π1
(XL
)
which
is
isomorphic
to
Gal(L).
Thus,
for
each
open
subgroup
(p)
H
⊆
π1
(XL
)
that
contains
this
image,
we
obtain
a
ﬁnite
étale
cover
Y
H
→
XL
.
Here,
Y
H
is
a
hyperbolic
curve
which
is
geometrically
connected
over
L.
Moreover,
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
“family
of
coverings”
obtained
by
taking
all
the
coverings
{Y
H
→
XL
}
which
arise
in
this
way
depends
on
α.
Thus,
one
can
formulate
the
following
condition
on
the
section
homomorphism
αL
which
arises
from
the
homomorphism
α:
(p)
(∗)
For
every
open
subgroup
H
of
π1
(XL
)
which
contains
Im(αL
),
the
set
of
L-rational
points
Y
H
(L)
of
Y
H
is
nonempty.
Let
us
suppose
that
this
we
know
that
this
condition
holds.
If
one
then
allows
the
open
subgroup
H
to
vary
in
a
suitable
fashion,
then,
since
Y
H
(L)
=
∅,
the
various
points
of
Y
H
(L)
map
down
to
points
of
XL
(L).
On
the
other
hand,
by
applying
the
mod
pN
version
of
[F2],
one
sees
that,
for
each
point
of
XL
(L)
which
arises
in
this
way,
one
can
construct
the
mod
pN
version
of
the
preceding
map
φα
;
moreover,
by
using
these
maps,
one
can
prove
that
the
points
of
XL
(L)
that
arise
in
this
way
necessarily
converge
to
a
certain
speciﬁc
point
x∞
∈
XL
(L).
In
fact,
it
also
(p)
follows
immediately
from
this
construction
that
the
homomorphism
Gal(L)
→
π1
(X)
that
arises
from
this
point
x∞
necessarily
coincides
with
the
original
homomorphism
α.
In
other
words,
we
have
shown
the
geometricity
of
α.
Thus,
in
summary,
if
we
can
just
show
that
the
condition
(∗)
that
we
just
imposed
on
αL
is,
in
fact,
purely
“group-theoretic,”
then
the
proof
of
Theorem
5.1
will
be
complete.
The
problem
now
is
to
ﬁnd
a
“group-theoretic”
criterion
for
the
existence
of
an
L-rational
point
of
Y
H
.
In
the
present
p-adic
context,
this
problem
is
not
amenable
to
a
direct
approach
of
“counting
the
number
of
rational
points”
as
in
the
ﬁnite
ﬁeld
case
treated
by
Tamagawa,
so
one
must
resort
to
the
following
somewhat
less
direct
argument.
That
is
to
say,
instead
of
thinking
about
L-rational
points,
one
must
consider
the
existence
of
line
bundles
(of
degree
prime
to
p)
which
are
rational
over
L.
One
reason
for
this
is
that
line
bundles
deﬁne
Chern
classes,
hence
can
be
regarded
as
classes
in
the
étale
cohomology
of
the
curve
Y
H
;
moreover,
the
étale
cohomology
of
a
hyperbolic
curve
is
naturally
isomorphic
to
the
group
cohomology
of
its
arithmetic
fundamental
group,
hence
is
an
entirely
“group-theoretic”
object.
Thus,
we
see
20
HIROAKI
NAKAMURA,
AKIO
TAMAGAWA,
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
that
the
problem
boils
down
to
giving
a
group-theoretic
characterization
of
those
classes
inside
the
relevant
cohomology
group
that
arise
as
the
Chern
classes
of
line
bundles
of
degree
prime
to
p.
This
problem
may
be
handled20)
by
applying
the
theory
of
the
p-adic
exponential
map
of
[BK].
In
other
words,
unlike
the
case
of
L-rational
points
on
Y
H
,
L-rational
line
bundles
(of
degree
prime
to
p)
admit
a
relatively
straightforward
group-theoretic
existence
criterion.
On
the
other
hand,
one
sees
easily
from
elementary
algebraic
geometry
that
once
one
knows
the
existence
of
an
L-rational
line
bundle
of
degree
prime
to
p
on
Y
H
,
one
can
conclude
the
existence
of
an
L-rational
ample
line
bundle
of
degree
prime
to
p
on
Y
H
.
Thus,
by
writing
this
line
bundle
as
an
eﬀective
divisor
(which
is
étale
over
L),
one
sees
that
Y
H
admits
a
rational
point
over
an
extension
ﬁeld
of
L
whose
degree
(over
L)
is
prime
to
p.
On
the
other
hand,
since
such
an
extension
ﬁeld
is
necessarily
a
tame
extension
of
L,
and
since,
moreover,
L,
by
its
very
deﬁnition,
does
not
have
any
nontrivial
tame
extensions,
we
thus
conclude
that
Y
H
already
admits
a
rational
point
over
L.
In
other
words,
the
existence
criterion
for
a
line
bundle
as
above
is
automatically
also
an
existence
criterion
for
L-rational
points.
Thus,
by
establishing
this
existence
criterion,
we
see
that
we
have
completed
the
proof
of
Theorem
5.1.

A

Recent
work
of
Tamagawa
has
begun
to
illuminate
the
extent
to
which,
in
positive
characteristic,
the
geometric
fundamental
group
depends
quite
essentially
on
the
moduli
of
the
curve
in
question.
See
[H],
as
well
as
§3.3
of
the
present
paper,
for
more
details.

Grothendieck
indicates
that
in
addition
to
hyperbolic
algebraic
curves,
successive
smooth
ﬁbrations
of
such
curves,
as
well
as
moduli
spaces
of
such
curves
should
be
considered
as
candidates
for
anabelian
varieties
(cf.,
e.g.,
[M4]).
Recent
work
suggests
that
as
a
necessary
condition
for
anabelianness,
the
geometric
fundamental
group
should
be
more
like
a
free
group
than
like
a
matrix
group
(see
[IN]).
5)
For
instance,
in
the
case
of
elliptic
curves
without
complex
multiplication,
if
one
combines
various
results
of
Faltings,
one
can
argue
that
in
fact,
there
is
only
one
possibility
(cf.
[N6],
5.4).

If
one
writes
K∞
for
the
ﬁeld
obtained
by
adjoining
all
roots
of
unity
to
the
base
ﬁeld
K,
then
it
is
also
conjectured
that
the
sections
arising
from
K-rational
points
of
X
may
be
characterized
as
those
such
that
the
action
of
α(Gal(K∞
))
on
π1
(XK
)
by
conjugation
does
not
admit
any
nontrivial
ﬁxed
points.

This
suggests
that
Grothendieck
had
in
mind
the
“category-theoretic
ideal”
of
thinking
of
X
as
a
variable
and
reconstructing
the
set
of
X-rational
points
Y
(X)
=
Hom(X,
Y
)
of
Y
from
the
arithmetic
fundamental
group.
The
ﬁrst
person
to
(at
least
partially)
realize
this
ideal
was
Mochizuki
([M3])

cf.

The
fact
that
distinct
rational
points
induce
nonconjugate

homomorphisms
was
THE

shown
by
Grothendieck
([G3])
as
an
application
of
the
Mordell-Weil
Theorem.
As
an
application
of
this
fact,
one
can
show
the
algebro-geometric
analogue
of
the
“Sunada
Conjecture”
of
complex
hyperbolic
geometry
for
certain
hyperbolic
algebraic
varieties
(cf.
[N5],
[N7]
2.2).
Moreover,
Mochizuki
has
derived
a
pro-p
version
of
the
fact
that
“distinct
rational
points
deﬁne
nonconjugate
section
homomorphisms”
from
Theorem
5.1
(cf.

As
far
as
this
is
concerned,
one
has
the
contributions
of
F.Pop
([P1,2])
and
of
Mochizuki
(cf.
§5).
Moreover,
Pop’s
work
—
including
his
method
—
builds
on
the
long
tradition
of
research
on
the
“reconstitution
of
a
number
ﬁeld
from
its
absolute
Galois
group,”
starting
with
the
original
ideas
of
J.
Neukirch
([Ne])
in
the
late
1960’s,
continuing
with
the
work
of

ﬁnally,
culminating
in

with

As
is
implicit
in
the
preface
of
[I1],
Ihara
began,
from
his
own
original
point
of
view,
the
construction
of
a
nonabelian
class
ﬁeld
theory
for
modular
function
ﬁelds
over
ﬁnite
ﬁelds
in
the
1960’s,
and,
by
the
beginning
of
the
1970’s,
had
shown
such
things
as
the
fact
that
among
the
tame
coverings
of
P1λ
−
{0,
1,
∞}
over
Fp2
,
those
which
are
controlled
by
the
(congruence)
subgroups
of
SL2
(Z[
1p
])
may
be
characterized
by
the
arithmetic
condition
of
“complete
decomposition
of
the
set
of
supersingular
λ-primes.”
This
sort
of
research
concerning
the
deep
arithmeticity
contained
in
the
fundamental
group
of
the
projective
line
minus
three
points
was
spawn
from
Ihara’s
original
(nonabelian)
class
ﬁeld
theory
point
of
view,
hence
is
of
a
completely
diﬀerent
origin
from
Grothendieck’s
motivation
(discussed
in
§1.1)
for
constructing
an
“algebro-geometric
Galois
theory.”
Moreover,
the
paper
of
Deligne
contained
in
[2]
deals
with
the
issue
of
making
the
fundamental
group
of
the
projective
line
minus
three
points
into
a
unipotent
algebraic
group
in
the
context
of
the
philosophy
of
motives;
this
approach
may
also
be
said
to
be
of
a
distinct
origin
from
those
of
Grothendieck
and
Ihara.

For
the
progress
that
occurred
during
this
period,
we

mainly
to

as

Here,
we
shall
refer
to
the

arising
from
the
action
of
the

group
on
the
roots
of
unity
simply
as
the
“cyclotomic

and
we
shall
call
the
tensor
product
representation
of
this
representation
with
the
permutation
representation
on
the
set
of
cuspidal
points
as
the
“cyclotomic

This

has
only
ﬁnitely
many
rational
points.
It
was
proven
by
Faltings
in
the
same
paper
as
the
one
in
which
the
Tate
Conjecture
was
proven
([F1]).
15)
In
fact,
another
aﬃrmative
answer
to
this
question,
albeit
of
a
somewhat
diﬀerent
nature,
has
also
been
obtained
(cf.
[M5-8]
for
more
details).
16)
In
fact,
the
existence
of
the
mysterious
functor
was
also
predicted
by
none
other
than
Grothendieck
himself.
On
the
other
hand,
as
far
as
the
relationship
between
these
two
conjectures
is
concerned,
there
is
no
record
that
Grothendieck
recognized
—
the
general
similarity
in
form
of
the
two
conjectures
notwithstanding
—
that
this
relationship
was
so
close
as
to

HIROAKI
NAKAMURA,

TAMAGAWA,
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
give
rise
to
a
proof
of
the
sort
that
will
be
discussed
in
§5.2.
Concerning
the
circumstances
surrounding
this
state
of
aﬀairs,
we
refer
to
the
discussion
of
§4.1.
17)
In
fact,
if
one
takes
this
as
the
deﬁnition
of
L,
the
following
argument
becomes
slightly
inaccurate,
but
in
the
interest
of
minimizing
the
introduction
of
inessential
technical
details,
we
hope
that
the
reader
will
forgive
this
minor
transgression.
18)
The
phrase
“arises
from
a
geometric
rational
point
Spec(L)
→
X”
means
that
it
arises
(p)
as
the
morphism
Gal(L)
=
π1
(Spec(L))
→
π1
(X)
→
π1
(X)
obtained
by
applying
the
functor
π1
to
some
morphism
Spec(L)
→
X.
