Introduction
In
this
manuscript,
we
give
an
exposition
of
various
ideas
and
results
related
to
the
fundamental
results
of
[Tama1-2],
[Mzk1-2]
concerning
Grothendieck’s
Conjecture
of
Anabelian
Geometry
(which
we
refer
to
as
the
“Grothendieck
Conjecture”
for
short;
cf.
[Mzk2],
Introduction,
for
a
brief
introduction
to
this
conjecture).
Many
of
these
ideas
existed
prior
to
the
publication
of
[Tama1-2],
[Mzk1-2],
but
were

discussed
in
these
papers
because
of
their
rather
elementary
nature
and
secondary
importance
(by
comparison
to
the
main
results
of
these
papers).
Nevertheless,
it
is
the
hope
of
the
author
that
the
reader
will
ﬁnd
the
present
manuscript
useful
as
a
supplement
to
[Tama1-2],
[Mzk1-2].
In
particular,
we
hope
that
the
discussion
of
the
present
manuscript
will
serve
to
clarify
the
meaning
and
motivation
behind
the
main
result
of
[Mzk2].
Our
main
results
are
the
following:
(1)
In
§1,
we
take
the
reverse
point
of
view
to
the
usual
one
(i.e.,
that
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
should
be
regarded
as
a
sort
of
(anabelian)
Tate
Conjecture)
and
show
that
in
a
certain
case,
the
Tate
Conjecture
may
be
regarded
as
a
sort
of
Grothendieck
Conjecture
(cf.
Theorem
1.1,
Corollary
1.2).
In
particular,
Corollary
1.2
is
interesting
in
that
it
allows
one
to
express
the
fundamental
phenomenon
involved
in
the
Tate
and
Grothendieck
Conjectures
using
elementary
language
that
can,
in
principle,
be
understood
even
by
high
school
students
(cf.
the
Introduction
to
§1;
the
Remarks
following
Corollary
1.2).
(2)
In
§2,
we
show
how
the
main
result
of
[Mzk2]
gives
rise
to
a
purely
algebro-geometric
corollary
(i.e.,
one
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
Galois
groups,
arithmetic
considerations,
etc.)
in
characteristic
0
(cf.
Corollary
2.1).
Moreover,
we
give
a
partial
generalization
of
this
result
to
positive
characteristic
(cf.
Theorem
2.2).
(3)
In
§3,
we
discuss
real
analogues
of
anabelian
geometry.
Not
surprisingly,
the
real
case
is
substantially
easier
than
the
case
where
the
base
ﬁeld
is
p-adic
or
a
number
ﬁeld.
Thus,
we
are
able
to
prove
much
stronger
results
in
the
real
case
than
in
the
p-adic
or
number
ﬁeld
cases
(cf.
Theorem
3.6,
Corollaries
3.7,
3.8,
3.10,
3.11,
3.13,
3.14,
3.15).
In
particular,
we
are
able
to
prove
various
real
analogues
of
the
so-called
Section
Conjecture
of
anabelian
geometry
(which
has
not
been
proven,
at
the
time
of
writing,
for
any
varieties
over
p-adic
or
number
ﬁelds)
—
cf.
[Groth],
p.
289,
(2);
[NTM],
§1.2,
(GC3),
for
a
discussion
of
the
Section
Conjecture.
Also,
we
note
that
the
real
case
is
interesting
relative
to
the
analogy
between
the
diﬀerential
geometry
that
occurs
in
the
real
case
and
certain
aspects
of
the
p-adic
case
(cf.
[Mzk4],
Introduction,
§0.10;
the
Introduction
to
§3
of
the
present
manuscript).
It
was
this
analogy
that
led
the
author
to
the
proof
of
the
main
result
of
[Mzk2].
(4)
In
§4,
we
show
that
a
certain
isomorphism
version
(cf.
Theorem
4.12)
of
the
main
result
of
[Mzk2]
can
be
proven
over
“generalized
sub-p-adic
ﬁelds”
(cf.
Deﬁnition
4.11),
which
form
a
somewhat
larger
class
of
ﬁelds
than
the
class
of
“sub-p-adic
ﬁelds”
dealt
with
in
[Mzk2].
This
result
is
interesting
in
that
it
is
reminiscent
of
the
main
results
of
[Tama2],
as
well
as
of
the
rigidity
theorem
of
Mostow-Prasad
for
hyperbolic
manifolds
of
real
dimension
3
(cf.
the
Remarks
following
the
proof
of
Theorem
4.12).

Although
we
believe
the
results
of
§4
to
be
essentially
new,
we
make
no
claim
of
essential
originality
relative
to
the
results
of
§1,
2,
3,
which
may
be
proven
using
well-known
standard
techniques.
Nevertheless,
we
believe
that
it
is
likely
that,
even
with
respect
to
§1,
2,
3,
the
point
of
view
of
the
discussion
is
likely
to
be
new
(and
of
interest
relative
to
understanding
the
main
result
of
[Mzk2]).
Finally,
before
beginning
our
exposition,
we
pause
to
review
the
main
result
of
[Mzk2]
(which
is
the
central
result
to
which
the
ideas
of
the
present
manuscript
are
related).
To
do
this,
we
must
introduce
some
notation.
Let
Σ
be
a
nonempty
set
of
prime
numbers.
If
K
is
a
ﬁeld,
then
let
us
denote
its
absolute
Galois
group
Gal(K/K)
(where
K
is
some
algebraic
closure
of
K)
by
ΓK
.
If
X
is
a
geometrically
connected
K-scheme,
then
let
us
recall
that
its
algebraic
fundamental
group
π1
(X)
(for
some
choice
of
base-point)
ﬁts
into
a
natural
exact
sequence
1
→
π1
(X
⊗K
K)
→
π(X)
→
ΓK
→
1
Let
us
denote
by
ΔX
the
maximal
pro-Σ
quotient
of
π1
(X
⊗K
K)
(i.e.,
the
inverse
limit
of
those
ﬁnite
quotients
whose
orders
are
products
of
primes
contained
in
Σ).
The
proﬁnite
group
ΔX
is
often
referred
to
as
the
(pro-Σ)
geometric
fundamental
group
of
X.
Note
that
since
the
kernel
of
π1
(X
⊗K
K)
→
ΔX
is
a
characteristic
subgroup
of
π1
(X
⊗K
K),
it
follows
that
it
is
normal
inside
π1
(X).
Denote
the
quotient
of
π1
(X)
by
this
normal
subgroup
by
ΠX
.
The
proﬁnite
group
ΠX
is
often
referred
to
as
the
(pro-Σ)
arithmetic
fundamental
group
of
X.
(When
it
is
Σ
necessary
to
specify
the
set
of
primes
Σ,
we
will
write
ΔΣ
X
,
ΠX
.)
Thus,
we
have
a
natural
exact
sequence
1
→
ΔX
→
ΠX
→
ΓK
→
1
In
[Mzk2],
the
author
proved
the
following
result:
Theorem
A.
Let
K
be
a
sub-p-adic
ﬁeld
(i.e.,
a
ﬁeld
isomorphic
to
a
subﬁeld
of
a
ﬁnitely
generated
ﬁeld
extension
of
Qp),
where
p
∈
Σ.
Let
XK
be
a
smooth
variety
over
K,
and
YK
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
K.
Let
Homdom
K
(XK
,
YK
)
be
the
open
set
of
dominant
K-morphisms
from
XK
to
YK
.
Let
HomΓK
(ΠX
,
ΠY
)
be
the
set
of
open,
continuous
group
homomorphisms
ΠX
→
ΠY
over
ΓK
,
considered
up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
arising
from
ΔY
.
Then
the
natural
map
open
Homdom
K
(XK
,
YK
)
→
HomΓK
(ΠX
,
ΠY
)
is
bijective.
Remark.
Theorem
A
as
stated
above
is
a
formal
consequence
of
“Theorem
A”
of
[Mzk2].
In
[Mzk2],
only
the
cases
of
Σ
=
{p},
and
Σ
equal
to
the
set
of
all
prime
numbers
are
discussed,
but
it
is
easy
to
see
that
the
case
of
arbitrary
Σ
containing
p
may
be
derived
from
the
case
Σ
=
{p}
by
precisely
the
same
argument
as
that
4
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
used
in
[Mzk2]
(cf.
[Mzk2],
the
Remark
following
Theorem
16.5)
to
derive
the
case
of
Σ
equal
to
the
set
of
all
prime
numbers
from
the
case
of
Σ
=
{p}.

Section
1:
The
Tate
Conjecture
as
a
Sort
of
Grothendieck
Conjecture
In
this
§,
we
attempt
to
present
what
might
be
referred
to
as
the
most
fundamental
“prototype
result”
among
the
family
of
results
(including
the
Tate
and
Grothendieck
Conjectures)
that
states
that
maps
between
varieties
are
“essentially
equivalent”
to
maps
between
arithmetic
fundamental
groups.
The
result
given
below,
especially
in
the
form
Corollary
1.2,
is
interesting
in
that
it
allows
one
to
express
the
fundamental
phenomenon
involved
using
elementary
language
that
can,
in
principle,
be
understood
even
by
high
school
students
(cf.
the
Remark
following
Corollary
1.2).
In
particular,
it
does
not
require
a
knowledge
of
the
notion
of
a
Galois
group
or
any
another
advanced
notions,
hence
provides
a
convincing
example
of
how
advanced
mathematics
can
be
applied
to
prove
results
which
can
be
stated
in
simple
terms.
Also,
it
may
be
useful
for
explaining
to
mathematicians
in
other
ﬁelds
(who
may
not
be
familiar
with
Galois
groups
or
other
notions
used
in
arithmetic
geometry)
the
essence
of
the
Tate
and
Grothendieck
Conjectures.
Another
interesting
feature
of
Corollary
1.2
is
that
it
shows
how
the
Tate
conjecture
may
be
thought
of
as
being
of
the
“same
genre”
as
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
in
that
it
expresses
how
the
isomorphism
class
of
a
curve
(in
this
case,
an
elliptic
curve)
may
be
recovered
from
Galois-theoretic
information.
§1.1.
The
Tate
Conjecture
for
non-CM
Elliptic
Curves
Let
K
be
a
number
ﬁeld
(i.e.,
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Q).
If
E
is
an
elliptic
curve
over
K,
and
N
is
a
natural
number,
then
let
us
write
K(E[N
])
for
the
minimal
ﬁnite
extension
ﬁeld
of
K
over
which
all
of
the
N
-torsion
points
are
deﬁned.
Note
that
the
extension
K(E[N
])
will
always
be
Galois.
Then
we
have
the
following
elementary
consequence
of
the
“Tate
Conjecture
for
abelian
varieties
over
number
ﬁelds”
proven
in
[Falt]:
TOPICS

ANABELIAN

Theorem
1.1.
Let
K
be
a
number
ﬁeld.
Let
E1
and
E2
be
elliptic
curves
over
K
such
that
neither
E1
nor
E2
admits
complex
multiplication
over
Q.
Then
E1
and
E2
are
isomorphic
as
elliptic
curves
over
K
if
and
only
if
K(E1
[N
])
=
K(E2
[N
])
for
all
natural
numbers
N
.
Remark.
Note
that
the
expression
“K(E1
[N
])
=
K(E2
[N
])”
is
to
be
understood
to
mean
“equal
as
subﬁelds
of
some
ﬁxed
algebraic
closure
of
K.”
Moreover,
the
substance
of
this
expression
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
algebraic
closure
precisely
because
both
ﬁelds
in
question
are
Galois
extensions
of
K.
Proof.
If
E1
∼
=
E2
over
K,
then
it
is
clear
that
K(E1
[N
])
=
K(E2
[N
])
for
all
natural
numbers
N
.
Thus,
let
us
assume
that
K(E1
[N
])
=
K(E2
[N
])
for
all
natural
numbers
N
,
and
prove
that
E1
∼
=
E2
over
K.
In
this
proof,
we
use
the
notation
and
results
of
§1.2
below.
Since
we
assume
that
K(E1
[N
])
=
K(E2
[N
]),
let
us
denote
this
ﬁeld
by
K[N
].
Also,
if
p
is
a
prime
number,
then
let
us
write
K[p∞
]
for
the
union
of
the
K[pn],
as
n
ranges
over
the
positive
integers.
Finally,
for
n
≥
0,
we
denote
the
Galois
group
Gal(K[p∞
]/K[pn])
by
Γ[pn
];
the
center
of
Γ[pn
]
by
ZΓ[pn];
and
the
quotient
Γ[pn
]/ZΓ[pn
]
by
P
Γ[pn
].
Let
p
be
a
prime
number.
Then
by
the
semisimplicity
of
the
Tate
module,
together
with
the
Tate
conjecture
(both
proven
in
general
in
[Falt];
cf.
also
[Ser2],
IV),
the
fact
that
neither
E1
nor
E2
admits
complex
multiplication
over
Q
implies
that
there
exists
an
integer
n
≥
1
such
that
the
Galois
representation
on
the
ppower
torsion
points
of
E1
(respectively,
E2
)
induces
an
isomorphism
β1
:
Γ[pn
]
∼
=
[n]
[n]
[n]
n
∼
GL2
(Zp
)
(respectively,
β2
:
Γ[p
]
=
GL2
(Zp
)),
where
GL2
(Zp
)
⊆
GL2
(Zp
)
is
[n]
the
subgroup
of
matrices
that
are
≡
1
modulo
pn
.
Since
the
kernel
of
GL2
(Zp
)
→
[n]
[n]
P
GL2
(Zp
)
is
easily
seen
to
be
equal
to
the
center
of
GL2
(Zp
),
it
thus
follows
that
β1
,
β2
induce
isomorphisms
[n]
α1
:
P
Γ[pn
]
∼
=
P
GL2
(Zp
);
[n]
α2
:
P
Γ[pn
]
∼
=
P
GL2
(Zp
)
Thus,
in
particular,
by
Lemma
1.3
of
§1.2
below,
we
obtain
that
(after
possibly
def
[n]
increasing
n)
the
automorphism
α
=
α1
◦
α−1
of
P
GL2
(Zp
)
is
deﬁned
by
con2
jugation
by
an
element
of
P
GL2
(Zp
).
In
particular,
we
obtain
that
there
exists
a
Zp
-linear
isomorphism
ψ
:
Tp
(E1
)
∼
=
Tp
(E2
)
between
the
p-adic
Tate
modules
of
E1
and
E2
with
the
property
that
for
σ
∈
Γ[pn
],
we
have
ψ(σ(t))
=
λσ
σ(ψ(t))
(∀t
∈
Tp
(E1
)),
for
some
λσ
∈
Zp
×
which
is
independent
of
t.
On
the
other
hand,
since
the
determinant
of
ψ
is
clearly
compatible
with
the
Galois
actions
on
both
sides
(given
by
the
cyclotomic
character),
it
thus
follows
(by
taking
determinants
of
both
sides
of
the
equation
ψ(σ(t))
=
λσ
σ(ψ(t)))
that
λ2σ
=
1.
Since
the
correspondence
σ
→
λσ
is
clearly
a
homomorphism
(hence
a
character
of
order
2),
we
thus
obtain
that:
6

since
HK

=

(E1

E2

(the

of
homomorphisms

is
a
ﬁnitely

free
Z-module
of

≤

(since
E1

do
not
have
complex

over

we
thus
obtain
that

a

Let

corresponds

Now
write
HK
=
HomK
(E1
,
E2
).
Then
the
above
argument
shows
that
HK
is
a
free
Z-module
of
rank
1
with
a
generator

that
induces
an
isomorphism
on
p-power
torsion
points
for
every
prime
number
p.
But
this
implies
that

:
(E1
)K
→
(E2
)K
is
an
isomorphism,
i.e.,
that
E1
and
E2
become
isomorphic
over
K.
Thus,
it
remains
to
check
that
E1
and
E2
are,
in
fact,
isomorphic
over
K.
Let
p
≥
5
be
a
prime
number
which
is
suﬃciently
large
that:
(i)
K
is
absolutely
unramiﬁed
at
p;
(ii)
the
Galois
representations
on
the
p-power
torsion
points
of
E1
and
E2
induce
isomorphisms
β1
:
Γ[p0
]
∼
=
GL2
(Zp
);
β2
:
Γ[p0
]
∼
=
GL2
(Zp
)
(the
existence
of
such
p
follows
from
the
“modulo
l
versions”
(for
large
l)
of
the
semisimplicity
of
the
Tate
module,
together
with
the
Tate
conjecture
in
[Mord],
VIII,
§5
;
cf.
also
[Ser2],
IV).
Now
we
would
like
to
consider
the
extent
to
which
the
automorphism
β
=
β1
◦β2−1
of
GL2
(Zp
)
is
deﬁned
by
conjugation
by
an
element
of
GL2
(Zp
).
Note
that
by
what
we
did
above,
we
know
that
the
morphism
induced
[n]
by
β
on
P
GL2
(Zp
)
(for
some
large
n)
is
given
by
conjugation
by
some
element
A
∈
GL2
(Zp
).
Let
γ
:
GL2
(Zp
)
→
GL2
(Zp
)
be
the
automorphism
of
GL2
(Zp
)
obtained
by
composing
β
with
the
automorphism
given
by
conjugation
by
A−1
.
[n]
Thus,
γ
induces
the
identity
on
P
GL2
(Zp
).
But
this
implies
(by
Lemma
1.4
below)
that
γ
induces
the
identity
on
P
GL2
(Zp
).
In
particular,
it
follows
that
there
exists
a
homomorphism
λ
:
GL2
(Zp
)
→
Zp
×
such
that
γ(σ)
=
λ(σ)
·
σ
(∀σ
∈
GL2
(Zp
)).
Next,
let
us
recall
that
since
p
≥
5,
the
topological
group
SL2(Zp
)
has
no
abelian
quotients
(an
easy
exercise).
Thus,
λ
factors
through
the
determinant
map
GL2
(Zp
)
→
Zp
×
.
Moreover,
(cf.
the
argument
at
the
beginning
of
the
proof
involving
arbitrary
p)
since
the
composites
of
β1
,
β2
with
the
determinant
map
are
given
by
the
cyclotomic
character,
we
obtain
that
λ2
=
1.
In
particular,
we
obtain
that
λ
is
trivial
on
the
index
2
subgroup
of
GL2
(Zp
)
of
elements
whose
determinant
is
a
square.
Put
another
way,
if
we
write
Kp
for
the
quadratic
extension
of
K
determined
by
composing
the
cyclotomic
character
Gal(K/K)
→
Zp
×
(which
is
surjective
since
K
is
absolutely
unramiﬁed
at
p)
with
the
unique
surjection
Zp
×

def
TOPICS

Z/2Z,
then
over
Kp
,
the
Tate
modules
Tp
(E1
),
Tp
(E2
)
become
isomorphic
as
Galois
modules,
which
implies
that
HomKp
(E1
,
E2
)
=
0.
But
this
implies
that
E1
and
E2
become
isomorphic
over
Kp
.
On
the
other
hand,
for
distinct
primes
p,
p
as
above,
Kp
,
Kp
form
linearly
disjoint
quadratic
extensions
of
K
(as
can
be
seen
by
considering
the
ramiﬁcation
at
p,
p
).
Thus,
the
fact
that
both
Gal(K/Kp
)
and
Gal(K/Kp
)
act
trivially
on
HomK
(E1
,
E2
)
implies
that
Gal(K/K)
acts
trivially
on
HomK
(E1
,
E2
),
so
E1
∼
=
E2
over
K,
as
desired.

Remark.
Note
that
in
the
above
proof
(cf.
also
the
arguments
of
§1.2
below),
we
use
in
an
essential
way
the
strong
rigidity
properties
of
the
simple
p-adic
Lie
group
P
GL2
(Zp
).
Such
rigidity
properties
are
not
shared
by
abelian
Lie
groups
such
as
Zp
;
this
is
why
it
was
necessary
to
assume
in
Theorem
1.1
that
the
elliptic
curves
in
question
do
not
admit
complex
multiplication.
Corollary
1.2.
There
is
a
ﬁnite
set
CM
⊆
Z
such
that
if
E1
and
E2
are
arbitrary
elliptic
curves
over
Q
whose
j-invariants
j(E1
),
j(E2
)
do
not
belong
to
CM,
then
E1
and
E2
are
isomorphic
as
elliptic
curves
over
Q
if
and
only
if
Q(E1
[N
])
=
Q(E2
[N
])
for
all
natural
numbers
N
.
Proof.
In
light
of
Theorem
1.1,
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
there
are
only
ﬁnitely
many
possibilities
(all
of
which
are
integral
—
cf.,
e.g.,
[Shi],
p.
108,
Theorem
4.4)
for
the
j-invariant
of
an
elliptic
curve
over
Q
which
has
complex
multiplication
over
Q.
But
this
follows
from
the
ﬁniteness
of
the
number
of
imaginary
quadratic
extensions
of
Q
with
class
number
one
(cf.,
e.g.,
[Stk]),
together
with
the
theory
of
[Shi]
(cf.
[Shi],
p.
123,
Theorem
5.7,
(i),
(ii)).
(Note
that
we
also
use
here
the
elementary
facts
that:
(i)
the
class
group
of
any
order
surjects
onto
the
class
group
of
the
maximal
order;
(ii)
in
a
given
imaginary
quadratic
extension
of
Q,
there
are
only
ﬁnitely
many

with

constructs

to
mean
“being

up

then
Corollary

may
be
expressed
as

Except

case
of

two
elliptic

E2

the

“subﬁeld

—
i.e.,
“collection
of

closed
under

subtraction,
multiplication,
and

—
as
the
coordinates
necessary

(where,
of
course,
the

is
deﬁned

Some
Pro-p
Group
Theory
Let
n
≥
1
be
an
integer.
In
this
§,
let
us
denote
by
P
GL2
the
algebraic
group
(deﬁned
over
Z)
obtained
by
forming
the
quotient
of
GL2
by
Gm
(where
Gm
→
GL2
is
the
standard
embedding
by
scalars),
and
by
TOPICS

[n]
P
GL2
(Zp
)
⊆
P
GL2
(Zp
)
the
subgroup
of
elements
which
are
≡
1
modulo
pn
.
Let
us
write
pgl2
(Zp
)
for
the
quotient
of
the
Lie
algebra
M2
(Zp
)
(of
2
by
2
matrices
with
Zp
coeﬃcients)
by
the
scalars
Zp
⊆
M2
(Zp
).
Thus,
pgl2
(Zp
)
⊆
pgl2
(Zp
)
⊗Zp
Qp
=
pgl2
(Qp
).
Write
[n]
pgl2
(Zp

⊆
pgl2
(Zp
)
for
the
submodule
which
is
the
image
of
matrices
in
M2
(Zp
)
[n]
which
are
≡
0
modulo
pn
.
Thus,
for
n
suﬃciently
large,
pgl2
(Zp
)
maps
bijectively
[n]
onto
P
GL2
(Zp
)
via
the
exponential
map
(cf.

V,
§7).

Lemma
1.3.
Let
α
:
P
GL2
(Zp

→
P
GL2
(Zp
)
be
an
automorphism
of
the
[n]
[m]
[m]
proﬁnite
topological
group
P
GL2
(Zp
)
such
that
α(P
GL2

=
P

(Zp

for
all
m
≥
n.
Then
there
exists
an
element
A
∈
P
GL2
(Zp
)
such
that
for
some
m
≥
n,
the
restriction
α|P
GL[m]
(Zp
)
is
given
by
conjugation
by
A.
2
Proof.
Let
us
write
A
:
pgl2
(Qp
)
→
pgl2
(Qp
)
for
the
morphism
on
Lie
algebras
induced
by
α.
By
[Ser1],
Chapter
V,
§7,
9,
after
possibly
replacing
n
by
a
larger
n,
we
may
assume
that
α
is
the
homomorphism
obtained
by
exponentiating
A.
Moreover,
by
the
well-known
theory
of
the
Lie
algebra
pgl2
(Qp
),
it
follows
that
A
may
be
obtained
by
conjugating
by
some
A
∈
P
GL2
(Qp
).
(Indeed,
this
may
be
proven
by
noting
that
A
induces
an
automorphism
of
the
“variety
of
Borel
subalgebras
of
pgl2
(Qp
).”
Since
this
variety
is
simply
P1Qp
,
we
thus
get
an
automorphism
of
P1Qp
,
hence
an
element
of
P
GL2
(Qp
),
as
desired.)
On
the
other
hand,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
structure
theory
of
ﬁnitely
generated
Zp
-modules
that
A
may
be
written
as
a
product
A
=
C1
·
A
·
C2

where
C1
,
C2
∈
P
GL2
(Zp
),
and
A
is
deﬁned
by
a
matrix
of
the
form
where
λ1
,
λ2
∈
Qp
×
.
λ1
0
0
λ2

,
[n]
Now
observe
that
the
fact
that
A
arises
from
an
automorphism
of
P
GL2
(Zp
)
[n]
implies
that
A
induces
an
automorphism
of
pgl2
(Zp
)
(cf.
the
discussion
at
the
beginning
of
this
§).
Since
conjugation
by
C1
and
C2
clearly
induces
automorphisms
[n]
of
pgl2
(Zp
),
it
thus
follows
that
conjugation
by
A
induces
an
automorphism
of
[n]
pgl2
(Zp
).
Now,
by
considering,
for
instance,
upper
triangular
matrices
with
zeroes
[n]
along
the
diagonal,
one
sees
that
A
can
only
induce
an
automorphism
of
pgl2
(Zp
)

if
λ1
=
λ2
·
u,
where
u
∈
Zp
×
.
Let
A
=

·
A
.
Then
clearly
A
∈
P
GL2
(Zp
),
def
10

and
conjugation
by
A
induces
A.
Thus,
by
using
the
exponential
map,
we
obtain
that
for
some
m
≥
n,
the
restriction
α|P
GL[m]
(Z

is
given
by
conjugation
by
A,
as

desired.

The
following
lemma
was
pointed
out
to
the
author
by
A.
Tamagawa:
Lemma
1.4.
Let
α
:
P
GL2
(Zp
)
→
P
GL2
(Zp
)
be
an
automorphism
of
the
proﬁnite
topological
group
P
GL2
(Zp
)
such
that
for
some
integer
m
≥
1,
the
restriction
α|P
GL[m]
(Z
)
is
the
identity.
Then
α
itself
is
the
identity.
2
p
Proof.
First
let
us
show
that


α
is
the
identity
on
the
image
in
P
GL2
(Zp
)
of
1
λ
matrices
of
the
form
(where
λ
∈
Zp
).
For
m
≥
0
an
integer,
write
0
1
Um
⊆
P
GL2
(Zp
)
for
the
subgroup
of
images
in
P
GL2
(Zp
)
of
matrices
of
the
form

1
λ
0

1
where
λ
∈
pm
·Zp
.
Since,
by
hypothesis,
α
preserves
Um
for
some
m,
it
follows
that
α
preserves
the
centralizer
Z(Um
)
of
Um
in
P
GL2
(Zp
).
On
the
other
hand,
one
checks
easily
that
Z(Um
)
=
U0
.
Thus,
α
preserves
U0
,
i.e.,
induces
an
automorphism
of
the
topological
group
U0
∼
=
Zp
which
is
the
identity
on
pm
·
Zp
.
Since
Zp
is
torsion
free,
it
thus
follows
that
α
is
the
identity
on
U0
,
as
desired.
Moreover,
let
us
observe
that
since
conjugation
commutes
with
the
operation
of
taking
centralizers,
one
sees
immediately
that
the
above
argument
implies
also
that
α
is
the
identity
on
all
conjugates
of
U0
in
P
GL2
(Zp
).
Next,
let
us
observe
that
α
is
the
identity
on
the
subgroup
B
⊆
P
GL2
(Zp
)
consisting
of
images
of
matrices
of
the
form:

μ1
λ
0
μ2

(where
λ
∈
Zp
,
μ1
,
μ2
∈
Zp
×
).
Indeed,
since
B
is
generated

by
U0
and
the
subgroup
μ
0
T
⊆
P
GL2
(Zp
)
of
images
of
matrices
of
the
form
,
it
suﬃces
to
see
that
0
1
α
is
the
identity
on
T
.
But
T
acts
faithfully
by
conjugation
on
U0
,
and
α
is
the
identity
on
U0
.
This
implies
that
α
is
the
identity
on
T
,
hence
on
B.
Moreover,
as
in
the
previous
paragraph,
this
argument
implies
that
α
is
the
identity
on
all
conjugates
of
B
in
P
GL2
(Zp
).
Since
P
GL2
(Zp
)
is
generated
by
the
union
of
the
conjugates
of
B,
it
thus
follows
that
α
is
the
identity
on
P
GL2
(Zp
).

In

we

an

(Corollary
2.1)
of
the
main
theorem
of
[Mzk2]
which
is
interesting
in
that
it
is
purely
algebro-geometric,
i.e.,
it
makes
no
mention
of
Galois
actions
or
other

§2.1.
A
Corollary
of
the
Main
Theorem
of
[Mzk2]
In
this
§,
we
ﬁx
a
nonempty
set
of
prime
numbers
Σ,
and
use
the
notation
of
the
discussion
of
Theorem
A
in
the
Introduction.
Now
Theorem
A
has
the
following
immediate
consequence:
Corollary
2.1.
Let
K
be
a
ﬁeld
of
characteristic
0.
Let
C
be
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
K,
and
let
ψ
:
X
→
Y
be
a
morphism
of
(geometrically
integral)
smooth
varieties
over
K
which
induces
an
isomorphism
ΔX
∼
=
ΔY
.
Let
us
write
“Homdom
(−,
C)”
for
the
set
of
dominant
K-morphisms
from
“−”
to
C.
Then
the
K
natural
morphism
of
sets
dom
Homdom
K
(Y,
C)
→
HomK
(X,
C)
induced
by
ψ
:
X
→
Y
is
a
bijection.
Proof.
By
a
standard
technique
involving
the
use
of
subﬁelds
of
K
which
are
ﬁnitely
generated
over
Q,
we
reduce
immediately
to
the
case
where
K
is
ﬁnitely
generated
over
Q.
(We
recall
for
the
convenience
of
the
reader
that
the
essence
of
this
technique
lies
in
the
fact
that
since
we
are
working
with
K-schemes
of
ﬁnite
type,
all
schemes
and
morphisms
between
schemes
are
deﬁned
by
ﬁnitely
many
polynomials
with
coeﬃcients
in
K,
hence
may
be
deﬁned
over
any
subﬁeld
of
K
that
contains
these
coeﬃcients
(of
which
there
are
only
ﬁnitely
many!).)
Next,
observe
that
since
the
morphism
ψ
:
X
→
Y
induces
an
isomorphism
between
the
respective
geometric
fundamental
groups,
it
follows
from
the
exact
sequences
reviewed
in
the
Introduction
that
it
induces
an
isomorphism
ΠX
∼
=
ΠY
.
By
Theorem
A
of
the
Introduction,
it
thus
follows
that
the
morphism
of
sets
under
dom
consideration
—
i.e.,
Homdom
K
(Y,
C)
→
HomK
(X,
C)
—
is
naturally
isomorphic
to
the
morphism
of
sets
given
by
open
Homopen
ΓK
(ΠY
,
ΠC
)
→
HomΓK
(ΠX
,
ΠC
)
which
is
bijective.
This
completes
the
proof.

Remark.
As
stated
above,
Corollary
2.1
is
interesting
in
that
it
is
a
purely
algebrogeometric
application
of
Theorem
A,
i.e.,
it
makes
no
mention
of
Galois
actions
or
other
arithmetic
phenomena.
The
observation
that
Corollary
2.1
holds
ﬁrst
arose
in
discussions
between
the
author
and
A.
Tamagawa.
Typical
examples
of
morphisms
ψ
:
X
→
Y
as
in
Corollary
2.1
are:
12
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
(1)
the
case
where
X
→
Y
is
a
ﬁber
bundle
in,
say,
the
étale
topology,
with
proper,
simply
connected
ﬁbers;
(2)
the
case
where
Y
⊆
Pnk
is
a
closed
subvariety
of
dimension
≥
3
in
some
projective
space,
and
X
is
obtained
by
intersecting
Y
with
a
hyperplane
in
Pnk
.
In
these
cases,
the
fact
that
the
resulting
morphism
on
geometric
fundamental
groups
is
an
isomorphism
follows
from
the
long
exact
homotopy
sequence
of
a
ﬁber
bundle
in
the
ﬁrst
case
(cf.
[SGA1],
X,
Corollary
1.4),
and
Lefshetz-type
theorems
(cf.
[SGA2],
XII,
Corollary
3.5)
in
the
second
case.
Since
this
consequence
of
Theorem
A
(i.e.,
Corollary
2.1)
is
purely
algebro-geometric,
it
is
natural
to
ask
if
one
can
give
a
purely
algebro-geometric
proof
of
Corollary
2.1.
In
§2.2
below,
we
give
a
partial
answer
to
this
question.
§2.2.
A
Partial
Generalization
to
Finite
Characteristic
Let
k
be
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld.
Let
C
be
a
proper
hyperbolic
curve
over
k.
Suppose
that
we
are
also
given
a
connected,
smooth
closed
subvariety
Y
⊆
Pnk
of
projective
space,
of
dimension
≥
3,
together
with
a
hyperplane
H
⊆
Pnk
such

def
that
the
scheme-theoretic
intersection
X
=
H
Y
is
still
smooth.
Note
that
X
is
necessarily
connected
(cf.
[SGA2],
XII,
Corollary
3.5)
and
of
dimension
≥
2.
If
k
is
of
characteristic
p
>
0,
and
S
is
a
k-scheme,
then
let
us
write
ΦS
:
S
→
S
for
the
Frobenius
morphism
on
S
(given
by
raising
regular
functions
on
S
to
the
power
p).
If
k
is
of
characteristic
0,
then
we
make
the
convention
that
ΦS
:
S
→
S
denotes
the
identity
morphism.
If
T
is
a
k-schemes,
then
we
deﬁne
HomΦ
(T,
C)
to
be
the
inductive
limit
of
the
system
Homdom
(T,
C)
→
Homdom
(T,
C)
→
.
.
.
→
Homdom
(T,
C)
→

.
.
k
k
k
(−,
C)
to
the
where
the
arrows
are
those
induced
by
applying
the
functor
Homdom
k
morphism
ΦT
.
Thus,
in
particular,
if
k
is
of
characteristic
0,
then
HomΦ
(T,
C)
=
(T,
C).
Homdom
k
Now
we
have
the
following
partial
generalization
of
Corollary
2.1
of
§2.1
to
the
case
of
varieties
over
a
ﬁeld
of
arbitrary
characteristic:
Theorem
2.2.
Let
k,
C,
X,
and
Y
be
as
above.
Then
the
natural
morphism
HomΦ
(Y,
C)
→
HomΦ
(X,
C)
TOPICS
IN
ANABELIAN
GEOMETRY
13
induced
by
the
inclusion
X
→
Y
is
a
bijection.
Proof.
Let
us
denote
by
AX
,
AY
,
and
AC
the
Albanese
varieties
of
X,
Y
,
and
C,
respectively.
We
refer
to
[Lang],
Chapter
II,
§3,
for
basic
facts
concerning
Albanese
varieties.
Thus,
the
inclusion
X
→
Y
induces
a
morphism
AX
→
AY
.
I
claim
that
this
morphism
is
a
purely
inseparable
isogeny
.
Indeed,
by
various
wellknown
Leftshetz
theorem-type
results
(cf.,
[SGA2],
XII,
Corollary
3.5),
the
inclusion
X
→
Y
induces
an
isomorphism
π1
(X)
∼
=
π1
(Y
);
since
(by
the
universal
property
of
the
Albanese
variety
as
the
“minimal
abelian
variety
to
which
the
original
variety
maps”)
we
have
surjections
π1
(X)

π1
(AX
),
π1
(Y
)

π1
(AY
),
we
thus
obtain
that
π1
(AX
)

π1
(AY
)
is
a
surjection.
Moreover,
since
X
→
AX
,
Y
→
AY
induce
isomorphisms
on
the
respectively
étale
ﬁrst
cohomology
groups
with
Zl
-coeﬃcients
(where
l
is
prime
to
the
characteristic
of
k),
we
thus
obtain
that
π1
(AX
)

π1
(AY
)
is
a
surjection
which
is
an
isomorphism
on
the
respective
maximal
pro-l
quotients.
Now
it
follows
from
the
elementary
theory
of
abelian
varieties
that
this
implies
that
AX
→
AY
is
a
isogeny
of
degree
a
power
of
p.
Finally,
applying
again
the
fact
that
π1
(AX
)

π1
(AY
)
is
surjective
(i.e.,
even
on
maximal
pro-p
quotients),
we
conclude
(again
from
the
elementary
theory
of
abelian
varieties)
that
this
isogeny
has
trivial
étale
part,
hence
is
purely
inseparable,
as
desired.
Note
that
since
AX
→
AY
is
an
isogeny,
it
follows
in
particular
that
it
is
faithfully
ﬂat.
Now
let
γX
:
X
→
C
be
a
dominant
k-morphism.
Write
αX
:
AX
→
AC
for
the
induced
morphism
on
Albanese
varieties.
If
γX
arises
from
some
γY
:
Y
→
C,
then
this
γY
is
unique.
Indeed,
γY
is
determined
by
its
associated
αY
,
and
the
composite
of
αY
with
AX
→
AY
is
given
by
αX
(which
is
uniquely
determined
by
γX
).
Thus,
the
fact
that
αY
is
uniquely
determined
follows
from
the
fact
that
AX
→
AY
is
faithfully
ﬂat.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
claim,
and
hence
of
the
injectivity
portion
of
the
bijectivity
assertion
in
Theorem
2.2.
Now
suppose
that
γX
is
arbitrary
(i.e.,
does
not
necessarily
arise
from
some
γY
).
The
surjectivity
portion
of
the
bijectivity
assertion
in
Theorem
2.2
amounts
to
showing
that,
up
to
replacing
γX
by
the
composite
of
γX
with
some
power
of
ΦX
,
γX
necessarily
arises
from
some
γY
:
Y
→
C.
Now
although
αX
:
AX
→
AC
itself
might
not
factor
through
AY
,
since
AX
→
AY
is
purely
inseparable,
it
follows
that
the
composite
of
αX
with
some
power
of
ΦAX
will
factor
through
AY
.
Thus,
if
we
replace
γX
by
the
composite
of
γX
with
some
power
of
ΦX
,
then
αX
will
factor
(uniquely)
through
AY
.
Let
us
denote
this
morphism
by
αY
:
AY
→
AC
.
Thus,
in
order
to
complete
the
proof
of
surjectivity,
it
suﬃces
to
show:
(*)
The
restriction
αY
|Y
of
αY
to
Y
(relative
to
the
natural
morphism
Y
→
AY
)
maps
into
the
subvariety
C
⊆
AC
.
Before
continuing,
we
observe
the
following:
(1)
The
assertion
(*)
for
characteristic
zero
k
follows
immediately
from
the
assertion
(*)
for
k
of
ﬁnite
characteristic.
Indeed,
this
follows
via
the
usual
argument
of
replacing
k
ﬁrst
by
a
ﬁnitely
generated
Z-algebra,
and
then
14
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
reducing
modulo
various
primes.
Thus,
in
the
following,
we
assume
the
k
is
of
characteristic
p
>
0.
(2)
The
assertion
(*)
will
follow
if
we
can
show
that
the
restriction
αY
|Y
(where
we
write
Y
for
the
completion
of
Y
along
X)
maps
into
C
⊆
AC
.
Now
let
us
show
that
(up
to
possibly
composing
γX
again
with
a
power
of
Frobenius),
γX
extends
to
Y
.
If
I
is
the
sheaf
of
ideals
on
Y
that
deﬁnes
the
closed
def
subscheme
X
⊆
Y
,
then
let
us
write
Yn
=
V
(I
n
)
⊆
Y
for
the
n-th
inﬁnitesimal
def
neighborhood
of
X
in
Y
,
and
J
=
I|X
∼
=
OX
(−1).
Write
T
for
the
pull-back
of
the
tangent
bundle
of
C
to
X
via
γX
.
Since
T
−1
is
generated
by
global
sections,
it
thus
follows
that
T
−1
⊗
J
−1
is
ample,
hence,
by
Serre
duality
(cf.,
e.g.,
[Harts],
Chapter
III,
Theorem
7.6),
together
with
the
fact
that
dim(X)
≥
2,
that
there
exists
a
natural
number
N
such
that
N
N
H
1
(X,
T
⊗p
⊗
J
⊗p
)
=
0
Note
that
this
implies
that
for
all
n
≥
pN
,
we
have:
N
H
1
(X,
T
⊗p
⊗
J
⊗n
)
=
0
(Indeed,
it
suﬃces
to
assume
that
n
>
pN
.
Then
since
J
−1
∼
=
OX
(1)
is
very
ample,
it
follows
that
there
exists
a
section
s
∈
Γ(X,
OX
(1))
whose
zero
locus
def
Z
=
V
(s)
⊆
X
is
smooth
of
dimension
≥
1.
Thus,
s
deﬁnes
an
exact
sequence
N
N
N
0
→
T
⊗p
⊗
J
⊗n
→
T
⊗p
⊗
J
⊗n−1
→
T
⊗p
⊗
J
⊗n−1
|Z
→
0
whose
associated
long
exact
cohomology
sequence
yields:
N
N
N
H
0
(Z,
T
⊗p
⊗
J
⊗n−1
|Z
)
→
H
1
(X,
T
⊗p
⊗
J
⊗n
)
→
H
1
(X,
T
⊗p
⊗
J
⊗n−1
)
N
N
But
H
0
(Z,
T
⊗p
⊗
J
⊗n−1
|Z
)
=
0
since
T
⊗p
⊗
J
⊗n−1
|Z
is
the
inverse
of
an
ample
N
line
bundle
on
a
smooth
scheme
of
dimension
≥
1,
while
H
1
(X,
T
⊗p
⊗J
⊗n−1
)
=
0
by
the
induction
hypothesis.)
N
Next,
observe
that
ΦN
Y
N
:
YpN
→
YpN
factors
through
X
(since
ΦY
N
is
induced
p
p
by
raising
functions
to
the
pN
-th
power).
Thus,
if
we
compose
γX
:
X
→
C
with
ΦN
X
,
we
see
that
this
composite
extends
to
a
morphism
YpN
→
C.
Moreover,
since
N
the
pull-back
to
X
via
this
composite
of
the
tangent
bundle
on
C
is
given
by
T
⊗p
,
it
follows
that
the
obstruction
to
extending
this
composite
to
Yn+1
for
n
≥
pN
is
given
by
an
element
of
the
cohomology
group
N
H

(X,
T
⊗p
⊗
J
⊗n
)
TOPICS

which
(by
the
above
discussion
concerning
cohomology
groups)
is
zero.
Thus,
in
summary,
if
we
replace
the
given
γX
by
its
composite
with
ΦN
X
,
the
resulting
γX

extends
to
a
morphism
Y
→
C.
This
completes
the
proof
of
(*),
and
hence
of
the
entire
proof
of
Theorem
2.2.

Note

the

at
the

of
§2.1,
i.e.,
the
case
of
a
ﬁber
bundle
with
proper,
simply
connected
ﬁbers
also
admits
a
purely
algebro-geometric
proof:
namely,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
theory
of
Albanese
varieties
that
there
do
not
exist
any
nonconstant
morphisms
from
a

to
an

Remark.
The
role
played
by
the
Albanese
variety
in
the
proof
of
Theorem
2.2
given
above
suggests
that
the
property
proven
in
Corollary
2.1
and
Theorem
2.2
might
be
thought
of
as
asserting
that
a
hyperbolic
curve
is,
so
to
speak,
its
own
“anabelian
Albanese
variety.”
This
is
the
reason
for
the

of

is

In

to
make
this
motivation
more
rigorous
by
presenting
the
real
analogues
of
various
theorems/conjectures
of
anabelian
geometry.
The
substantive
mathematics
here
—
i.e.,
essentially
the
geometry
of
the
Siegel
upper
half-plane
and
Teichmüller
space
—
is
not
new,
but
has
been
well-known
to
topologists,
Teichmüller
theorists,
and
symmetric
domain
theorists
for
some
time.
What
is
(perhaps)
new
is
the
formulation
or
point
of
view
presented
here,
namely,
that
these
geometric
facts
should
be
regarded
as
real
analogues
of
Grothendieck’s
conjectured
anabelian
geometry.
§3.1.
Real
Complex
Manifolds
We
begin
with
the
following
purely
analytic
deﬁnition:
Let
X
be
a
complex
manifold
and
ι
an
anti-holomorphic
involution
(i.e.,
automorphism
of
order
2)
of
X.
Deﬁnition
3.1.
A
pair
such
as
(X,
ι)
will
be
referred
to
as
a
real
complex
manifold.
If
X
has
the
structure
of
an
abelian
variety
whose
origin
is
ﬁxed
by
ι,
then
(X,
ι)
will
be
referred
to
as
a
real
abelian
variety.
If
dimC
(X)
=
1,
then
(X,
ι)
16
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
will
be
referred
to
as
a
real
Riemann
surface.
A
real
Riemann
surface
(X,
ι)
will
be
called
hyperbolic
if
the
universal
covering
space
of
X
is
isomorphic
(as
a
Riemann
def
surface)
to
the
upper
half-plane
H
=
{z
∈
C
|
Im(z)
>
0}.
Remark.
Note
that
if
XR
is
a
smooth
algebraic
variety
over
R,
then
XR
(C)
equipped
with
the
anti-holomorphic
involution
deﬁned
by
complex
conjugation
deﬁnes
a
real
complex
manifold
(X,
ι).
Moreover,
one
checks
easily
that
XR
is
uniquely
determined
by
(X,
ι).
Conversely,
any
real
complex
manifold
(X,
ι)
such
that
X
is
projective
arises
from
a
unique
algebraic
variety
XR
over
R.
Indeed,
this
follows
easily
from
“Chow’s
Theorem”
(that
any
projective
complex
manifold
is
necessarily
algebraic)
and
the
(related)
fact
that
any
holomorphic
isomorphism
between
projective
algebraic
varieties
(in
this
case,
the
given
X
and
its
complex
conjugate)
is
necessarily
algebraic.
Thus,
in
summary,
one
motivating
reason
for
the
introduction
of
Deﬁnition
3.1
is
that
it
allows
one
to
describe
the
notion
of
a
(proper,
smooth)
algebraic
variety
over
R
entirely
in
terms
of
complex
manifolds
and
analytic
maps.
Remark.
In
the
case
of
one
complex
dimension,
one
does
not
even
need
to
assume
projectivity:
That
is,
any
real
Riemann
surface
(X,
ι)
such
that
X
is
algebraic
arises
from
a
unique
algebraic
curve
XR
over
R.
Indeed,
this
follows
easily
by
observing
that
any
holomorphic
isomorphism
between
Riemann
surfaces
associated
to
complex
algebraic
curves
is
necessarily
algebraic.
(Note
that
this
may
be
proven
by
noting
that
any
such
isomorphism
extends
naturally
to
the
“one-point
compactiﬁcations”
of
the
Riemann
surfaces
(which
have
natural
algebraic
structures),
hence
is
necessarily
algebraizable.)
It
is
not
clear
to
the
author
whether
or
not
this
can
be
generalized
to
higher
dimensions.
In
the
following,
we
shall
consider
various
groups
G
with
natural
augmentations
G
→
Gal(C/R).
In
this
sort
of
situation,
we
shall
denote
the
inverse
image
of
the
identity
element
(respectively,
the
complex
conjugation
element)
in
Gal(C/R)
by
G+
(respectively,
G−
).
If
X
is
a
complex
manifold,
then
we
shall
denote
by
Aut(X)
→
Gal(C/R)
the
group
of
automorphisms
of
X
which
are
either
holomorphic
or
anti-holomorphic,
equipped
with
its
natural
augmentation
(which
sends
holomorphic
(respectively,
anti-holomorphic)
automorphisms
to
the
identity
(respectively,
complex
conjugation
element)
in
Gal(C/R)).
Thus,
Aut+
(X),
Aut−
(X)
⊆
Aut(X)
denote
the
subsets
of
holomorphic
and
anti-holomorphic
automorphisms,
respectively.
In
many
cases,
X
will
come
equipped
with
a
natural
Riemannian
metric

which
is
preserved
by
Aut(X).
The
principal
examples
of
this
situation
are
the
following:
Example

us
write
(The
Siegel
Upper
Half-Plane)
Let
g
≥
1
be
an
integer.
Let
def
Hg
=
{Z
∈
Mg
(C)
|
Z
=
t
Z;
Im(Z)
>
0}
(where
“t
”
denotes
the
“transpose
matrix,”
and
“>
0”
is
to
be
understood
to
mean
“positive
deﬁnite”)
for
the
Siegel
upper
half-plane.
(Thus,
H1
is
the
usual
upper
half-plane
H.)
We
shall
regard
H
g

a

Write

η

def
for
the
group
of
symplectic
similitudes.
Thus,
we
have
a
natural
character
χ
:
GSp2g
→
Gal(C/R)
that
maps
an
M
∈
GSp2g
to
the
sign
of
η
(where
η
is
as
in
the
above
deﬁni−
tion
of
GSp2g
).
In
particular,
χ
deﬁnes
GSp+
2g
,
GSp2g
.
Then
we
have
a
natural
homomorphism
φ
:
GSp2g
→
Aut(Hg
)

given
by
letting
M

act
on
Z
∈
Hg
by
Z

(AZ
χ(M
)
+
B)(CZ
χ(M
)
+
D)−1
Thus,
φ
is
compatible
with
the
augmentations
to
Gal(C/R).
Now
it
is
clear
that
the
kernel
of
φ
is
given
by
the
scalars
R×
⊆
GSp2g
.
In
fact,
φ
is
surjective.
Indeed,
this
is
well-known
when
+’s
are
added
to
both
sides
(i.e.,
for
holomorphic
automorphisms
—
cf.,
e.g.,
[Maass],
§4,
Theorem
2).
On
the
other
hand,
since
φ
is
compatible
with
the
augmentations
to
Gal(C/R),
the
surjectivity
of
φ
thus
follows
from
the
“5-Lemma.”
Thus,
in
summary,
we
have
a
natural
isomorphism
GSp2g
/R×
∼
=
Aut(Hg
)
Moreover,
the
space
Hg
admits
a
natural
Riemannian
metric.
Relative
to
this
metric,
any
two
points
Z1
,
Z2
of
Hg
can
be
joined
by
a
unique
geodesic
(cf.
[Maass],
§3,
18
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
Theorem).
Moreover,
this
Riemannian
metric
is
preserved
by
the
action
of
GSp2g
on
Hg
.
(Indeed,
this
follows
from
[Maass],
§4,
Theorem
1,
in
the
holomorphic
case.
As
for
the
anti-holomorphic
case,
it
suﬃces
to
check
that
the
metric
is
preserved
by
a
single
anti-holomorphic
map.
But
this
is
clear
from
[Maass],
§4,
Theorem
1,
for
the
map
Z
→
−Z.)
Example
3.3.
(Teichmüller
Space)
Let
g,
r
≥
0
be
integers
such
that
2g
−
2
+
r
>
0.
Let
us
denote
by
Tg,r
the
Teichmüller
space
of
genus
g
Riemann
surfaces
with
r
marked
points.
Thus,
Tg,r
has
a
natural
structure
of
complex
manifold.
Moreover,
Tg,r
is
equipped
with
a
natural
Kähler
metric,
called
the
Weil-Petersson
metric,
whose
associated
Riemannian
metric
has
the
property
that
any
two
points
t1
,
t2
∈
Tg,r
may
be
joined
by
a
unique
geodesic
(cf.
[Wolp],
§5.1).
Write
Modg,r
for
the
full
modular
group,
i.e.,
the
group
of
homotopy
classes
of
homeomorphisms
of
a
topological
surface
of
type
(g,
r)
onto
itself.
Note
that
Modg,r
is
equipped
with
an
augmentation
Modg,r
→
Gal(C/R)
given
by
considering
whether
or
not
the
homeomorphism
preserves
the
orientation
of
the
surface.
The
quotient
Tg,r
/Mod+
g,r
(in
the
sense
of
stacks)
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
moduli
stack
Mg,r
of
hyperbolic
curves
of
type
(g,
r)
over
C,
and
the
Weil-Petersson
metric
descends
to
Mg,r
.
Moreover,
the
Riemannian
metric
arising
from
the
Weil-Petersson
metric
on
Mg,r
is
preserved
by
complex
conjugation.
Indeed,
this
follows
easily,
for
instance,
from
the
deﬁnition
of
the
Weil-Petersson
metric
in
terms
of
integration
of
the
square
of
the
absolute
value
of
a
quadratic
diﬀerential
(on
the
Riemann
surface
in
question)
divided
by
the
(1,
1)-form
given
by
the
Poincaré
metric
(on
the
Riemann
surface
in
question)
—
cf.,
e.g,
[Wolp],
§1.4.
If
(g,
r)
is
not
exceptional
(i.e.,
not
equal
to
the
cases
(0,
3),
(0,
4),
(1,
1),
(1,
2),
or
(2,
0)),
then
it
is
known
(by
a
theorem
of
Royden
—
cf.,
e.g.,
[Gard],
§9.2,
Theorem
2)
that
one
has
a
natural
isomorphism
Modg,r
∼
=
Aut(Tg,r
)
which
is
compatible
with
the
natural
augmentations
to
Gal(C/R).
Now
I
claim
that
(at
least
if
(g,
r)
is
nonexceptional,
then)
Aut(Tg,r
)
preserves
(the
Riemannian
metric
arising
from)
the
Weil-Petersson
metric.
Indeed,
since
Tg,r
/Mod+
g,r
=
Mg,r
,
and
the
Weil-Petersson
metric
descends
to
Mg,r
,
it
thus
follows
that
Mod+
g,r
preserves
the
Weil-Petersson
metric.
Thus,
the
claim
follows
from
the
fact
(observed
above)
that
(the
Riemannian
metric
arising
from)
the
Weil-Petersson
metric
on
Mg,r
is
preserved
by
complex
conjugation.
Now
let
us
return
to
our
discussion
of
an
arbitrary
real
complex
manifold
(X,
ι).
By
analogy
with
the
case
when
(X,
ι)
arises
from
a
real
algebraic
variety
(cf.
the
TOPICS
IN
ANABELIAN
GEOMETRY
19
Remark
following
Deﬁnition
3.1),
we
will
refer
to
the
ﬁxed
point
locus
of
ι
as
the
real
locus
of
(X,
ι),
and
use
the
notation
X(R)
for
this
locus.
Observe
that
X(R)
is
necessarily
a
real
analytic
submanifold
of
X
of
real
dimension
equal
to
the
complex
dimension
of
X.
(Indeed,
this
follows
immediately
by
considering
the
local
structure
of
ι
at
a
point
x
∈
X(R).)
Moreover,
at
any
x
∈
X(R),
the
involution
ι
induces
a
semi-linear
(i.e.,
with
respect
to
complex
conjugation)
automorphism
ιx
of
order
2
of
the
complex
vector
space
Tx
(X)
(i.e.,
the
tangent
space
to
the
complex
manifold
X
at
x).
That
is
to
say,
ιx
deﬁnes
a
real
structure
Tx
(X)R
⊆
Tx
(X)R
⊗R
C
=
Tx
(X)
on
Tx
(X).
Put
another
way,
this
real
structure
Tx
(X)R
is
simply
the
tangent
space
to
the
real
analytic
submanifold
X(R)
⊆
X.
Since
ι
acts
without
ﬁxed
points
on
X\X(R),
it
follows
that
the
quotient
of
X\X(R)
by
the
action
of
ι
deﬁnes
a
real
analytic
manifold
over
which
X\X(R)
forms
an
unramiﬁed
double
cover.
In
the
following,
in
order
to
analyze
the
action
of
ι
on
all
of
X,
we
would
like
to
consider
the
quotient
of
X
by
the
action
of
ι
in
the
sense
of
real
analytic
stacks.
Let
us
denote
this
quotient
by
X
ι
.
Thus,
we
have
an
unramiﬁed
double
cover
X
→
Xι
which
extends
the
cover
discussed
above
over
X\X(R).
The
Galois
group
of
this
double
cover
(which
is
isomorphic
to
Z/2Z)
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
Galois
group
Gal(C/R).
Thus,
this
double
cover
induces
a
short
exact
sequence
of
fundamental
groups

π1

→
π1
(X

we

since
they
are
inessential
to
the
following
discussion.

in

of

§3.2.
Fixed
Points
of
Anti-Holomorphic
Involutions
Let
T
be
a
(nonempty)
complex
manifold
which
is
also
equipped
with
a
smooth
Riemannian
metric.
Let
us
also
assume
that
the
Riemannian
metric
on
T
satisﬁes
the
following
property:
(*)
For
any
two
distinct
points
t1
,
t2
∈
T
,
there
exists
a
unique
geodesic
joining
t1
and
t2
.
Then
we
have
the
following
result,
which
is
fundamental
to
the
theory
of
the
present
§3:
Lemma
3.5.
Let
T
be
a
(nonempty)
complex
manifold
equipped
with
a
smooth
Riemannian
metric
satisfying
the
condition
(*).
Let
ιT
:
T
→
T
be
an
antiholomorphic
involution
of
T
which
preserves
this
Riemannian
metric.
Then
the
def
ﬁxed
point
set
FιT
=
{t
∈
T
|
ιT
(t)
=
t}
of
ιT
is
a
nonempty,
connected
real
analytic
submanifold
of
T
of
real
dimension
equal
to
the
complex
dimension
of
T
.
Proof.
By
the
discussion
of
§3.1,
it
follows
that
it
suﬃces
to
prove
that
ιT
is
nonempty
and
connected.
First,
we
prove
nonemptiness.
Let
t1
∈
T
be
any
point
def
of
T
,
and
set
t2
=
ιT
(t1
).
If
t1
=
t2
,
then
t1
∈
FιT
,
so
we
are
done.
If
t1
=
t2
,
then
let
γ
be
the
unique
geodesic
joining
t1
,
t2
.
Then
since
the
subset
{t1
,
t2
}
is
preserved
by
ιT
,
it
follows
that
γ
is
also
preserved
by
ιT
.
Thus,
it
follows
in
particular
that
the
midpoint
t
of
γ
is
preserved
by
ιT
,
i.e.,
that
t
∈
FιT
,
so
FιT
is
nonempty
as
desired.
Connectedness
follows
similarly:
If
t1
,
t2
∈
FιT
,
then
the
unique
geodesic
γ

21
joining
t1
,
t2
is
also
clearly
ﬁxed
by
ιT
,
i.e.,
γ
⊆
FιT
,
so
FιT
is
pathwise
connected.

The

been
used
to
give
a
solution
of
the
Nielsen
Realization
Problem
(cf.
the
Introduction
of
[Wolp]).
It
is
easiest
to
see
what
is
going
on
by
thinking
about
what
happens
in
the
case
when
T
=
H
(the
2
2
upper
half-plane)
equipped
with
the
Poincaré
metric
dx
y+dy
.
Also,
we
remark
that
2
1
in
the
case
when
T
=
PC
,
both
the
hypothesis
and
the
conclusion
of
Lemma
3.5
are
false!
(That
is,
the
hypothesis
is
false
because
there
will
always
exist
“conjugate
points,”
and
the
conclusion
is
false
because
it
is
easy
to
construct
examples
of
anti-holomorphic
involutions
without
ﬁxed
points.)
Now
assume
that
(X,
ι)
is
any
real
complex
manifold
equipped
with
a
smooth
Riemannian
metric
(i.e.,
X
is
equipped
with
a
smooth
Riemannian
metric
preserved
def

by
ι)
such
that
the
induced
Riemannian
metric
on
the
universal
cover
T
=
X
satisﬁes
(*).
Let
Y
⊆
X(R)
be
a
connected
component
of
the
real
analytic
manifold
X(R).
Then
since
ι
acts
trivially
on
Y
,
the
quotient
of
Y
by
the
action
of
ι
forms
a
real
analytic
stack
Y
ι
whose
associated
coarse
space
is
Y
itself,
and
which
ﬁts
into
a
commutative
diagram:
Y
⏐
⏐

−→
Yι
⏐
⏐

X
−→
Xι
Moreover,
the
mapping
Y
ι
→
Y
(where
we
think
of
Y
as
the
coarse
space
associated
to
the
stack
Y
ι
)
deﬁnes
a
splitting
of
the
exact
sequence:
1
→
π1
(Y
)
→
π1
(Y
ι
)
→
Gal(C/R)
→
1
hence
a
homomorphism
Gal(C/R)
→
π1
(Y
ι
).
If
we
compose
this
homomorphism
with
the
natural
homomorphism
π1
(Y
ι
)
→
π1
(X
ι
),
then
we
get
a
morphism
αY
:
Gal(C/R)
→
π1
(X
ι
)
naturally
associated
to
Y
,
which
is
well-deﬁned
up
to
composition
with
an
inner
autormorphism
of
π1
(X).
In
particular,
the
image
of
complex
conjugation
under
αY
deﬁnes
a
conjugacy
class
of
involutions
ιY
of
π1
(X
ι
).
Thus,
to
summarize,
we
have
associated
to
each
connected
component
Y
⊆
X(R)
of
the
real
locus
of
(X,
ι)
a
conjugacy
class
of
involutions
ιY
in
π1
(X
ι
).
Now
we
have
the
following
immediate
consequence
of
Lemma
3.5:
22
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
Theorem
3.6.
(“General
Discrete
Real
Section
Conjecture”)
Let
(X,
ι)
be
a
real
complex
manifold
equipped
with
a
smooth
Riemannian
metric
(i.e.,
X
is
equipped
with
a
smooth
Riemannian
metric
preserved
by
ι)
such
that
the
induced

satisﬁes
(*).
Then
the
correspondence
Riemannian
metric
on
the
universal
cover
X
Y
→
ιY
deﬁnes
a
bijection
π0
(X(R))
∼
=
HomGal(C/R)
(Gal(C/R),
π1
(X
ι
))
from
the
set
of
connected
components
of
the
real
locus
X(R)
to
the
set
of
conjugacy
classes
of
sections
of
π1
(X
ι
)
→
Gal(C/R)
(or,
equivalently,
involutions
in
π1
(X
ι
)).
Moreover,
the
centralizer
of
an
involution
ιY
∈
π1
(X
ι
)
is
the
image
of
π1
(Y
ι
)
in
π1
(X
ι
).
Proof.
Indeed,
let
ιT
∈
π1
(X
ι
)
be
an
involution.
Then
ιT
may
be
thought
of
as
an
def

anti-holomorphic
involution
of
T
=
X.
By
Lemma
3.5,
the
ﬁxed
point
locus
FιT
of
ιT
is
nonempty
and
connected.
Thus,
FιT
maps
into
some
connected
component
Y
⊆
X(R).
(In
fact,
the
morphism
FιT
→
Y
is
a
covering
map.)
By
functoriality
(consider
the
map
of
triples
(T,
ιT
,
FιT
)
→
(X,
ι,
Y
)!),
it
follows
that
ιY
=
ιT
.
Thus,
every
involution
in
π1
(X
ι
)
arises
as
some
ιY
.
Next,
let
us
show
uniqueness.
If
ιT
arises
from
two
distinct
Y1
,
Y2
⊆
X(R),
then
it
would
follow
that
the
ﬁxed
point
locus
FιT
contains
at
least
two
distinct
connected
components
(corresponding
to
Y1
,
Y2
),
thus
contradicting
Lemma
3.5.
Finally,
if
α
∈
π1
(X
ι
)
commutes
with
ιY
,
then
α
preserves
FιY
,
hence
induces
an
automorphism
of
FιY
over
Y
ι
.
But
since
FιY
→
Y
ι
is
a
covering
map,
this
implies
that
α
is
in
the
image
of
π1
(Y
ι
)
in
π1
(X
ι
).
This
completes
the
proof.

Remark.
Thus,
Theorem
3.6
is
a
sort
of
analogue
of
the

the

Remark.
Theorem
3.6
generalizes
immediately
to
the
case
where
X
is
a
complex
analytic
stack.
In
this
case,
“Y
ι
”
is
to
be
understood
to
be
the
real
analytic
stack
whose
stack
structure
is
inherited
from
that
of
the

Remark.
Some

may
ﬁnd
it
strange
that
there
is
no
discussion
of
“tangential
sections”
(at
the
“points
at
inﬁnity”
of
X)
in
Corollary
3.7.
The
reason
for
this
is
that
in
the
present
“real
context,”
where
we
only
consider
connected
components
of
the
set
of
real
points,
every
tangential
section
arising
from
a
real
point
at
inﬁnity
may
be
obtained
as
a
limit
of
a
sequence
of
real
points
that
are
not
at
inﬁnity
(and,
which,
moreover,
may
be
chosen
to
lie
in
the
same
connected
components
of
the
real
locus),
hence
is
“automatically
included”
in
the
connected
component
containing
those
real
points.

§3.4.
Abelian
Varieties
and
their
Moduli
24
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
We
begin
with
a
lemma:
Lemma
3.9.
Let
(X,
ι)
be
a
real
complex
manifold
such
that
X
is
an
abelian
variety
over
C.
Then
there
exists
a
translation-invariant
Riemannian
metric
on
X
which
is
preserved
by
ι.
Proof.
By
the
Remark
following
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(X,
ι)
arises
from
a
projective
algebraic
variety
XR
over
R.
Write
X
c
for
the
complex
conjugate
of
the
complex
manifold
X
(i.e.,
X
c
and
X
have
the
same
underlying
real
analytic
manifold,
but
holomorphic
functions
on
X
c
are
anti-holomorphic
functions
on
X).
Since
X
is
an
abelian
variety
over
C,
it
follows
that
X
c
is
also
an
abelian
variety
over
C.
Thus,
the
holomorphic
isomorphism
ι
:
X
∼
=
X
c
is
the
composite
of
an
isomorphism
of
abelian
varieties
(i.e.,
one
which
preserves
the
group
structures)
with
a
translation.
def
In
particular,
it
follows
that
ι
preserves
the
invariant
diﬀerentials
V
=
Γ(X,
ΩX
)
on
X.
Thus,
ι
induces
a
semi-linear
(with
respect
to
complex
conjugation)
automorphism
of
V
,
i.e.,
ι
induces
a
real
structure
VR
⊆
VR
×R
C
=
V
on
V
.
Then
any
inner
product
on
the
real
vector
space
VR
induces
an
ι-invariant
inner
product
on
the
underlying
real
vector
space
of
V
which,
in
turn,
induces
a
translation-invariant
Riemannian
metric
on
X
which
is
preserved
by
ι,
as
desired.


arising
from
a
Riemannian
metric
Remark.
Note
that
any
Riemannian
metric
on
X

which
is
isomorphic
as
in
the
conclusion
of
Lemma
3.9
induces
a
geometry
on
X
to
Euclidean
space,
hence
enjoys
the
property
that
any
two
points
are
joined
by
a
unique
geodesic.
Now
if
we
apply
Theorem
3.6
using
Lemma
3.9,
Example
3.2,
we
obtain
the
following:
Corollary
3.10.
(“Discrete
Real
Section

Varieties”)
Let
(X,
ι)
be
a
real
abelian

Then
the
correspondence
Y
→
ιY
of
§3.2
deﬁnes
a

Let

This

Moreover,
the

is
the

Proof.
Note
that
the
bijectivity
of
the
natural

π1

follows
from
the
fact
that
it

compatible
with

on
both

to
Gal(C/R)
(where
the

given
by
looking
at
the

§3.5.
Proﬁnite
Real
Anabelian
Geometry
So
far
we
have
considered
the
real
analogue
of
Grothendieck’s
anabelian
geometry
given
by
using
the
discrete
fundamental
groups
of
varieties.
Another
“real
analogue”
of
anabelian
geometry
is
that
given
by
using
the
proﬁnite
fundamental
groups.
Just
as
in
the
discrete,
the
fundamental
result
was
an
existence
theorem
for
real
points
in
the
presence
of
involutions
(i.e.,
Lemma
3.5),
in
the
proﬁnite
case,
the
fundamental
existence
is
given
by
the
following
theorem
of
Cox
(cf.
[Frdl],
Corollary

Remark.
In
particular,
if
the
complex
manifold
X(C)
is
a
“K(π,

space
(i.e.,
its
universal
cover
is
contractible),
and,
moreover,
its
fundamental
group
π1
(X(C))
is
good
(i.e.,
the
cohomology
of
π1
(X(C))
with
coeﬃcients
in
any
ﬁnite
π1
(X(C))module
is
isomorphic
(via
the
natural
morphism)
to
the
cohomology
of
the
proﬁnite
completion
of

with
coeﬃcients
in
that

then
we
obtain
that:

(where

Also,
let
us
observe
that
if
the

a

i

Since

satisfy
the
conditions

we
thus
obtain
the

real
locus
X(R)
to
the
set
of
conjugacy
classes
of
sections
of
π1alg
(X)
→
Gal(C/R)
(or,
equivalently,
involutions
in
π1alg
(X)).
Proof.
Surjectivity
follows
from
the
above
Remark,
using
the
technique
of
[Tama1]:
Namely,
given
a
section
α
:
Gal(C/R)
→
π1alg
(X)
of
π1alg
(X)
→
Gal(C/R),
the
family
of
open
subgroups
of
π1alg
(X)
containing
Im(α)
deﬁnes
a
system
of
coverings
{Xi
→
X}
(as
i
varies
over
the
elements
of
some
index
set
I)
such
that
(by
the
above
Remark)
each
Xi
(R)
=
0.
Since
each
Xi
(R)
has
only
ﬁnitely
many
connected
components,
it
thus
follows
that
there
exists
a
compatible
system
(indexed
by
I)
of
connected
components
of
Xi
(R).
But
this
amounts
to
the
assertion
that
α
arises
from
some
connected
component
of
X(R),
as
desired
(cf.
[Tama1],
Corollary
2.10).
Injectivity
follows
from
the
fact
that
involutions
arising
from
distinct
connected
components
deﬁne
distinct
elements
of
H
1
(π1alg
(X),
Z/2Z)
—
cf.
[Schd],

Remark.
To
the
author’s
knowledge,
the
ﬁrst
announcement
in
the
literature
of
a
result
such
as
Corollary
3.13
(in
the
proper
case)
appears
in
a
manuscript
of
Huisman
([Huis]).
(In
fact,
[Huis]
also
treats
the
one-dimensional
case
of
Corollary
3.14
below.)
Unfortunately,
however,
the
author
was
not
able
to
follow
the
portion
of
Huisman’s
proof
([Huis],
Lemma
5.7)
that
corresponds
to
the
application
of
Cox’s
theorem
(as
in
the
Remark
following
Lemma
3.12).
Corollary

(“Proﬁnite

Let
X
be
an
abelian
variety
over

from
the
set
of
connected
components
of
the
real
locus
X(R)
to
the
set
of
conjugacy
classes
of
sections
of
π1alg
(X)
→
Gal(C/R)
(or,
equivalently,
involutions
in
π1alg
(X)).
Proof.
Surjectivity
follows
as
in
the
proof
of
Corollary
3.13.
Injectivity
follows,
for
instance,
from
the
discrete
result
(Corollary
3.10),
together
with
the
injectivity
of
the
natural
morphism
H
1
(Gal(C/R),
π1
(X(C)))
→
H
1
(Gal(C/R),
π1alg
(X
⊗R
C))

where
Z

—
itself
a
consequence
of
the
fact
that
π1alg
(X
⊗R
C))
=
π1
(X(C))
⊗Z
Z,
is
the
proﬁnite
completion
of
Z
(hence
a
faithfully
ﬂat
Z-module).

As
for
the
case
of
moduli,
the
above
argument
breaks
down
in
most
cases
since
it
is
either
false
that
or
unknown
whether
or
not
the
fundamental
group
of
the
corresponding
moduli
stacks
is
good.
More
precisely,
π1
(Ag
)
=
Sp(2g,
Z)
is
known
not
to
be
good
if
g
≥
2
(cf.
Lemma
3.16
below).
(If
g
=
1,
then
the
“proﬁnite
real
section
conjecture”
for
Ag
is
essentially
contained
in
Corollary
3.13
above.)
On
the
other
hand,
to
the
author’s
knowledge,
it
is
not
known
whether
or
not
π1
(Mg,r
)
is
good
if
g
>
2.
If
g
≤
2,
then,
up
to
passing
to
ﬁnite
étale
coverings,
Mg,r
may
be
written
as
a
successive
extension
of
smooth
families
of
hyperbolic
curves,
hence
has
a
good
fundamental
group.
Thus,
we
obtain
the
following:
Corollary
3.15.
(“Proﬁnite
Real
Section
Conjecture
for
Moduli
of
Hyperbolic
Curves
of
Genus
≤
2”)
Let
g,
r
≥
0
be
integers
such
that
2g−2+r
>
0,
g
≤
2.
Write
(Mg,r
)R
for
the
moduli
stack
of
complex
hyperbolic
curves
of
type
(g,
r)
over
R.
If
X
is
a
real
hyperbolic
curve
of
type
(g,
r),
then
X
deﬁnes
a
section
α(X,ι)
:
Gal(C/R)
→
π1alg
((Mg,r
)R
).
This
correspondence
(X,
ι)
→
α(X,ι)
deﬁnes
a
bijection
alg
π0
((Mg,r
)R
(R))
∼
=
HomGal(C/R)
(Gal(C/R),
π1
((Mg,r
)R
))
from
the
set
of
connected
components
of
(Mg,r
)R
(R)
to
the
set
of
conjugacy
classes
of
sections
of
π1alg
((Mg,r
)R
)
→
Gal(C/R)
(or,
equivalently,
conjugacy
classes
of
involutions
in
π1alg
((Mg,r
)R
)).
Moreover,
the
centralizer
of
an
involution
ιY
∈
π1alg
((Mg,r
)R
)
is
the
image
of
the
proﬁnite
completion
of
π1
(Y
ι
)
in
π1alg
((Mg,r
)R
).
Proof.
Since
(as
just
remarked)
the
fundamental
groups
involved
are
good,
surjectivity
follows
as
in
Corollaries
3.13,
3.14.
As
for
injectivity,
we
reason
as
follows.
Given
two
real
hyperbolic
curves
X,
Y
of
the
same
type
(g,
r)
which
induce
the
same
section
α
(up
to
conjugacy)
of
π1alg
((Mg,r
)R
)
→
Gal(C/R),
we
must
show
that
they
belong
to
the
same
connected
component
of
(Mg,r
)R
(R).
First,
let
us
observe
that
since
[C
:
R]
=
2,
it
follows
28
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
that
the
marked
points
of
X
and
Y
over
C
consist
of:
(i.)
points
deﬁned
over
R;
(ii)
complex
conjugate
pairs.
Moreover,
the
combinatorial
data
of
which
points
are
deﬁned
over
R
and
which
points
are
conjugate
pairs
is
clearly
determined
by
the
section
α.
Thus,
there
exists
an
“ordering
of
connected
components
of
the
divisor
of
marked
points
over
R”
of
X,
Y
,
which
is
compatible
with
α.
Write
N
→
(Mg,r
)R
for
the
ﬁnite
étale
covering
deﬁned
by
the
moduli
stack
(over
R)
of
hyperbolic
curves
equipped
with
such
an
ordering.
Note,
in
particular,
that
the
injectivity
assertion
under
consideration
for
(Mg,r
)R
follows
formally
from
the
corresponding
injectivity
assertion
for
N
.
Moreover,
N
may
be
written
as
a
“successive
extension”
N
=
Nr
→
Nr−1
→
.
.
.
→
N1
→
N0
of
smooth
families
(i.e.,
the
Nj+1
→
Nj
)
of
either
hyperbolic
curves
(where
we
include
curves
which
are
stacks
—
cf.
the
remark
in
parentheses
following
the
list
below)
or
surfaces
(of
a
special
type,
to
be
described
below)
over
the
stack
N0
,
where
N0
may
be
described
as
follows:
(1)
If
g
=
0,
then
N0
is
the
moduli
stack
of
4-pointed
curves
of
genus
0,
equipped
with
an
“ordering
type”
T
,
where
T
is
one
of
the
following:
a
total
ordering
of
the
four
points;
a
total
ordering
of
two
points,
plus
a
pair
of
conjugate
points;
a
total
ordering
of
two
pairs
of
conjugate
points.
In
each
of
these
three
cases,
one
sees
that
N0
is
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
R,
so
we
conclude
the
corresponding
injectivity
assertion
for
N0
from
Corollary
3.13.
(2)
If
g
=
1,
then
N0
is
either
the
moduli
stack
of
1-pointed
curves
of
genus
1
(which
is
a
hyperbolic
curve,
so
we
may
conclude
the
corresponding
injectivity
assertion
for
N0
from
Corollary
3.13),
or
N0
is
the
moduli
stack
of
2-pointed
curves
of
genus
1,
where
the
two
points
are
unordered.
In
the
latter
case,
by
considering
the
“group
of
automorphisms
of
the
underlying
genus
1
curve
which
preserve
the
invariant
diﬀerentials,”
we
get
a
morphism
N0
→
(M1,1
)R
,
which
is
a
smooth
family
whose
ﬁber
over
the
elliptic
curve
E
is
the
stack
given
by
forming
the
quotient
of
E\{0E
}
(where
0E
is
the
origin
of
E)
by
the
action
of
±1.
(Indeed,
this
ﬁber
parametrizes
the
“diﬀerence”
of
the
two
unordered
points.)
In
particular,
(M1,1
)R
,
as
well
as
these
ﬁbers
over
(M1,1
)R
are
hyperbolic
curves,
so
the
corresponding
injectivity
assertion
for
N0
follows
from
Corollary
3.13.
(3)
If
g
=
2,
then
N0
is
the
moduli
stack
of
0-pointed
curves
of
genus
2.
Moreover,
by
using
the
well-known
morphism
(M2,0
)R
→
(M0,6
)R
(given
by
considering
the
ramiﬁcation
points
of
the
canonical
double
covering
of
the
projective
line
associated
to
a
curve
of
genus
2),
this
case
may
be
reduced
to
the
case
g
=
0,
which
has
already
been
dealt
with.

IN

(We
remark
here
that
even
though
some
of
the
hyperbolic
curves
appearing
above
are
in
fact
stacks,
by
passing
to
appropriate
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
which
are
still
deﬁned
over
R
and
for
which
the
real
points
in
question
lift
to
real
points
of
the
covering,
injectivity
for
such
“stack-curves”
follows
from
injectivity
for
usual
curves
as
proven
in
Corollary
3.13.)
Finally,
the
surfaces
that
may
appear
as
ﬁbers
in
the
families
Nj+1
→
Nj
appearing
above
are
of
the
following
type:
If
C
is
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
R,
write
ΔC
⊆
C
×R
C
for
the
diagonal.
Then
the
surfaces
in
question
are
of
the
form
{(C
×R
C)\ΔC
}/S2
(where
S2
is
the
symmetric
group
on
two
letters
permuting
the
two
factors
of
C,
and
we
note
that
this
quotient
is
the
same
whether
taken
in
the
sense
of
schemes
or
of
stacks).
Now
by
passing
(as
in
the
one-dimensional
case)
to
appropriate
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
these
surfaces
which
are
still
deﬁned
over
R
and
for
which
the
real
points
in
question
lift
to
real
points
of
the
covering,
the
corresponding
injectivity
assertion
for
such
surfaces
follows
from
injectivity
for
surfaces
that
may
be
written
as
a
smooth
family
of
hyperbolic
curves
parametrized
by
a
hyperbolic
curve,
hence
is
a
consequence
of
Corollary
3.13.
Thus,
by
“dévissage”
we
conclude
the
desired
injectivity
for
(Mg,r
)R
.
Before
proceeding,
we
observe
that
the
above
argument
shows
that
the
bijectivity
assertion
of
Corollary
3.15
also
holds
for
any
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
Mg,r
which
is
deﬁned
over
R.
The
ﬁnal
statement
on
centralizers
may
be
proven
as
follows:
Given
an
involution
ιY
,
write
MY
→
(Mg,r
)R
for
the
pro-covering
deﬁned
by
the
subgroup
generated
by
ιY
in
π1alg
((Mg,r
)R
).
Then
the
statement
on
centralizers
follows
from
the
fact
that
the
conjugates
of
ιY
in
π1alg
((Mg,r
)R
)
are
in
bijective
correspondence
with
the
connected
components
of
the
inverse
images
of
Y
in
MY
(where
we
note
that
this
bijective
correspondence
follows
from
the
observation
of
the
preceding
paragraph).

Remark.
Note
that
in
many
respects
the
proﬁnite
theory
is
more
diﬃcult
and
less
elegant
than
the
discrete
theory,
where
everything
follows
easily
from
the
very
general
Lemma
3.5.
It
is
thus
the
feeling
of
the
author
that
the
discrete
theory
provides
a
more
natural
real
analogue
of
anabelian
geometry
than
the
proﬁnite
theory.
Lemma
3.16.
Let
g
≥
2,
and
let
H
⊆
Sp(2g,
Z)
be
a
subgroup
of
ﬁnite
index.
Then
there
exists
a
subgroup
H

⊆
H
which
is
normal
and
of
ﬁnite
index
in
Sp(2g,
Z)
such
that
the
cohomological
dimension
of
the
proﬁnite
completion
of
H

is
>
dimR
(Ag
)
=
2
·
dimC
(Ag
)
=
g(g
+
1).
(This
estimate
holds
even
if
one
restricts
to
H

-modules
of
order
equal
to
a
power
of
p,
for
any
ﬁxed
prime
number
p.)
In
particular,
if
g
≥
2,
then
Sp(2g,
Z)
is
not
good.
Proof.
First,
note
that
if
Sp(2g,
Z)
is
good,
then
so
is
any
subgroup
H
of
ﬁnite
index.
But
there
exist
H
such
that
if
we
write
AH

→
Ag
for
the
ﬁnite
étale
covering
deﬁned
by
a
ﬁnite
index
subgroup
H

⊆
H,
then
AH

is
a
complex
manifold
(i.e.,
not
just
a
stack).
The
cohomology
of
H

is
then
given
by
the
cohomology
of
AH

.
Moreover,
the
cohomological
dimension
of
AH

is
=
dimR
(AH

)
=
dimR
(Ag
).
Thus,
30
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
if
the
cohomological
dimension
of
the
proﬁnite
completion
of
H

is
>
dimR
(Ag
),
it
follows
that
the
cohomology
of
H

and
of
its
proﬁnite
completion
(with
coeﬃcients
in
a
ﬁnite
module)
are
not
isomorphic
in
general,
i.e.,
that
H

is
not
good.
But
this
implies
that
Sp(2g,
Z)
is
not
good,
as
desired.
Next,
let
us
assume
that
we
are
given
H
as
in
the
statement
of
Lemma
3.16,
and
prove
the
existence
of
an
H

as
stated.
First,
let
us
observe
that
since
the
congruence
subgroup
problem
has
been
resolved
aﬃrmatively
for
Sp(2g,
Z)
(cf.
[BMS]),
it
follows
that:

=
Sp(2g,
Z)∧
=
Sp(2g,
Z)
Sp(2g,
Zp
)
p
(where
the
“∧”
denotes
the
proﬁnite
completion,
and
the
product
is
taken
over
all
prime
numbers
p).
Thus,
it
follows
that
the
cohomological
dimension
of
Sp(2g,
Z)∧
is
≥
the
cohomological
dimension
of
Sp(2g,
Zp)
for
any
prime
p.
In
particular,
in
order
to
complete
the
proof
of
Lemma
3.16,
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
Sp(2g,
Zp
)
admits
a
collection
of
arbitrarily
small
normal
open
subgroups
whose
p-cohomological
dimension
is
>
g(g
+
1).
But
this
follows
from
the
theory
of
[Laz]:
Indeed,
by
[Laz],
V,
§2.2.8,
it
follows
that
that
the
p-cohomological
dimension
of
any
“p-valuable
group”
is
equal
to
the
“rank”
r
of
the
group.
Here,
a
p-valuable
group
(cf.
[Laz],
III,
§2.1.2)
is
a
topogical
group
with
a
ﬁltration
satisfying
certain
properties.
In
the
present
context,
the
topological
group
Sp[n]
(2g,
Zp
)
(i.e.,
symplectic
matrices
which
are
≡
to
the
identity
matrix
modulo
pn
),
equipped
with
the
ﬁltration
deﬁned
by
the
Sp[m]
(2g,
Zp
)
for
m
≥
n,
will
satisfy
these
properties.
Moreover,
the
rank
r
of
a
p-valuable
group
(cf.
[Laz],
III,
§2.1.1,
§2.1.3)
is
the
Qp-dimension
of
the
Lie
algebra
sp(2g,
Qp
)
of
Sp(2g,
Zp
).
Thus,
in
this
case,
r
=
dimQp
(sp(2g,
Qp
))
=
dimR
(sp(2g,
R))
=
dimR
(Sp(2g,
R))
>
dimR
(Hg
)
=
dimR
(Ag
)
(where
Hg
is
the
Siegel
upper
half-plane
—
cf.
Example
3.2).
Indeed,
the
inequality
here
follows
from
the
fact
that
Sp(2g,
R)
acts
transitively
on
Hg
,
with
positive
dimensional
isotropy
subgroups.
This
completes
the
proof.

Classes
In
this
§,
we
work
over
a
base
ﬁeld
K,
which
we
assume
(for
simplicity,
although
it
is
not
absolutely
necessary
for
much
of
what
we
shall
do)
to
be
of
characteristic
0.
Let
XK
be
a
smooth,
geometrically
connected
variety
over
K.
If
p
is
a
prime
number,
and
n
≥
1
an
integer,
then
we
may
consider
the
Kummer
sequence
on
XK
,
i.e.,
the
exact
sequence
of
sheaves
on
(XK
)et
(i.e.,
the
étale
site
of
XK
)
given
by
0
→
(Z/pn
Z)(1)
→
Gm
→
Gm
→
0
(where,
the
“(1)”
is
a
“Tate
twist,”
and
the
morphism
from
Gm
to
Gm
is
given
by
raising
to
the
pn
-th
power.)
The
connecting
morphism
induced
on
étale
cohomology
by
the
Kummer
sequence
then
gives
us
a
morphism

:
Het
(XK

Gm
)
→
Het

(Z/pn

(XK

)
Now
suppose
that
L
is
a
line
bundle
on
XK
.
Then
applying
δp,n
to
L
∈
Het

n
gives
us
a
compatible
system
of
classes
δp,n
(L)
∈

(Z/p

hence
(by

letting
p,
n
vary)
a

(XK

as

Deﬁnition

We
shall
refer
to

ﬁrst
Chern

of
L.
If
N
≥
1
is
an
integer,
then
we
shall
refer
to
2
c1

mod
N
∈
Het
(XK

(Z/NZ)(1))
as
the
(étale-theoretic)
ﬁrst
Chern
class
of
L
modulo
N
.
Next,
let
us
write
π1
(XK
)
for
the
(algebraic)
fundamental
group
of
XK
(where
we
omit
the
base-point
since
it
will
not
be
explicitly
necessary
in
our
discussion).
Also,
let
us
assume
that
we
are
given
a
quotient
π1
(XK
)

Q
(where
Q
is
proﬁnite,
and
the
surjection
is
continuous).
Then
we
make
the
following
crucial
deﬁnition:
32
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
Deﬁnition
4.2.
Let
N
≥
1
be
an
integer.
For
i,
j
∈
Z,
a
cohomology
class
i
η
∈
Het
(XK
,
(Z/NZ)(j))
will
be
called
good
if
there
exists
a
(nonempty)
ﬁnite
étale
i
covering
Y
→
XK
such
that
η|Y
∈
Het
(Y,
(Z/NZ)(j))
is
zero.
Next,
suppose
that
π1
(XK
)

Q
is
a
surjection
such
that
the
composite
of
the
natural
surjection
π1
(XK
)

ΓK
with
the
cyclotomic
character
ΓK
→
(Z/NZ)×
factors
through
Q.
Then
we
shall
say
that
η
is
Q-good
if
this
covering
Y
→
XK
may
be
chosen
to
arise
from
a
quotient
of
π1
(XK
)
that
factors
through
π1
(XK
)

Q.
If
L
is
a
line
bundle
on
XK
,
then
we
will
say
that
its
Chern
class
is
good
(respectively,
2
(XK
,
(Z/NZ)(1))
is
Q-good)
modulo
N
if
the
Chern
class
of
L
modulo
N
in
Het
good
(respectively,
Q-good).
Recall
that
a
discrete
group
Γ
is
said
to
be
good
if
the
cohomology
of
Γ
with
coeﬃcients
in
any
ﬁnite
Γ-module
is
isomorphic
(via
the
natural
morphism)
to
the
cohomology
of
the
proﬁnite
completion
of
Γ
with
coeﬃcients
in
that
module.
Then
the
justiﬁcation
for
the
terminology
of
Deﬁnition
4.2
is
the
following:
Lemma
4.3.
Suppose
that
K
is
a
subﬁeld
of
C
(the
complex
number
ﬁeld);
that
def
the
topological
space
X
=
XC
(C)
is
a
“K(π,
1)”
space
(i.e.,
its
universal
cover
is
contractible);
and
that
the
topological
fundamental
group
π1top
(X
)
is
good.
Then
it
i
follows
that
all
cohomology
classes
η
∈
Het
(XK
,
(Z/NZ)(j))
are
good.
def
def
Proof.
Write
XC
=
XK
⊗K
C,
XK
=
XK
⊗K
K.
Since
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
XC
are
always
deﬁned
over
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
K,
and
(by
well-known
elemeni
tary
properties
of
étale
cohomology)
the
natural
morphism
Het
(XK
,
(Z/NZ)(j))
→
i
Het
(XC
,
(Z/NZ)(j))
is
an
isomorphism,
one
sees
immediately
that
it
suﬃces
to
prove
Lemma
4.3
when
K
=
C,
j
=
0.
But
then
top
i
i
Het
(XC
,
Z/NZ)
∼
(XC
,
Z/NZ)
∼
=
Hsing
=
H
i
(π1
(X
),
Z/NZ)
(where
the
second
isomorphism
(between
singular
and
group
cohomology)
follows
from
the
fact
that
X
is
a
“K(π,
1)”
space).
Thus,
the
fact
that
η
vanishes
upon
restriction
to
a
(nonempty)
ﬁnite
étale
covering
follows
from
the
fact
that
π1top
(X
)
is
assumed
to
be
good.

Remark.
Thus,
under
the
hypotheses
of
Lemma
4.3,
every
cohomology
class
is
good.
In
general,
however,
we
would
like
to
work
with
varieties
XK
that
do
not
satisfy
the
hypotheses
of
Lemma
4.3,
but
which
nonetheless
have
the
property
that
the
cohomology
classes
that
we
are
interested
in
are
good.
Now
let
L
be
a
line
bundle
on
XK
.
Let
us
write
L
→
XK
for
the
geometric
line
bundle
associated
to
L
(i.e.,
the
spectrum
over
XK
of
the
symmetric
algebra
over
OXK
of
L−1
).
Also,
let
us
write
TOPICS
IN
ANABELIAN
GEOMETRY
33
L×
⊆
L
→
XK
for
the
complement
of
the
zero
section
in
L.
Thus,
L×
→
XK
is
a
Gm
-torsor,
and
we
have
an
exact
sequence
of
(algebraic)
fundamental
groups

Z(1)
=
π1
((Gm
)K
)
→
π1
(L×
)
→
π1
(XK
)
→
1
(where
we
omit
base-points
since
they
will
not
be
explicitly
necessary
in
our
discussion).
In
general,
however,
it
is
not
necessarily
the
case
that
the
ﬁrst
arrow
is
injective.
(Consider,
for
instance,
the
line
bundle
O(−1)
on
P1
(over,
say,
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
K
of
characteristic
zero),
in
which
case
L×
=
A2
\{0}
has
trivial
fundamental
group.)
Lemma
4.4.
Suppose
that
the
Chern
class
of
L
is
good
modulo
all
powers
of
p.


of
the
morphism
Z(1)
→
π1
(L×
)
is
injective,
Then
the
restriction
to
Zp
(1)
⊆
Z(1)
so
the
above
exact
sequence
deﬁnes
an
extension
class
∈
H
2
(π1
(XK
),
Zp
(1)).
If,
moreover,
the
Chern
class
of
L
is
Q-good
modulo
all
powers
of
p,
then
(for
all
integers
n
≥
1)
the
reduction
modulo
pn
of
this
extension
class
arises
from
an
element
∈
H
2
(Q,
(Z/pn
Z)(1)).
Proof.
Indeed,
let
Y
→
XK
be
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
such
that
the
Chern
class
of
L
modulo
pn
vanishes
upon
restriction
to
Y
.
Going
back
to
the
deﬁnition
of
the
Chern
class
using
the
Kummer
exact
sequence,
one
thus
sees
that
there
exists
a
line
bundle
P
on
Y
such
that
n
P
⊗p
∼
=
L|Y
.
Let
us
write
P×
→
Y
for
the
complement
of
the
zero
section
in
the
geometric
line
bundle
corresponding
to
P.
Thus,
P×
→
Y
is
a
Gm
-torsor
with
the
property
that,
if
we
execute
the
change
of
structure
group
Gm
→
Gm
given
by
def
raising
to
the
pn
-th
power,
we
obtain
the
Gm
-torsor
L×
|Y
=
L×
×XK
Y
→
Y
.
In
particular,
we
obtain
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
P×
→
L×
|Y
whose
restriction
to
the
geometric
ﬁbers
of
L×
|Y
→
Y
is
(isomorphic
to)
the
covering
of
Gm
given
by
raising
to
the
pn
-th
power.
Sorting
through
the
definitions
of
the
various
fundamental
groups
involved,
one
thus
sees
that
the
existence
of
such
coverings
implies
that
Zp
(1)
→
π1
(L×
)
is
injective,
and,
moreover,
that
if
the
covering
Y
→
XK
arises
from
a
quotient
of
Q,
then
the
extension
class
∈
H
2
(π1
(XK
),
(Z/pn
Z)(1))
deﬁned
by
π1
(L×
)
arises
from
a
class
∈
H
2
(Q,
(Z/pn
Z)(1)),
as
desired.

In
the
Q-good
portion
of
Lemma
4.4,
it
was
necessary
to
use
ﬁnite
coeﬃcients
Z/pn
Z
(i.e.,
rather
than
Zp
)
since
it
is
not
clear
that
the
various
group
extensions
of
Q
by
(Z/pn

form
a
compatible
system
as
n
varies.
(When
Q
=
π1
(XK
),
one
need
not
worry
about
this
since
one
already
has
a
natural
group
extension,
namely,
that
arising
from
π1
(L×
).)
Lemma
4.5.
Suppose
that
the
Chern
class
of
L
is
good
modulo
all
powers
of
p.
Write
2
cgp
1
(L)
∈
H
(π1
(XK
),
Zp
(1))
for
the
extension
class
of
Lemma
4.4.
Then
the
image
of

under
the
natural
map
2
H

(π1

Zp

is
equal
to
the
(p-adic
portion
of
the)
ﬁrst
Chern
class
c1
(L)
of
Deﬁnition
4.1.
If,
moreover,
the
Chern
class
of
L
is
Q-good
modulo
all
powers
of
p,
then
(for
all
integers
n
≥

there
exists
a
class
∈
H
2
(Q,
(Z/pn

whose
image
in
2
Het
(XK
,
(Z/pn
Z)(1))
is
equal
to
c1
(L)
mod
pn
.
Proof.
If
Γ
is
a
proﬁnite
group,
then
let
us
denote
by
B(Γ)
the
“classifying
site
of
Γ,”
i.e.,
the
site
deﬁned
by
considering
the
category
of
ﬁnite
sets
with
continuous
Γ-action
(and
coverings
given
by
surjections
of
such
sets).
Thus,
if
M
is
a
ﬁnite
abelian
group
with
continuous
Γ-action,
then
M
deﬁnes
a
sheaf
of
abelian
groups
on
this
site
whose
cohomology
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
usual
group
cohomology
of
Γ
with
coeﬃcients
in
M.
Next,
let
us
note
that
relative
to
this
notation,
there
is
a
tautological
morphism
(XK
)et
→
B(π1
(XK
))
determined
by
the
well-known
equivalence
between
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
XK
and
ﬁnite
sets
with
continuous
π1
(XK
)-action.
Put
another
way,
this
morphism
is
the
étale
analogue
of
the
well-known
tautological
morphism
(determined
up
to
homotopy
equivalence)
in
topology
from
a
topological
space
to
the
classifying
space
of
its
fundamental
group.
By
functoriality,
we
thus
obtain
a
commutative
diagram:
(L×
)et
⏐
⏐

−→
B(π1
(L×
))
⏐
⏐

(XK
)et
−→
B(π1

(where
the
horizontal
morphisms
are
the
tautological
morphisms
just
discussed,
and
the
vertical
morphisms
are
those
induced
by
functoriality
from
L×
→
XK
).
Next,
let
us
observe
that
both
vertical
morphisms
of
the
above
commutative
diagram
give
rise
to
Leray-Serre
spectral
sequences
on
cohomology
with
coeﬃcients
in
Zp
(1).
(Here,
we
note
that
the
fact
that
the
vertical
morphism
on
the
right
gives
TOPICS
IN
ANABELIAN
GEOMETRY
35
rise
to
such
a
spectral
sequence
follows
from
the
injectivity
assertion
of
Lemma
4.4.)
In
particular,
if
we
consider
the
diﬀerential
on
the
“E2
-term”
of
these
spectral
sequences
we
obtain
a
commutative
diagram:

Zp
=
H

(π1
(XK
),
H
1
(Z(1),
Zp
(1)))

Zp

Het
((Gm
)K
,
Zp
(1)))
⏐
⏐

−→
2
Het
(XK
,
Zp
(1))
(where
the
vertical
morphisms
are
the
diﬀerentials
of
the
spectral
sequence,
and
the
horizontal
morphisms
are
induced
by
the
morphisms
of
sites
just
discussed).
On
the
other
hand,
sorting
through
the
deﬁnitions,
one
sees
that
it
is
a
tautology
that
the
image
of
1
∈
Zp
under
the
vertical
morphism
on
the
right
(respectively,
left)
is
the
Chern
class
c1
(L)
(respectively,
cgp
1
(L)).
Thus,
the
assertion
that
the
image
of
2
cgp
(L)
in
H
(X
,
Z
(1))
is
equal
to
c1
(L)
follows
from
the
commutativity
of
the
K
p
et

above
diagram.
The
corresponding
assertion
in
the
Q-good
case
follows
by
replacing
π1
(XK
),
Zp
in
the
above
argument
by
Q,
Z/pn
Z,
respectively,
and
applying
the
Q-good
portion
of
Lemma
4.4.

Lemma
4.6.
Suppose
that
XK
is
equipped
with
a
smooth,
proper
morphism
XK
→
ZK
(where
ZK
is
a
smooth,
geometrically
connected
variety
over
K)
which
admits
a
section
σ
:
ZK
→
XK
.
Also,
let
us
assume
that
K
may
be
embedded
as
a
subﬁeld
of
C,
and
that
if
z
is
any
geometric
point
of
ZK
such
that
k(z)
may
be
embedded
as
def
a
subﬁeld
of
C,
then
the
geometric
ﬁber
Xz
=
XK
×ZK
z
satisﬁes
the
hypotheses
of
Lemma
4.3
(i.e.,
its
complex
valued
points
form
a
“K(π,
1)”
space
with
good
topological
fundamental
group).
Then
the
Chern
class
of
any
line
bundle
L
on
XK
for
which
the
pull-back
σ
∗
(L)
is
trivial
(as
a
line
bundle
on
ZK
)
is
good
modulo
all
integers
N
≥
1.
Proof.
First,
let
us
observe
that
we
may
always
replace
ZK
(respectively,
XK
)
by
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
ZK
(respectively,
XK
,
possibly
at
the
expense
of
also
replacing
ZK
by
some
new
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
ZK
)
without
aﬀecting
the
validity
of
either
the
hypotheses
or
the
conclusion
of
the
lemma.
Next,
ﬁx
a
geometric
point
z
of
Z
as
in
the
statement
of
Lemma
4.6,
and
write
Xz
for
the
resulting
geometric
ﬁber.
Then
the
existence
of
the
section
σ
implies
that
we
obtain
an
exact
sequence
of
fundamental
groups:
1
→
π1
(Xz
)
→
π1
(XK
)
→
π1
(ZK
)
→
1
Indeed,
in
general
(i.e.,
in
the
absence
of
hypothesis
that
σ
exist)
the
morphism
π1
(Xz
)
→
π1
(XK
)
need
not
be
injective.
That
is
to
say,
its
kernel
is
naturally
isomorphic
to
the
cokernel
of
the
morphism
(induced
by
XK
→
ZK
via
functoriality)
36
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
between
certain
étale-theoretic
second
homotopy
groups
of
XK
and
ZK
(cf.
[Frdl],
p.
107,
Theorem
11.5).
On
the
other
hand,
since
XK
→
ZK
admits
a
section,
it
thus
follows
(by
functoriality)
that
this
morphism
between
second
homotopy
groups
also
admits
a
section,
hence
that
it
is
surjective
(i.e.,
its
cokernel
is
trivial).
This
implies
the
injectivity
of
the
morphism
π1
(Xz
)
→
π1
(XK
).
Note
that,
stated
in
words,
the
injectivity
of
this
morphism
implies
that
(after
possible
base-change
to
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
ZK
)
any
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
Xz
may
be
realized
as
the
restriction
to
the
ﬁber
Xz
of
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
XK
.
Next,
let
us
consider
the
Leray-Serre
spectral
sequence
associated
to
the
morphism
XK
→
ZK
for
étale
cohomology
with
coeﬃcients
in
(Z/pn
Z)(1)
(for
some
p,
n
as
in
Deﬁnition
4.1).
If
we
consider
the
“E2
-term”of
this
spectral
sequence,
we
2
see
that
the
cohomology
group
Het
(XK
,
(Z/pn
Z)(1))
gets
a
natural
ﬁltration
whose
“highest
subquotient”
(i.e.,
the
subquotient
which
is,
in
fact,
a
quotient)
is
a
sub0
2
(ZK
,
Het
(Xz
,
(Z/pn
Z)(1))).
On
the
other
hand,
by
the
assumptions
module
of
Het
2
placed
on
Xz
,
it
follows
that
all
the
classes
of
Het
(Xz
,
(Z/pn
Z)(1))
vanish
upon
restriction
to
some
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
Xz
.
Moreover,
by
the
discussion
of
the
preceding
paragraph,
it
follows
that
this
covering
may
be
realized
as
the
restriction
to
Xz
of
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
XK
.
Thus,
in
conclusion,
by
replacing
XK
and
ZK
by
appropriate
ﬁnite
étale
coverings,
we
may
assume
that
the
image
of
the
class
2
c1
(L)
mod
pn
in
the
highest
subquotient
of
Het
(XK
,
(Z/pn
Z)(1))
vanishes.
2
(XK
,
(Z/pn
Z)(1))
The
next
highest
subquotient
of
the
natural
ﬁltration
on
Het
induced
by
the
Leray-Serre
spectral
sequence
may
be
regarded
naturally
as
a
sub1
1
module
of
Het
(ZK
,
Het
(Xz
,
(Z/pn
Z)(1))).
Thus,
by
an
argument
similar
to
that
of
the
preceding
paragraph,
we
conclude
that
we
may
assume
that
the
image
of
the
2
class
c1(L)
mod
pn
in
the
next
highest
subquotient
of
Het
(XK
,
(Z/pn
Z)(1))
also
vanishes.
The
next
subquotient
(i.e.,
the
subquotient
which
is,
in
fact,
a
submodule)
of
2
the
natural
ﬁltration
on
Het
(XK
,
(Z/pn
Z)(1))
induced
by
the
Leray-Serre
spec2
tral
sequence
is
given
by
the
submodule
of
Het
(XK
,
(Z/pn
Z)(1))
which
is
the
2
n
2
n
image
of
Het
(ZK
,
(Z/p
Z)(1))
in
Het
(XK
,
(Z/p
Z)(1))
(via
pull-back
relative
to
XK
→
ZK
).
Note
that
the
existence
of
the
section
σ
implies
that
this
pull-back
2
2
morphism
Het
(ZK
,
(Z/pn
Z)(1))
→
Het
(XK
,
(Z/pn
Z)(1))
is
injective.
Thus,
we
n
conclude
that
the
class
c1
(L)
mod
p
arises
as
the
pull-back
to
XK
of
a
class
in
2
Het
(ZK
,
(Z/pn
Z)(1)).
On
the
other
hand,
by
pulling
back
via
σ
(and
applying
the
functoriality
of
the
formation
of
the
Chern
class
of
a
line
bundle),
we
thus
see
that
2
this
class
in
Het
(ZK
,
(Z/pn
Z)(1))
is
simply
c1(σ∗
(L))
mod
pn
,
which
is
=
0
(since
σ
∗
(L)
is
assumed
to
be
trivial).
This
completes
the
proof
of
Lemma
4.6.

§4.2.
The
Group-Theoreticity
of
a
Certain
Chern
Class
In
this
§,
we
let
K
be
a
ﬁeld
of
characteristic
0
(until
further
notice).
Also,
we
ﬁx
a
prime
number
p
and
an
integer
g
≥
2.
Let
us
denote
by
A
the
moduli
stack
of
principally
polarized
abelian
varieties
of
dimension
g.
Write
TOPICS

G→A
for
the
tautological
abelian
scheme
over
A,
and

:
A
→
G
for
its
identity
section.
Also,
let
us
denote
by
LG
the
tautological
line
bundle
on
G
that
deﬁnes
the
principal
polarization.
Thus,
LG
is
relatively
ample
over
A,
and
we
assume
that
it
is
rigidiﬁed
by
some
isomorphism
∗
(LG
)
∼
=
OA
.
Also,
we
ﬁx
a
geometric
point
a
∈
A(K),
and
denote
the
fundamental
group
π1
(Ga
)
of
the
geometric
ﬁber
Ga
by
π1
(G/A).
Thus,
we
obtain
an
exact
sequence
of
fundamental
groups
1
→
π1
(G/A)
→
π1
(G)
→
π1
(A)
→
1
equipped
with
a
section
π1
()
:
π1
(A)
→
π1
(G)
which
allows
us
to
identify
π1
(G)
with
the
semi-direct
product
π1
(G/A)

π1
(A).
Next,
observe
that
since
π1
(G/A)

is
a
free
Z-module
of
rank
2g,
we
may
write
(p)
(=p)
π1
(G/A)
=
ΠG/A
×
ΠG/A
for
the
natural
decomposition
of
π1
(G/A)
as
a
product
of
a
Zp
-free
module
—
i.e.,
(p)
(=p)
ΠG/A
—
and
a
module
ΠG/A
which
is
free
over
the
product
of
all
Zp
,
where
p
ranges
over
the
prime
numbers
not
equal
to
p.
Moreover,
the
above
exact
sequence
shows
that
π1
(A)
acts
naturally
on
π1
(G/A)
in
a
way
that
respects
this
decomposition.
In
particular,
we
may
push
forward
the
above
exact
sequence
via
the
quotient
(p)
(p/A)
π1
(G/A)

ΠG/A
to
obtain
exact
sequences
(where
ΠG
is
deﬁned
by
the
ﬁrst
exact
sequence)
(=p)
(p/A)
1
→
ΠG/A
→
π1
(G)
→
ΠG
(p)
(p/A)
1
→
ΠG/A
→
ΠG

→
π1
(A)

1
—
of
which
the
second
exact
sequence
admits
a
section
that
allows
us
to
identify
(p/A)
(p)
with
the
semi-direct
product
ΠG/A

π1
(A).
ΠG
Now
let
us
consider
π1
(A)
in
greater
detail.
First,
let
us
recall
that
the
action
of
(p)
π1
(A)
on
ΠG/A
preserves
the
symplectic
form
deﬁned
by
the
tautological
principal
polarization
on
the
family
of
abelian
varieties
G
→
A
up
to
multiplication
by
a
scalar.
Let
us
denote
by
(p)
GSp(ΠG/A
)
(p)
the
group
of
Zp
-linear
automorphisms
of
ΠG/A
which
preserve
this
symplectic
form
up
to
multiplication
by
a
scalar.
Thus,
we
obtain
a
natural
commutative
diagram
(in
which
the
rows
are
exact):

Here,
“Sp”
denotes
the
group
of
Z-linear
automorphisms
of
π1

that
preserve
(p)
the
symplectic
form
in
question
precisely;
the
homomorphism
GSp(ΠG/A

Zp

is
the
map
that
assigns
to
an
element
of
the
domain
the
scalar
by
which
this
element
acts
on
the
symplectic
form
in
question.
(Also,
we
note
that
here,
we
apply
the
well-known
facts
that:
(i.)
when
K
=
C,
the
topological
fundamental
group
of
A
is
equal
to
Sp(2g,
Z);
(ii.)
for

the

problem
for
Sp(2g,
Z)
has
been
resolved
aﬃrmatively
(cf.
the
proof
of
Lemma
3.16;
[BMS]).)
Finally,
we
observe
that
the
vertical
morphism
(on
the
right)
ΓK
→
Zp
×
is
simply
the
cyclotomic
character
of
K.
(p/A)
In
particular,
by
applying
the
identiﬁcation
of
ΠG
with
the
semi-direct
(p)
product
ΠG/A

π1
(A),
we
obtain
a
continuous
homomorphism
(p/A)
ΠG
(p)
def

ΠG
(p)
(p)
=


GSp(ΠG/A
)
which
is
surjective
whenever
the

ΓK

is
surjective.
As
is
well-known
(cf.,
e.g.,
[Ser3],
Chapter
XIV,
§7),
this
is
the
case,
for
instance,
when
K
=
Q,
Qp
.
In
the
present
discussion,
we
would
like
to
concentrate
our
attention
on
the
prime
p,
in
the
case
K
=
Q.
Thus,
we
have
surjections:
(p/A)
π1


ΠG
(p)

ΠG
Let
us
denote
(by
abuse
of
notation
relative

the
p-adic
component
of
the
ﬁrst
Chern
class
of
LG
by:

(G,

c1

Then
we
have

(cf.

the

(G,

Proof.
Indeed,
Lemma
4.7
follows
from
Lemmas
4.4,
4.5,
together
with
the
proof
of
Lemma
4.6
(where,
in
Lemma
4.6,
we
take
“G
→
A”
as
our
smooth,
proper
morphism
“XK
→
ZK
”).
In
fact,
if
we
apply
Lemmas
4.4,
4.5,
4.6,
literally
as
stated,
we
already
obtain
that
c1
(LG
)
arises
from
a
class
∈
H
2
(π1
(G),
Zp
(1)).
Since
(p/A)
(=p)
the
kernel
of
the
surjection
π1
(G)

ΠG
is
equal
to
ΠG/A
,
which
is
a
proﬁnite
group
of
order
prime
to
p,
it
thus
follows
immediately
that
this
class
arises
from
(p/A)
a
class
∈
H
2
(ΠG
,
Zp
(1)).
To
see
that,
in
fact,
c1
(LG
)
mod
pn
arises
from
a
(p)
class
∈
H
2
(ΠG
,
(Z/pn
Z)(1)),
it
suﬃces
to
observe
that,
in
the
proof
of
Lemma
4.6,
the
only
coverings
of
G
that
were
necessary
to
annihilate
c1
(LG
)
modulo
pn
were
coverings
of
G
that
restricted
to
arbitrary
p-power
coverings
of
the
abelian
(p)
variety
Ga
.
But
it
is
clear
from
the
deﬁnition
of
ΠG
(cf.
the
discussion
above)
that
(p/A)
such
coverings
may
be
constructed
from
quotients
of
ΠG
that
factor
through
(p/A)
(p)
the
quotient
ΠG

ΠG
.
Thus,
we
conclude
by
taking
“Q”
to
be
the
quotient
(p)
π1
(G)

ΠG
in
Lemmas
4.4,
4.5.
This
completes
the
proof
of
Lemma
4.7.

Next,
let
us
denote
by
Δ
a
copy
of
the
maximal
pro-p
quotient
of
the
proﬁnite
completion
of
the
fundamental
group
of
a
(Riemann)
surface
of
genus
g.
Since,
as
is
well-known
(cf.,
e.g.,
[Tama1],
Proposition
1.11),
Δ
is
center-free,
we
have
an
exact
sequence
of
proﬁnite
groups:
def
def
1
→
Δ
→
AΔ
=
Aut(Δ)
→
OΔ
=
Out(Δ)
→
1
If
we
form
the
quotient
AΔ
of
AΔ
by
the
kernel
of
the
quotient
Δ

Δab
(to
the
maximal
abelian
quotient
of
Δ),
then
we
obtain
a
natural
commutative
diagram
(in
which
the
rows
are
exact):

OΔ

In
particular,
we
obtain
a
natural
action
of
OΔ
on
Δab
which
preserves
the
natural
symplectic
form
on
Δab
—
i.e.,
the
symplectic
form
determined
by
the
cup
product
on
group
cohomology
H

(Δ,
Zp
)
×
H

(where
we
think

ab
of
H
(Δ,

)
as
the
Zp
-linear
dual
to
Δ
)
—
up
to
multiplication
by
a
scalar.
Let
us
denote
by
GSp(Δab)
the
group
of
Zp
-linear
automorphisms
of
Δab
which
preserve
this
symplectic
form
up
to
multiplication
by
a
scalar.
Thus,
we
obtain
a
natural
homomorphism

OΔ

together
with
an
OΔ
-equivariant
action
of
Δab
on
AΔ
(via
the
inclusion
Δab

AΔ
),
which
determines
an
isomorphism
of
proﬁnite
groups
(Δab

OΔ
)
×OΔ
AΔ
∼
=
AΔ
×OΔ
AΔ
—
i.e.,
in
more
“geometric
language,”
AΔ
is
a
“Δab-torsor”
over
OΔ
.
In
particular,
by
applying
this
isomorphism,
we
obtain
a
natural
projection:
AΔ
×OΔ
AΔ
→
(Δab

OΔ)
→
(Δab

GSp(Δab
))
Moreover,
any
choice
of
symplectic
isomorphism
Δab
∼
=
ΠG/A
determines
an
isomorphism
(p)
(p)
(Δab

GSp(Δab
))
∼
=
ΠG
which,
up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism,
is
independent
of
our
choice
of
symplectic
isomorphism.
In
a
similar
vein,
let
us
write
M
for
the
moduli
stack
of
smooth,
proper
curves
of
genus
g
over
K,
and
C→M
for
the
tautological
curve
over
M.
Also,
let
us
write
J
→
M
for
the
Jacobian
of
C
→
M
and
(for
d
∈
Z)
Jd
→
M
for
the
J
-torsor
over
M
that
parametrizes
line
bundles
on
C
of
relative
degree
d
over
M.
By
assigning
to
a
point
of
the
curve
C
the
line
bundle
on
C
deﬁned
by
that
point
(regarded
as
an
eﬀective
divisor),
we
obtain
a
natural
morphism:
C

J1
Moreover,
the
action
of
J
on
J1
determines
an

J

J1
∼
=
J1
×M
J1
hence
also
a

In

by

we
obtain
a

A
Generalization
of
the
Main
Result
of
[Mzk2]
In
this
§,
we
maintain
the
notation
of
§4.2,
except
that
we
again
allow
K
to
be
an
arbitrary
ﬁeld
of
characteristic
0
(until
further
notice).
Let
us
assume
that
we
are
given
two
hyperbolic
curves
X1
,
X2
of
type
(g,
r)
over
K.
For
i
=
1,
2,
let
us
write
π1
((Xi
)K
)

Π(Xi
)
for
the
maximal
pro-Σ
K
quotient
of
π1
((Xi
)K
),
and
π1
(Xi
)

ΠXi
for
the
quotient
of
π1
(Xi
)
by
the
kernel
of
π1
((Xi
)K
)

Π(Xi
)
.
Thus,
for
i
=
1,
2,
we
obtain
exact
sequences:
K
1
→
Π(Xi
)
→
ΠXi
→
ΓK
→

K
Next,
let
us
assume
that
we
are
given
an
isomorphism
α
:
ΠX1
∼
=
ΠX2
which
preserves
and
induces
the
identity
on
the
quotients
ΠXi

ΓK
.
Thus,
α
induces
isomorphisms:

Denote
the

Proof.
Assume
(without
loss
of
generality)
that
X(K)
is
nonempty.
Then
we
may
think
of
JX
as
the
Albanese
variety
associated
to
X.
Write
λ
:
X
→
JX
for
the
morphism
exhibiting
JX
as
the
Albanese
variety
of
X.
Then
(by
the
universal
property
of
the
Albanese
variety)
δσ
necessarily
factors
through
λ,
inducing
a
morphism
δσλ
:
JX
→
JX
which
is
nonconstant
if
and
only
if
δσ
is
nonconstant.
On
the
other
hand,
δσλ
is
easily
computed
to
be
(up
to
composition
with
a
translation)
equal
to
the
morphism
1
−
Jσ
,
where
Jσ
is
the
automorphism
induced
on
JX
by
σ.
Thus,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
Jσ
is
not
equal
to
the
identity.
But
this
follows
again
(formally)
from
the
universal
property
of
the
Albanese
variety.

Corollary

Suppose
that
r
=
0.
Then
for
i
=
1,
2,
there
exist
ample
2
(X1
,
Zp

maps
to

bundles

on

with
the
property
that

(P1
)
∈
Het

.
c1
(P2
)
∈
Het
(X2
,
Zp
(1))
under
αHet
Proof.
First,
let
us
observe
that
by
replacing
the
Xi
by
ﬁnite
étale
Galois
coverings
that
correspond
via
α,
we
may
assume
(without
loss
of
generality)
that
Xi
admits
a
K-automorphism
σi
such
that
σ1
,
σ2
correspond
via
α.
Indeed,
once
the
necessary
line
bundles
are
deﬁned
over
these
coverings,
one
obtains
line
bundles
on
the
original
curves
with
the
desired
properties
by
simply
“taking
the
norm”
of
the
line
bundles
on
the
coverings.
Since
Xi
deﬁnes
a
classifying
morphism
κi
:
Spec(K)
→
M,
we
let
Pi
be
the
pull-back
(where
we
note
that
Xi
=
C
×M,κi
Spec(K))
of
the
line
bundle
LC×M
C
of
Corollary
4.8
to
Xi
×K
Xi
.
Moreover,
by
Lemma
4.9,
it
follows
that
the
pull-back
Pi
of
Pi
via
the
morphism
(1,
σi
)
:
Xi
→
Xi
×K
Xi
given
by
the
product
of
the
identity
and
the
automorphism
σ
is
ample
on
Xi
.
Now
let
us
consider
the
homomorphism
on
fundamental
groups
(well-deﬁned
up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism)
ΠXi
→
ΠC
induced
by
κi
.
Note
that
the
composite
ΠXi
→
AΔ
of
this
homomorphism
with
the
natural
homomorphism
ΠC
→
AΔ
of
§4.2
may
be
constructed
entirely
group-theoretically
(from
the
action
by
conjugation
of
ΠXi
on
its
normal
subgroup
Π(Xi
)
).
Thus,
in
particular,
it
follows
that
(for
i
=
1,
2)
these
K
composites
are
compatible
with
α.
This
compatibility
implies
that
the
composite
of
the
homomorphism
ΠXi
×ΓK
ΠXi
→
ΠC
×ΠM
ΠC
(induced
by
κi
)
with
the
homomorphism
ΠC
×ΠM
ΠC
→
AΔ
×OΔ
AΔ
of
§4.2
is
a
homomorphism
44
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
ΠXi
×ΓK
ΠXi
→
AΔ
×OΔ
AΔ
which
is
compatible
with
α.
Thus,
it
follows
formally
from
Corollary
4.8
that
the
Chern
classes
of
the
Pi
correspond
via
α.
Since
the
pull-back
via
“(1,
σi
)”
may
also
be
deﬁned
entirely
group-theoretically,
we
thus
conclude
that
the
Chern
classes
of
the
Pi
correspond
via
α,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
Corollary
4.10.

We
are
now
ready
to
state
and
prove
the
main
result
of
the
present
§4:
Deﬁnition
4.11.
We
shall
say
that
K
is
generalized
sub-p-adic
if
K
may
be
embedded
as
a
subﬁeld
of
a
ﬁnitely
generated
extension
of
the
quotient
ﬁeld
of
W
(Fp
)
(the
ring
of
Witt
vectors
with
coeﬃcients
in
the
algebraic
closure
of
Fp
).
Remark.
Note
that
sub-p-adic
ﬁelds
are
always
generalized
sub-p-adic.
On
the
other
hand,
ﬁelds
such
as
the
maximal
algebraic
extension
of
Q
which
is
unramiﬁed
over
p
are
generalized
sub-p-adic,
but
not
sub-p-adic.
Remark.
Suppose
that
K
is
generalized
sub-p-adic,
where
p
∈
Σ.
Then
note
that
even
if
we
do
not
know
a
priori
that
the
hyperbolic
curves
X1
,
X2
are
of
the
same
type
(g,
r),
the
mere
existence
of
an
isomorphism
α
:
ΠX1
∼
=
ΠX2
(which
preserves
and
induces
the
identity
on
the
quotients
ΠXi

ΓK
)
already
implies
that
X1
and
X2
are
of
the
same
type.
Indeed,
to
see
this,
we
reduce
immediately
to
the
case
where
K
is
ﬁnite
over
the
quotient
ﬁeld
of
W
(Fp
)
and
then
consider
the
dimension
of
the
weight
0
portion
of
the
Hodge-Tate
decomposition
of
the
maximal
pro-p
abelian
quotient
of
Π(Xi
)
.
This
dimension
gives
back
the
K
genus
g;
then
r
may
be
recovered
from
the
fact
that
Π(Xi
)
is
free
on
2g
+
r
−
1
K
generators
(respectively,
not
free)
if
r
>
0
(respectively,
r
=
0).
Thus,
there
is
no
loss
of
generality
in
assuming
(as
we
did
in
the
above
discussion)
that
the
Xi
are
of
the
same
“type”
(g,
r).
Theorem
4.12.
(Isomorphism

Suppose
that
K
is
a
generalized
sub-p-adic
ﬁeld,
where
p
∈
Σ.
Let
X1
,
X2
be
hyperbolic

over
K.
Let
us
write
Isom(X1

)
for
the
set

and

is
bijective.
Remark.
One
formal
consequence
of
Theorem
4.12
(cf.
[Mzk2],
Theorem
C)
is
the
following:
If
K
is
generalized
sub-p-adic,
and
M
denotes
the
moduli
stack
of
hyperbolic
curves
of
type
(g,
r)
over
K,
then
the
natural
morphism
M(K)
→
SectΓK
(ΓK
,
ΠM
)
is
injective.
(Here,
ΠM
is
as
deﬁned
in
§4.2
(where
we
note
that
the
same
formal
deﬁnition
can
be
made
even
in
the
case
r
>
0),
and
“SectΓK
(ΓK
,
ΠM
)”
is
the
set
of
sections
of
the
projection
ΠM

ΓK
considered
up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
of
ΠM
arising
from
ΠM
.)
K
Proof.
In
a
word,
once
one
has
Corollary
4.10,
the
proof
of
Theorem
4.12
is
entirely
similar
to
the
proof
of
Theorem
A
in
[Mzk2],
so
we
will
only
sketch
details.
First,
we
reduce
immediately
to
the
case
where
K
is
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
the
quotient
ﬁeld
of
W
(Fp
)
(cf.
Lemmas
4.13,
4.14,
below;
[Mzk2],
§15),
and
X1
,
X2
are
proper
of
genus
g
(cf.
[Mzk2],
proof
of
Theorem
14.1).
Now,
the
main
idea
of
the
proof
is
to
replace
the
portion
of
the
proof
of
[Mzk2]
given
in
[Mzk2],
§1
–
6,
by
Corollary
4.10,
by
using
the
following
argument.
First,
(for
i
=
1,
2)
let
us
write
def
2
Hi
=
Het
(Xi
,
Qp(1))
and
Gi
⊆
Hi
for
the
geometric
part
of
Hi
,
i.e.,
the
Qp
-subspace
generated
by
ﬁrst
Chern
classes
of
line
bundles
on
Xi
.
Also,
let
us
write
Ji
for
the
Jacobian
of
Xi
,
and
T
(Ji
)
for
its
associated
p-adic
Tate
module.
Note
that
α
induces
an
isomorphism
αH
:
H1
∼
=
H2
.
Also,
let
us
observe
that
since
K
has
cohomological
dimension
1
(cf.
Lemma
4.13
below),
applying
the
Leray-Serre
spectral
sequence
(for
Galois
(p)
cohomology
with
coeﬃcients
in
Qp
(1))
to
the
surjection
ΠXi

ΓK
gives
rise
to
an
exact
sequence:
0
→
H
1
(K,
T
(Ji
)
⊗
Qp)
→
Hi
→
Qp
→
0
(where
the
“T
(Ji
)”
on
the
left
should,
strictly
speaking,
be
the
Cartier
dual
of
T
(Ji
),
but
we
identify
T
(Ji
)
with
its
Cartier
dual
via
the
standard
principal
polarization
on
the
Jacobian
Ji
;
the
“Qp”
on
the
right
arises
from
the
isomorphism
(p)
H
0
(K,
H

(Π(Xi
)
,
Qp(1))
∼
=
Qp
deﬁned
by
the
“degree
map”).
K
46
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
Now
I
claim
that
αH
(G1
)
=
G2
.
Indeed,
by
Corollary
4.10,
there
exists
a
line
bundle
Pi
of
nonzero
degree
on
Xi
such
that
αH
(c1
(P1
))
=
c1(P2
).
Thus,
to
show
that
αH
(G1
)
=
G2
,
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
αH
preserves
ﬁrst
Chern
classes
of
line
bundles
of
degree
0.
Since
we
are
working
over
Qp
,
we
may
always
replace
K
by
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
K
without
aﬀecting
the
validity
of
the
claim.
In
particular,
we
may
assume
that
the
Xi
have
semi-stable
reduction
over
K.
Write
Ji
for
the
unique
semi-abelian
scheme
over
OK
whose
generic
ﬁber
is
Ji
.
Now
if
Li
is
a
line
bundle
of
degree
0
on
Xi
,
it
deﬁnes
a
point
[Li
]
∈
Ji
(K),
hence,
by
Kummer
theory
(i.e.,
considering
the
obstruction
to
the
p-power
divisibility
of
[Li
]
—
cf.
[Mzk2],
§6,
the
discussion
following
Deﬁnition
6.1),
determines
an
element
κ(Li
)
∈
H
1
(K,
T
(Ji
)⊗Qp
).
If
we
regard
this
Galois
cohomology
group
as
a
subspace
of
Hi
via
the
exact
sequence
of
the
preceding
paragraph,
then
this
class
κ(Li
)
coincides
with
the
ﬁrst
Chern
class
c1
(Li
)
of
Li
(cf.
[Mzk2],
the
Remark
preceding
Deﬁnition
6.2).
On
the
other
hand,
if
[L1
]
∈
J1
(K)
arises
from
a
point
∈
J1
(OK
)
which
is
equal
to
the
zero
section
modulo
mK
,
then
κ(L1
)
corresponds,
via
α,
to
κ(L2
)
for
some
degree
0
line
bundle
L2
on
X2
deﬁned
by
a
point
∈
J2
(OK
)
(which
will
also
be
equal
to
the
zero
section
modulo
mK
).
Indeed,
this
follows
by
applying
“Tate’s
theorem”
(cf.
[Tate],
Theorem
4)
as
in
the
argument
of
the
proof
of
[Mzk2],
Theorem
7.4,
to
the
p-divisible
groups
deﬁned
by
the
formal
groups
associated
to
J1
,
J2
.
Moreover,
for
any
point
∈
J1
(K)
it
follows
from
the
fact
that
Fp
=
OK
/mK
is
a
union
of
ﬁnite
ﬁelds
that
some
nonzero
multiple
of
this
point
arises
from
a
point
∈
J1
(OK
)
which
is
equal
to
the
zero
section
modulo
mK
.
Thus,
since
we
are
working
with
Qp
-coeﬃcients,
we
thus
conclude
that
αH
maps
the
Qp-subspace
of
H1
generated
by
ﬁrst
Chern
classes
of
line
bundles
of
degree
0
onto
the
corresponding
subspace
of
H2
.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
claim.
Before
proceeding,
we
note
here
that
the
argument
of
the
preceding
paragraph
is
the
only
place
in
this
proof
where
we
use
that
the
original
base
ﬁeld
is
a
subﬁeld
of
a
ﬁnitely
generated
extension
of
the
quotient
ﬁeld
of
W
(Fp
)
—
i.e.,
as
opposed
to
W
(k),
where
we
permit
k
to
be
an
arbitrary
perfect
ﬁeld
of
characteristic
p.
The
arguments
to
be
used
in
the
remainder
of
the
proof
are
valid
for
Fp
replaced
by
an
arbitrary
such
k.
Also,
we
remark
here
that
(not
surprisingly)
the
portion
of
the
argument
of
[Mzk2]
that
corresponds
to
what
was
done
in
the
preceding
paragraph
is
given
in
[Mzk2],
§1
–
6,
where
it
was
necessary,
especially
for
the
arguments
of
[Mzk2],
Lemma
4.1,
§6,
to
assume
that
the
residue
ﬁeld
be
ﬁnite
(i.e.,
not
an
arbitrary
perfect
ﬁeld
of
characteristic
p).
Now
that
we
know
that
α
preserves
(up
to
Qp-coeﬃcients)
ﬁrst
Chern
classes
of
line
bundles
over
ﬁnite
extensions
of
K,
the
rest
of
the
argument
of
[Mzk2]
goes
through
without
much
change.
Namely,
[Mzk2],
Proposition
7.4,
follows
by
the
same
argument
as
that
given
in
loc.
cit.
(except
that
instead
of
working
over
a
K
which
is
ﬁnite
over
Qp
as
in
loc.
cit.,
we
work
over
the
present
“K,”
which
is
ﬁnite
over
the
quotient
ﬁeld
of
W
(Fp
)).
We
remark
that
in
the
present
context,
it
is
not
necessary
to
distinguish
between
“F
-geometricity”
and
“F
I-geometricity”
as
was
done
in
[Mzk2],
since
we
are
working
with
proper
curves
to
begin
with
(cf.
the
Remark
at
the
end
of
[Mzk2],
§7).
Then
[Mzk2],
§8,
goes
through
without
change
(except
that
the
ﬁnite
ﬁeld
“k”
is
to
be
replaced
by
Fp
).
The
convergence
arguments
of
[Mzk2],
§9,
10,
are
entirely
valid
when
k
is
any
perfect
ﬁeld
of
characteristic
p,
TOPICS

so
no
changes
are
necessary
in
these
two
§’s.
[Mzk2],
§11,
is
unnecessary
in
the
present
context
since
we
are
working
with
proper
curves
to
begin
with.
Finally,
the
arguments
of
[Mzk2],
§12
–
14,
go
through
without
essential
change
(except
that
they
are
much
easier
in
the
present
context
since
we
are
working
with
proper
curves
to
begin
with).
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
bijectivity
assertion
of
Theorem
4.12
(cf.
[Mzk2],
Corollary
14.2).

Remark.
Thus,
Theorem
4.12
states
(roughly)
that
the
isomorphism
class
of
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
the
quotient
ﬁeld
of
W
(Fp
)
may
be
recovered
from
the
outer
action
of
the
Galois
group
on
its
geometric
fundamental
group.
In
particular,
one
need
not
make
use
of
Gal(Fp
/Fp
)
(as
was
done
in
[Mzk2]).
In
this
sense,
Theorem
4.12
is
reminiscent
of
the
main
results
of
[Tama2],
which
state
that
in
certain
cases,
the
isomorphism
class
of
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
Fp
is
completely
determined
by
the
isomorphism
class
of
its
geometric
fundamental
group
(cf.
the
results
of
[Tama1],
which
make
essential
use
of
the
action
of
Gal(Fp
/Fp
)).
It
would
be
interesting
to
see
if
the
relationship
between
Theorem
4.12
and
[Tama2]
could
be
understood
more
explicitly.
Remark.
Another
interesting
aspect
of
Theorem
4.12
is
the
following:
Note
that,
if
K
is
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
the
quotient
ﬁeld
of
W
(Fp
),
then
its
absolute
Galois
group
ΓK
has
cohomological
dimension
1
(cf.
Lemma
4.13
below).
On
the
other
hand,
if
X
is
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
K,
then
ΠX
has
cohomological
dimension
2.
K
Thus,
the
cohomological
dimension
of
ΠX
is
equal
to
3.
Since,
roughly
speaking,
Theorem
4.12,
states
that
the
structure
of
X
is
determined
by
ΠX
,
Theorem
4.12
is
reminiscent
of
the
rigidity
theorem
of
Mostow-Prasad
for
hyperbolic
manifolds
of
real
dimension
3
(cf.
the
discussion
of
[Mzk4],
Introduction,
§0.10,
2.2.3,
2.2.6).
The
following
Lemma
is,
in
essence,
well-known:
Lemma
4.13.
Let
K
be
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
the
quotient
ﬁeld
of
W
(Fp
).
Then
ΓK
is
center-free
and
has
cohomological
dimension
equal
to
1.
Proof.
First,
write
L
for
the
quotient
ﬁeld
of
W
(Fp
),
and
L
for
the
union
(inside
L)
of
the
quotient
ﬁelds
of
the
W
(k),
as
k
ranges
over
all
ﬁnite
extensions
of
Fp
.
Then
the
ring
of
integers
OL
of
L
is
the
union
of
the
W
(k),
hence
stictly
henselian.
Moreover,
since
OL
=
W
(Fp
)
is
the
p-adic
completion
of
OL
,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
general
theory
of
henselian
rings
that
ΓL
=
ΓL
.
In
particular,
since
K
is
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
L,
it
follows
that
there
exists
a
ﬁnite
extension
K

of
L
such
that
K
=
L
⊗L
K

.
Moreover,
since
OK

is
strictly
henselian,
with
completion
equal
to
OK
,
we
have
ΓK
=
ΓK

.
Thus,
it
suﬃces
to
prove
that
ΓK

is
center-free
and
of
cohomological
dimension
equal
to
1.
In
the
remainder
of
the
proof,
to
simplify
notation,
we
shall
simply
write
K
for
K

.
Next,
observe
that
by
considering
the
maximal
tamely
ramiﬁed
extension
K
tm
of
K,
we
obtain
an
exact
sequence
48
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
1
→
ΓK
tm
→
ΓK
→
Zl
(1)
→
1
l=p
(where
the
product
ranges
over
all
prime
numbers
not
equal
to
p).
Moreover,
let
us
recall
that
ΓK
tm
is
a
pro-p-group
which
is
center-free
and
of
cohomological
dimension
1
(cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk2],
the
proof
of
Lemma
15.6).
We
thus
obtain
immediately
that
ΓK
is
of
cohomological
dimension
1.
To
show
that
ΓK
is
center-free,
it
sufﬁces
to
show
Gal(K
tm
/K)
acts
faithfully
on
Γab
K
tm
⊗
Qp
(where
“ab”
denotes
the
maximal
abelian
quotient).
But
this
may
be
done
as
follows:
Let
K0
⊆
K
be
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
such
that
K/K0
is
unramiﬁed.
Thus,
it
follows
that
K
tm
is
also
the
maximal
unramiﬁed
extension
of
K0
,
so
Gal(K
tm
/K)
→
Gal(K
tm
/K0
).
Now
let
L0
/K0
be
a
ﬁnite,
Galois,
totally
tamely
ramiﬁed
extension
of
K0
.
Then
L0
⊆
K
tm
,
so
we
obtain
a
surjection:
ab
wild
⊗
Qp
Γab
K
tm
⊗
Qp

(ΓL0
)
(where
the
superscript
“wild”
denotes
the
wild
inertia
subgroup).
But
by
the
class
wild
ﬁeld
theory
of
ﬁnite
extensions
of
Qp
,
one
knows
that
(Γab
⊗
Qp
is
naturally
L0
)
isomorphic
(via
the
p-adic
logarithm
—
cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk5],
§2)
to
L0
,
so
the
action
wild
⊗
Qp
is
faithful.
Since
arbitrary
ﬁnite
quotients
of
of
Gal(L0
/K0
)
on
(Γab
L0
)
tm
Gal(K
/K)
may
be
realized
as
“Gal(L0
/K0
)’s”
for
appropriate
choices
of
K0
,
L0
,
it
thus
follows
that
Gal(K
tm
/K)
acts
faithfully
on
Γab
K
tm
⊗
Qp
,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
Lemma
4.13.

Lemma
4.14.
Let
K
be
generalized
sub-p-adic.
Then
ΓK
is
center-free.
Proof.
Let
K
be
an
arbitrary
generalized
sub-p-adic
ﬁeld.
If
XL
is
any
hyperbolic
curve
of
type
(g,
r)
over
a
ﬁnite
extension
L
of
K,
and
σ
∈
Z(ΓK
)
(i.e.,
the
center
of
ΓK
),
then
we
have
an
isomorphism
Π(XL
)K
∼
=
Π(XL
)σ
K
(induced
by
conjugating
by
σ)
which
is
compatible
with
the
outer
actions
of
ΓL
on
both
sides.
With
this
observation
in
hand,
it
follows
that
Lemma
4.14
may
be
derived
from
Lemma
4.13
by
means
of
Theorem
4.12
using
exactly
the
same
argument
as
that
used
to
derive
[Mzk2],
Lemma
15.8,
from
[Mzk2],
Lemma
15.6,
by
means
of
[Mzk2],
Corollary
15.3.
