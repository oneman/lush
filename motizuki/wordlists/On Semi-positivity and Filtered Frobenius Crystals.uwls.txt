Introduction
The
purpose
of
this
paper
is
to
prove
that
certain
subquotients
of
the
MF
∇
-objects
of
Faltings
([1])
are
semi-positive.
In
particular,
we
obtain
an
algebraic
proof
of
a
result
(generalizing
those
of
[5],
[9])
on
the
semi-positivity
of
the
higher
direct
images
of
certain
kinds
of
sheaves
for
semistable
families
of
algebraic
varieties.
Our
Main
Theorem,
proven
in
§3,
is
as
follows:
Theorem
3.4:
Let
f
:
(X,
E)
→
(S,
D)
be
a
semistable
family
of
varieties
of
relative
dimension
d,
with
S
a
smooth,
proper
scheme
over
a
ﬁeld
L
of
characteristic
zero.
Let
(A,
∇A
,
F
i
(A))
be
a
globally
crystalline
ﬁltered
vector
bundle
with
connection
on
(X,
E).
Then
for
any
nonnegative
integer
α,
the
coherent
sheaf
of
OS
-modules
Rα
f∗
(ωX/S
⊗OX
(A/F
1
(A))∨
)
is
a
semi-positive
vector
bundle,
as
are
all
of
its
tensor
powers.
(The
term
“semistable”
(respectively,
“globally
crystalline”)
is
deﬁned
in
§1
(respectively,
§3).)
In
particular,
this
Theorem
implies
the
following:
Corollary
3.5:
Let
f
:
(X,
E)
→
(S,
D)
be
as
above.
Then
for
any
nonnegative
integer
α,
the
coherent
sheaf
of
OS
-modules
α
f∗
((Ωlog
X/S
)
)
is
a
semi-positive
vector
bundle,
as
are
all
of
its
tensor
powers.
Thus,
Fujita
and
Kawamata
proved
the
above
Corollary
in
the
case
α
=
d.

Roughly
speaking,
the
idea
of
the
proof
is
as
follows.
We
restrict
to
a
curve,
and
consider
the
possibility
of
quotients
of
the
bundle
in
question
that
have
negative
degree.
If
such
a
quotient
did
exist,
it
would
mean
that
we
could
construct
a
large
number
of
sections
of
a
space
of
bounded
dimension.
This
concludes
the
proof.
Since
the
proof
is
substantially
simpler
and
less
high-powered
in
the
case
when
the
ﬁbres
of
f
,
as
well
as
the
base
S,
are
one-dimensional
and
the
ﬁltered
vector
bundle
is
trivial,
we
present
the
proof
in
that
special
case
in
an
Appendix
(which
is
logically
independent
of
the
rest
of
the
paper,
except
for
basic
facts
and
deﬁnitions
given
in
§1).
We
believe
that
this
special
case
sheds
light
on
the
general
case.
In
essence,
what
makes
the
proof
easier
in
this
case
is
the
fact
that
we
have
a
very
physical
and
concrete
realization
of
1-motives
and
Hodge
theory
(for
trivial
coeﬃcients),
namely,
the
theory
of
semiabelian
schemes
and
the
Picard
group.
It
is
the
lack
of
such
explicit
tools
in
the
higher-dimensional
case
with
nontrivial
coeﬃcients
that
requires
one,
if
one
is
to
carry
out
an
analogous
proof,
to
employ
more
abstract
tools.
In
[7],
Illusie
has
proven
similar
results
using
essentially
equivalent
techniques
to
our
own,
although
from
a
somewhat
diﬀerent
point
of
view.
Namely,
Illusie
works
modulo
p,
and
obtains
the
following
result:
Theorem
:
(given
as
Remark
4.18
in
[7])
If
f
:
(X,
E)
→
(S,
D)
is
as
in
Theorem
3.4,
and
L
is
an
ample
line
bundle
on
S,
then
for
all
i
≥
1,
j
≥
0,
we
have:
H
i
(S,
L
⊗
Rj
f∗
(ωX/L
))
=
0.
(In
fact,
as
was
pointed
out
to
the
author
by
the
referee,
such
vanishing
results
can
also
be
proven
by
the
same
technique
as
that
used
in
[2]
to
prove
the
Kodaira
Vanishing
Theorem.)
When
the
base
S
is
projective,
then
Kollar
(in
[10])
shows
how
to
pass
from
a
vanishing
result
such
as
the
result
of
Illusie
just
quoted
to
a
semi-positivity
result
such
as
the
one
given
in
Theorem
3.4.
On
the
other
hand,
if
a
vector
bundle
E
on
S
is
found
to
be
semipositive,
and
L
is
an
ample
line
bundle
on
S,
then
F
=
E
⊗OS
L
forms
an
ample
vector
bundle
on
S.
It
is
not
diﬃcult
to
see
that
if
one
applies
Kodaira
vanishing
to
the
bundle
O(1)
on
the
projective
bundle
P
→
S
associated
to
F,
one
then
gets
a
vanishing
result
similar
to
the
above
quoted
result
of
Illusie,
but
somewhat
weaker.
Moreover,
when
S
is
a
curve,
it
follows
immediately
from
Serre
duality
that
Theorem
3.4
(for
the
case
of
trivial
coeﬃcients)
is
equivalent
to
the
vanishing
result
of
Illusie.
However,
in
the
case
of
higher
dimensional
S,
especially,
when
S
is
not
projective,
it
is
not
clear
to
the
author
what
the
precise
relationship
is
between
Illusie’s
result
quoted
above
and
Theorem
3.4.
The
author
would
like
to
express
his
gratitude
to
Prof.
B.
Mazur
for
reading

a
preliminary
draft
of
this
paper
and

Illusie;

for

of
the
original
argument.

§1.
Basic
Algebraic
Lemmas
Let
A
be
a
regular
noetherian
ring.
Let
X,
S
be
smooth,
proper
schemes
over
A,
and
let
D
⊆
S,
E
⊆
X
be
relative
divisors
with
normal
crossings
over
A.
Let
f
:
X
→
S
be
a
morphism
which
is
smooth
over
S
−
D,
and
such
that
(schematically)
E
=
f
−1
(D).
Note
that
these
assumptions
together
imply
that
f
is,
in
fact,
smooth
in
codimension
one.
To
simplify
things,
we
also
assume
that
f
has
geometrically
connected
ﬁbres
and
constant
relative
dimension.
Then,
using
the
terminology
of
log
schemes
as
given
in
[8],
we
make
the
following
Deﬁnition
1.1:
We
say
that
(f
:
X
→
S;
E;
D)
(or
just
f
:
X
→
S,
for
short)
is
a
semistable
family
of
varieties
(or
just
semistable
for
short)
if,
when
we
give
X
(respectively,
S)
the
log
structure
arising
from
the
divisor
with
normal
crossings
E
(respectively,
D),
the
morphism
of
log
schemes
induced
by
f
is
log-smooth.
If
f
:
X
→
S
is
semistable,
then
we
denote
the
relative
sheaf
of
logarithmic
diﬀerentials
by
th
exterior
power
of
Ωlog
Ωlog
X/S
.
If
the
relative
dimension
of
f
is
d,
then
we
denote
the
d
X/S
by
ωX/S
.
Note
that
ωX/S
is
the
relative
canonical
sheaf
of
X
over
S
in
the
sense
of
duality
theory.
Proposition
1.2:
Suppose
that
A
is
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld,
that
S
is
onedimensional
(i.e.,
a
curve),
and
that
L
is
an
ample
line
bundle
on
S.
Then
for
any
N
∈
N,
there
exists
a
ﬁnite,
ﬂat
morphism
π
:
T
→
S
which
has
the
following
properties:
(1)
T
is
a
smooth,
proper,
connected
A-scheme;
(2)
the
ramiﬁcation
divisor
R
⊆
S
of
π
avoids
D
(3)
dimA
H
0
(T,
LT
)
≥
N
.
Proof:
This
is
the
standard
technique
of
passing
to
a
ramiﬁed
cyclic
covering,
used,
for
instance,
in
algebraic
proofs
of
the
Kodaira
Vanishing
Theorem
(see
[2]).
Namely,
one
takes
a
very
high
tensor
power
of
L,
say
M
=
L⊗M
(where
we
take
M
to
be
very
large,
and
invertible
in
A),
such
that
M
is
very
ample.
Then
there
exists
a
section
σ
of
M
over
S
whose
zero
divisor
is
étale
over
A
and
avoids
D.
Then
taking
the
cyclic
covering
of
S

given
by
extracting
an
M
th
root
of
σ
gives
us
a
scheme
T
as
above
such
that
the
dimension
of
the
space
of
sections
over
T
of
L
is
one
greater
than
it
was
before.
Repeating
this
process
gives
the
inequality
desired.

Let
us
go
back
to
assuming
that
A
is
arbitrary
regular
noetherian
ring.
We
now
review
some
basic
well-known
facts
about
blow-ups.
Suppose
that
we
are
given
a
A-ﬂat
subscheme
3
F
⊆
S.
Let
us
say
that
F
is
ﬂatly
positioned
(respectively,
transversely
positioned)
with
respect
to
the
divisor
with
normal
crossings
D
if
for
any
étale
morphism
U
→
S
such
that
D|U
splits
into
a
union
of
smooth
components,
the
schematic
intersection
of
F
|U
with
any
irreducible
component
of
D|U
is
ﬂat
over
A
(respectively,
and
the
restriction
to
any
connected
component
I
⊆
F
|U
of
F
|U
of
the
union
of
irreducible
components
of
D|U
that
do
not
contain
I
is
a
relative
divisor
with
normal
crossings
on
I).
Lemma
1.3
:
Let
us
suppose
that
A
is
a
domain,
and
that
we
are
given
a
section
σ
:
Spec(A)
→
S
whose
image
is
ﬂatly
positioned
with
respect
to
D.
Let
π
:
S̃
→
S
be
the
blow-up
of
S
at
the
image
of
σ.
Then
S̃
is
smooth
over
A,
and
D̃
=
π
−1
(D)red
⊆
S̃
is
a
relative
divisor
with
normal
crossings
over
A.
Proof:
Indeed,
it
suﬃces
to
take
local
coordinates
x0
,
x1
,
.
.
.
,
xn
for
S
over
A
at
some
point
in
the
image
of
σ
such
that
the
image
of
σ
is
deﬁned
by
the
ideal
generated
by
the
x’s,
and
D
is
deﬁned
by
some
product
of
the
x’s.
The
result
follows
by
direct
computation.

Lemma
1.4
:
Suppose
that
A
is
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld,
and
that
we
are
given
an
A-smooth
curve
(i.e.,
an
A-smooth,
closed
subscheme
of
dimension
one)
C
⊆
S.
Then,
after
applying
a
series
of
blow-ups
of
S
at
closed
points,
we
can
obtain
a
birational
morphism
π
:
S̃
→
S
such
that
if
C̃
is
the
strict
transform
of
C
in
S̃,
and
D̃
=
π
−1
(D)red
,
then
C̃
is
transversely
positioned
with
respect
to
D̃.
Proof:
Clearly
we
can

assume
(by
using
étale
localization)
that
D
splits
into
a
union
of
smooth
divisors:
D
=
Di
.
Now
we
claim
that
after
a
series
of
blow-ups,
we
may
assume
that
each
Di
either
contains
C
or
intersects
C
transversely.
Indeed,
if
Di
intersects
C
at
a
point
with
multiplicity
r,
then
a
simple
calculation
reveals
that
after
blowing
up
at
that
point,
the
strict
transform
of
Di
intersects
the
strict
transform
of
C
with
multiplicity
≤
r−1,
while
the
exceptional
divisor
intersects
C
transversely.
Thus,
repeating
this
process
proves
the
claim.
Thus,
we
assume
that
each
Di
either
contains
C
or
intersects
C
transversely.
For
simplicity,
by
localizing,
we
can
also
assume
that
C
fails
to
be
transversely
positioned
with
respect
to
D
at
only
one
point.
With
these
assumptions,
the
only
thing
that
could
keep
C
from
being
transversely
positioned
is
if
two
or
more
distinct
Di
’s
intersect
C
transversely
at
the
same
point.
If
this
happens,
then
let
us
blow
up
the
point.
It
is
then
easy
to
see
that
the
strict
transforms
of
those
Di
’s
do
not
meet
the
strict
transform
of
C.
This
completes
the
proof.

Now
let
us
go
back
to
assuming
that
A
is
a
regular
noetherian
ring.
Let
us
suppose
that
C
is
a
smooth,
geometrically
connected
curve
over
A
which
is
embedded
as
a
transversely
positioned
closed
subscheme
C
⊆
S
with
respect
to
the
divisor
D.
Let
us
denote
by
S
log
the
log
scheme
(see
[8]
for
details)
obtained
by
putting
on
S
the
log
structure
associated
4
to
the
divisor
with
normal
crossings
D.
Let
C
vir
be
the
log
scheme
obtained
by
placing
on
C
the
log
structure
obtained
by
pulling
back
the
log
structure
of
S
log
to
C.
(Here
“vir”
stands
for
virtual,
since
the
log
structure
involves
“virtual
divisors”
that
don’t
really
exist
on
C.)
Finally,
let
C
phs
be
the
log
scheme
obtained
by
putting
on
C
the
log
structure
obtained
étale
locally
on
C
by
restricting
to
C
only
the
components
of
D
that
do
not
contain
C.
(Here
“phs”
stands
for
“physical”
since
the
log
structure
arises
from
actual
“physical”
divisors
on
C.)
Thus,
we
have
natural
morphisms
of
log
schemes
C
vir
→
S
log
,
and
ν
:
C
vir
→
C
phs
.
Note
that
ν
induces,
via
pull-back,
a
locally
split
morphism
of
vector
bundles
ν
∗
:
ΩC
phs
/A
→
ΩC
vir
/A
on
C;
let
us
denote
the
cokernel
vector
bundle
by
ResC
vir
/A
.
Thus,
intuitively
speaking,
ResC
vir
/A
corresponds
to
the
residues
with
respect
to
the
components
of
D
that
contain
C.
It
is
easy
to
see
that
ResC
vir
/A
becomes
trivial
after
pull-back
to
some
ﬁnite
étale
morphism
G
→
C.
Indeed,
one
need
merely
take
a
covering
G
→
C
on
which
the
étale
local
system
of
“smooth
irreducible
components
of
D
that
contain
C”
splits.
On
such
a
G,
one
then
obtains
a
global
(i.e.,
over
all
of
G)
basis
for
ResC
vir
/A
by
considering
the
logarithmic
diﬀerentials
of
functions
deﬁning
the
various
smooth
irreducible
components.
Thus,
in
the
future,
often
it
will
be
convenient
to
assume,
in
this
situation,
that
ResC
vir
/A
already
is
trivial,
and
it
is
always
possible
to
assume
this
by
replacing
C
by
the
ﬁnite
étale
cover
G.

We
now
wish
to
discuss
This
completes
our
review
of
the
deﬁnition
of
MF[a,b]
∇
.
Let
us
assume
that
we
are
given
certain
functoriality
properties
of
the
category
MF[a,b]
an
A-smooth
closed,
one-dimensional
subscheme
C
⊆
S
which
is
transversely
positioned
(see
§1
for
a
deﬁnition)
with
respect
to
D.
Let
F
⊆
C
be
the
divisor
(necessarily
étale
over
A)
obtained
by
restricting
to
C
the
irreducible
components
of
D
that
do
not
contain
C.
(In
fact,
these
irreducible
components
may
only
exist
after
étale
localization,
so
one
may
need
to
apply
étale
descent
to
construct
F
,
but
this
is
no
problem.)
With
the
choice
∇
of
divisor
F
⊆
C,
we
may
consider
the
category
MF[a,b]
(C
◦
).
We
wish
to
construct
a
restriction
functor
∇
∇
(S
◦
)
→
MF[a,b]
(C
◦
)
ρ
:
MF[a,b]
as
follows.
Clearly,
we
can
use
étale
descent,
and
thus
assume
that
S
=
Spec(R),
C
=
Spec(T
)
and
that
D
splits
as
a
union
of
smooth
divisors.
Also,
we
use
the
notation
of
“vir”
and
“phs”
to
denote
the
various
log
structures
on
C
deﬁned
at
the
end
of
§1.
We
start
with
R-modules
M
,
F
i
(M
),
together
with
various
split
injections
among
these
modules
and
an
integrable
logarithmic
connection
∇
:
M
→
M
⊗R
Ωlog
R/A
.
These
restrict
to
modules
i
MC
,
F
(M
)C
,
along
with
various
split
injections
and
an
integrable
logarithmic
connection
log
∇vir
C
:
MC
→
MC
⊗T
ΩC
vir
/A
.
Of
course,
ideally,
we
would
like
an
object
with
connection
on
the
log
scheme
C
phs
,
not
C
vir
.
To
obtain
such
an
object
we
reason
as
follows.
First,
by
(ﬁnite)
étale
descent,
we
assume
that
ResC
vir
/A
is
a
trivial
vector
bundle,
and
we
choose
a
basis
of
generating
sections
of
ResC
vir
/A
over
C
each
of
which
is
locally
obtained
as
the
logarithmic
diﬀerential
of
a
function
deﬁning
a
smooth
irreducible
component
of
D,
and
we
let
s1
,
.
.
.
,
sr
be
the
corresponding
basis
of
the
dual
vector
bundle
Res∨
C
vir
/A
.
By
applying
vir
∇C
to
each
of
the
si
,
we
obtain
a
collection
of
commuting
(because
of
the
integrability
of
∇)
OC
-linear
endomorphisms
Ni
:
MC
→
MC
,
for
i
=
1,
.
.
.
,
r.
Moreover,
since
they
∇
represent
the
monodromy
of
an
object
of
MF[a,b]
,
the
Ni
are
necessarily
nilpotent.
Indeed,
to
see
this,
we
reason
as
follows:
Let
N
be
one
of
the
Ni
’s.
Note
that
there
exists
(by
condition
(3)
above)
a
“Verschiebung”
morphism
V
:
M
→
M
⊗R̂,Φ
R̂
such
that
φa
◦V
=
pj
def
and
V
◦
φa
=
pj
,
where
j
=
b
−
a.
Thus,
(by
condition
(5)
above)
N
j
=
φa
◦
N
j
◦
V
,
so
N
2j
=
pj
·
φa
◦
N
2j
◦
V
.
Thus,
by
recursion,
N
2j
=
0.
This
proves
that
the
Ni
are
nilpotent.
Thus,
the
Ni
deﬁne
a
ﬁltration
with
r
indices,
which
we
call
the
monodromy
ﬁltration
on
MC
,
and
which
we
denote
by:
μi1
,...,iα
,...,ir
(MC
)
=
Ker(N1i1
.
.
.
Nαiα
.
.
.
Nrir
)
Now
let
Grμ
(MC
)
denote
the
graded
object
associated
to
the
monodromy
ﬁltration.
It
is
clear
that
the
ﬁltration
F
i
(M
)C
deﬁnes
a
natural
ﬁltration
F
i
(Grμ
(MC
))
on
Grμ
(MC
),
7
gr
and
that
∇vir
:
Grμ
(MC
)
→
Grμ
(MC
)
⊗T
Ωlog
,
as
desired.
C
induces
a
connection
∇
C
phs
/A
i
gr
It
is
easy
to
see
that
(Grμ
(MC
),
F
(Grμ
(MC
)),
∇
)
satisfy
all
the
necessary
axioms
for
∇
an
object
of
MF[a,b]
(C
◦
),
and
all
that
remains
to
do
in
deﬁning
ρ
is
the
construction
of
the
Frobenius
action
on
Grμ
(MC
).
First
of
all,
because
of
our
assumption
that
C
is
transversely
positioned,
one
sees
easily
that
(after
possible
further
étale
localization)
it
is
possible
to
choose
a
Frobenius
lifting
Φ
:
R̂
→
R̂
that
not
only
ﬁxes
D,
but
also
ﬁxes
C
(and
F
).
Thus,
Φ
restricts
to
a
Frobenius
lifting
ΦC
:
T̂
→
T̂
,
so
that
tensoring
φ
over
R
with
T
(via
the
natural
projection
R
→
T
)
gives
an
isomorphism
φC
:
M˜C
⊗T,ΦC
T
∼
=
(M̃
⊗R,Φ
R)
⊗R
T
→
MC
.
Since
this
Frobenius
action
on
MC
clearly
commutes
with
the
Ni
,
it
follows
that
the
Frobenius
action
on
MC
induces
a
Frobenius
action
on
Grμ
(MC
).
One
checks
easily
that
the
Frobenius
that
we
obtain
on
Grμ
(MC
)
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
Φ
(as
long
as
we
deal
with
Φ
that
ﬁx
C
and
D):
indeed,
the
morphism
α
constructed
in
the
proof
of
[1],
Theorem
2.3,
is
easily
seen
to
commute
with
restriction
to
C.
Finally,
it
is
easy
to
check
that
this
Frobenius
action
satisﬁes
all
the
remaining
properties
in
the
deﬁnition
of
the
category
MF
∇
:
Indeed,
this
follows
from
using
the
fact
that
MF
(i.e.,
the
category
of
[1],
§2,
that
is
similar
to
MF
∇
,
but
lacks
the
datum
of
a
connection)
is
abelian
([1],
Theorem
2.1,
Corollary).
This
completes
the
deﬁnition
of
the
functor
ρ.
Now
we
wish
to
note
that
functoriality
also
holds
for
blow-ups
π
:
S̃
→
S
at
a
section
σ
:
Spec(A)
→
S
which
is
ﬂatly
positioned.
The
procedure
is
the
same
as
in
the
previous
paragraph:
one
pulls
back
the
necessary
modules,
morphisms,
and
connection
in
the
obvious
fashion;
the
only
trick
is
pulling
back
the
Frobenius
action.
The
key
is
to
note
that
since
σ
is
ﬂatly
positioned,
one
can
choose
the
Frobenius
lifting
Φ
:
R̂
→
R̂
in
such
a
way
that
not
only
D,
but
also
σ
is
ﬁxed
by
Φ.
It
is
then
easy
to
see
that
the
Frobenius
action
on
R̂
extends
to
a
Frobenius
action
on
the
p-adic
completion
of
S̃
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
functorial
with
respect
to
π.
It
remains
to
check
that
π
∗
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
Frobenius
lifting
Φ.
But
the
only
thing
which
is
unclear
is
whether
or
not
the
Frobenius
action
depends
on
Φ,
and
this
follows
from
restricting
to
a
dense
open
subset
of
S
over
which
π
is
an
isomorphism.
Thus,
we
see
that
we
get
a
natural
functor
∇
∇
(S
◦
)
→
MF[a,b]
((S̃)◦
)
π
∗
:
MF[a,b]
as
desired.
Now
let
C
→
Spec(A)
be
a
proper,
smooth
curve,
with
geometrically
connected
ﬁbres,
and
let
F
⊆
C
be
an
étale
divisor
over
A.
Let
us
suppose
that
we
are
given
a
ﬁnite
morphism
ψ
:
C
→
S.
Then
we
shall
say
that
ψ
is
admissibly
factorizable
if
it
factors
into
the
composite
of
the
following
form:
(1)
we
have
a
morphism
ψ1
:
S̃
→
S,
which
is
the
composite
of
a
sequence
of
blow-ups
at
A-sections
that
are
ﬂatly
positioned
over
A;
let
D̃
=
ψ1−1
(D)red
;
8
(2)
for
some
C

→
Spec(A)
(also
a
smooth
curve
with
geometrically
connected
ﬁbres)
and
some
F

⊆
C

(an
étale
divisor
over
A),
we
have
a
closed
immersion
ψ2
:
C

→
S̃
such
that
C

is
transversely
positioned
with
respect
to
D̃,
and
F

is
the
restriction
to
C

of
the
components
of
D̃
that
do
not
contain
C

;
we
also
assume
that
C

is
not
contained
in
any
of
the
exceptional
divisors
of
the
morphism
ψ1
;
(3)
we
have
a
morphism
ψ3
:
C
→
C

such
that
ψ3−1
(F

)red
⊆
F
and
ψ3
is
étale
outside
of
F
with
tame
ramiﬁcation
at
F
;
so
that
ψ
=
ψ1
◦
ψ2
◦
ψ3
.
Let
us
suppose
that
ψ
is
admissibly
factorizable.
Then
by
the
functoriality
considerations
reviewed
above,
it
is
clear
that
by
composition
we
obtain
a
functor
∇
∇
(S
◦
)
→
MF[a,b]
(C
◦
)
ψ
∗
:
MF[a,b]
(Indeed,
only
for
morphisms
like
ψ3
did
we
not
discuss
functoriality;
but
functoriality
for
morphisms
of
this
type
is
the
most
obvious.)
It
remains
to
see
that
ψ
∗
is
independent
of
the
factorization
ψ
=
ψ1
◦
ψ2
◦
ψ3
.
This
is
clear
for
all
the
data
involved
except
(perhaps)
for
the
Frobenius
action
and
the
formation
of
Grμ
(−);
but
this
follows,
as
usual,
by
restricting
to
the
open
dense
subset
C
−F
,
where
the
fact
that
the
Frobenius
action
and
the
formation
of
Grμ
(−)
are
independent
of
the
factorization
is
clear.
We
thus
summarize
our
ﬁndings
in
the
following
Proposition
2.2:
For
all
admissibly
factorizable
morphisms
ψ

(C,

The
Main
Theorem
Before
stating
and
proving
the
Main
Theorem
of
this
paper,
we
need
to
introduce
some
new
deﬁnitions.
Unfortunately,
these
deﬁnitions
are
somewhat
ad

but
at

they
allow
us
to

a

with
a
somewhat

of

than
previous
statements
of
such

(as
given
in

Let

Let

E

Fix
a

Let
us
suppose
that
we
are
given
a

with

that

Then
we
make

Let
us
ﬁx
such
models
XR
,
ER
,
AR
,
and
(∇A
)R
over
R,
and
denote
by
means
of
a
subscript
the
result
of
base-changing
these
objects
from
R
to
some
R-algebra.
Then
we
shall
say
that
(A,
∇A
,
F
i
(A))
is
globally
crystalline
if
for
almost
all
primes
℘
of
L,
when
we
base-change
from
R
to
the
completion
A℘
of
OL
(the
ring
of
integers)
at
℘,
the
resulting
ﬁltered
vector
bundle
with
connection
arises
from
an
inverse
system
of
objects
∇
◦
{A℘,n
}n∈N
(where
A℘,n
is
ﬂat
over
Z/pn
Z)
of
MF[0,a]
(XA
).
℘
(ii)
If
L
is
any
ﬁeld
(of
characteristic
zero),
then
we
say
that
(A,
∇A
,
F
i
(A))
is
globally
crystalline
if
there
is
a
ﬁnitely
generated
Q-subalgebra
R
⊆
L
over
which
X,
E,
A,
∇A
,
and
the
F
i
(A)
are
deﬁned
and
satisfy
the
same
hypotheses
as
they
did
over
L
(i.e.
being
proper
and
smooth,
being
a
relative
divisor
with
normal
crossings,
being
a
vector
bundle,
being
a
locally
split
inclusion,
being
a
connection
with
logarithmic
poles
at
E,
etc.)
such
that
at
all
closed
points
of
Spec(R)
(whose
residue
ﬁelds
are
necessarily
number
ﬁelds),
the
restricted
ﬁltered
vector
bundle
is
globally
crystalline
(as
in
(i)).
Note
that
if
(A,
∇A
,
F
i
(A))
is
globally
crystalline,
then
the
OX
-dual
of
A,
which
we
denote
by
A∨
,
endowed
with
the
dual
ﬁltration
(shifted
over
a
places)
and
connection,
gives
rise
to
a
ﬁltered
vector
bundle
with
connection
(A∨
,
∇A∨
,
F
i
(A∨
))
which
is
again
globally
crystalline.
Continuing
with
our
ﬁeld
L
of
characteristic
zero,
suppose
that
X
is
proper
and
geometrically
connected,
and
that
we
are
also
given
a
smooth,
proper,
geometrically
connected
L-scheme
S
and
a
divisor
with
normal
crossings
D
⊆
S,
plus
a
morphism
f
:
(X,
E)
→
(S,
D)
which
is
semistable
in
the
sense
of
Deﬁnition
1.1.
Lemma
3.2
:
We
denote
by
d
the
relative
dimension
of
X
over
S.
Suppose
that
i
(A,
∇A

F

is
globally
crystalline.
Then
for
any

≥
0,
the
de

◦
Rd−i
(fDR

(A,
∇A
),
together
with
the
Gauss-Manin
connection,
and
the
Hodge
ﬁltration
(induced
by
F

constitute
a
globally
crystalline
object
on
(S,

Let
(B,
∇B
,
F

be
the

to
this

Then,
(B/F

Ri
f∗

Proof:
This
follows
from
[1],
Theorem

and
Grothendieck-Serre
duality
applied
to
the

f
(for

Lemma
3.3
:
Assume
that
L
is
algebraically
closed.
Suppose
that
we
have
a
vector
bundle
with
connection
(A,
∇A
)
on
a
X
with
logarithmic
poles
at
E.
Then
0
(X,
A)
≤
rank(A),
where
by
the
subscript
“DR,”
we
mean
the
horizontal
dimL
HDR
global
sections.
Proof:
By
formal
integration
using
the
connection,
and
the
fact
that
in
characteristic
zero,
the
exterior
derivative
vanishes
only
on
constant
functions,
it
follows
that
a
horizontal
global
section
is
determined
by
its
value
at
a
single
point.

We
now
review
some
basic
deﬁnitions
about
semi-positivity
from
[5].
Let
V
be
a
projective
variety
over
a
ﬁeld
L.
Then
a
line
bundle
L
on
V
is
semi-positive
if
for
any
ﬁnite
morphism
g
:
C
→
V
,
where
C
is
a
smooth,
projective
curve,
the
degree
of
g
∗
L
is
nonnegative.
If
E
is
a
vector
bundle
on
V
,
then
E
is
semi-positive
if
the
O(1)-bundle
on
PV
(E)
is
semi-positive.
It
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
if
E
is
semi-positive
and
L
is
an
ample
line
bundle,
then
E
⊗OV
L
is
an
ample
vector
bundle
on
V
.
We
are
now
ready
to
state
the
Main
Theorem
of
this
paper.
Various
forms
of
this
theorem
were
proven
previously
by
Fujita
([5])
and
Kawamata
([9]).
Moreover,
as
Viehweg
remarks
in
[11],
§1.21,
the
techniques
of
J.
Kollar,
when
taken
with
the
results
of
Deligne
on
the
degeneration
of
the
Hodge-Deligne
spectral
sequence,
constitute
an
algebraic
proof
of
this
sort
of
result.
Strictly
speaking,
the
result
given
here
does
not
quite
imply
Kawamata’s
result
because
our
deﬁnition
of
semistability
(involving
a
geometric
condition
on
the
divisors
at
inﬁnity,
as
opposed
to
a
monodromy-type
condition)
is
stronger
than
Kawamata’s.
(Kollar
uses
a
similar
deﬁnition
to
our
own.)
Finally,
as
mentioned
in
the
Introduction,
there
is
the
paper
[7].
The
proof
given
here
is
a
simpliﬁcation
of
the
author’s
original
proof,
following
a
suggestion
of
Prof
A.
Ogus.
Theorem
3.4:
Let
f
:
(X,
E)
→
(S,
D)
be
a
semistable
family
of
varieties
of
relative
dimension
d,
with
S
a
smooth,
proper
scheme
over
a
ﬁeld
L
of
characteristic
zero.
Let
(A,
∇A
,
F
i
(A))
be
a
globally
crystalline
ﬁltered
vector
bundle
with
connection
on
(X,
E).
Then
for
any
nonnegative
integer
α,
the
coherent
sheaf
of
OS
-modules
Rα
f∗
(ωX/S
⊗OX
(A/F
1
(A))∨
)
is
a
semi-positive
vector
bundle,
as
are
all
of
its
tensor
powers.
Proof:
First
of
all,
by
Lemma
3.2,
since
taking
de
Rham
cohomology
and
tensor
products
does
not
take
us
out
of
the
category
MF
∇
,
we
may
assume
that
f
is
the
identity,
and
we
may
prove
the
result
for
the
“ﬁrst
tensor
power,”
i.e.,
the
original
globally
crystalline
object.
Also,
without
loss
of
generality,
let
us
assume
that
L
is
algebraically
closed.
Let
S
be
the
vector
bundle
(A/F
1
(A))∨
.
Let
r
=
rank(A).
Let
us
assume
that
S
is
not
semi-positive.
Then
there
exists
some
smooth,
proper,
connected
curve
C
over
L,
together
with
a
ﬁnite
morphism
ψ
:
C
→
S
and
a
nonzero
11
morphism
SC
→
Q,
where
Q
is
a
line
bundle
of
negative
degree.
By
Proposition
1.2,
after
replacing
C
by
a
ﬁnite
covering
of
C,
we
may
assume
that
h0
(C,
Q−1
)
≥
1
+
r.
Thus,
by
dualizing
the
morphism
SC
→
Q,
we
see
that
h0
(C,
SC∨
)
≥
1
+
r.
On
the
other
hand,
by
Lemma
1.4,
there
exists
a
birational
map
π
:
S̃
→
S
obtained
as
a
sequence
of
blow-ups
at
closed
points
such
that
the
morphism
C
→
S̃
(obtained
from
ψ
by
the
valuative
criterion
of
properness)
factors
through
a
smooth,
proper,
connected
curve
C

embedded
in
S̃:
that
is,
we
have
a
ﬁnite
morphism
ψ1
:
C
→
C

and
an
embedding
ψ2
:
C

→
S̃
whose
composite
is
the
morphism
C
→
S̃.
Moreover,
by
Lemma
1.4,
we
can
assume
that
the
image
of
C

is
transversely
positioned
with
respect
to
D̃
=
π
−1
(D)red
.
It
thus
follows
that
by
spreading
out,
specializing,
completing,
we
obtain
objects
CA
,
SA
,
DA
,
etc.
over
a
ring
A
satisfying
the
hypotheses
given
at
the
beginning
of
§2,
together
with
a
divisor
FA
⊆
CA
such
that
ψA
:
(CA
,
FA
)
→
(SA
,
DA
)
is
admissibly
factorizable
(in
the
sense
of
the
deﬁnition
given
directly
before
Proposition
2.2).
Thus,
for
the
rest
of
the
proof,
we
shall
work
over
A,
and
omit
the
subscripts
for
all
the
objects
that
have
been
base
changed
into
objects
over
A.
Thus,
in
summary,
we
have
an
admissibly
factorizable
morphism
ψ
:
(C,
F
)
→
(S,
D),
such
that
h0
(CK
,
SC∨K
)
≥
1
+
r,
where
K,
as
usual,
is
the
quotient
ﬁeld
of
A.
Now
recall
that
S
∨
=
A/F
1
(A).
Let
us
consider
the
inverse
system
(M,
∇M
,
F
i
(M
),
φi
)
of
∇
objects
of
MF[0,a]
(S
◦
)
associated
to
(A,
∇A
,
F
j
(A))
whose
existence
is
guaranteed
by
the
fact
that
(A,
∇A
,
F
j
(A))
is
globally
crystalline.
(We
shall
regard
this
inverse
system
as
a
single
object,
which
is
ﬂat
over
Zp
.)
Let
us
apply
the
pull-back
functor
of
Proposition
2.2
to
(M,
∇M
,
F
i
(M
),
φi
)
to
obtain
a
Zp
-ﬂat
object
(actually,
an
inverse
system)
∇
(N,
∇N
,
F
i
(N
),
ψ
i
)
of
MF[0,a]
(C
◦
).
Now
since
h0
(CK
,
SC∨K
)
≥
1
+
r,
and
N/F
1
(N
)
is
a
direct
sum
of
subquotients
of
the
monodromy
ﬁltration
on
SC∨
=
ψ
∗
(M/F
1
(M
)),
we
thus
obtain
that
h0
(CK
,
(N/F
1
(N
))K
)
≥
1
+
r
0
By
Lemma
2.1,
this
implies
that
dimK
HDR
(CK
,
NK
)
≥
1
+
r.
Since
r
is
the
rank
of
the
vector
bundle
M
,
and
hence
also
of
the
vector
bundle
N
,
we
thus
conclude
from
Lemma
3.3
that
we
have
a
contradiction.
This
completes
the
proof.

In
particular,
let
us
consider
(under
the
hypotheses
of
Theorem
3.4)
the
globally
◦
crystalline
triple
(B,
F
i
(B),
∇B
)
(on
(S,
D))
given
by
R2d−i
(fDR
)∗
(OX
),
together
with
its
Hodge
ﬁltration
and
the
Gauss-Manin
connection.
Let
(A,
F
i
(A),
∇A
)
be
the
triple
obtained
from
(B,
F
i
(B),
∇B
)
by
shifting
the
ﬁltration
down
by
d
−
i
places.
Just
as
in
Lemma
3.2,
we
see
that
d−i
∨
i
(A/F
1
(A))∨
=
(Rd
f∗
(Ωlog
)
=
f∗
((Ωlog
X/S
)
X/S
)
)
Thus,
if
we
apply
Theorem
3.4
to
(A,
F
i
(A),
∇A
)
and
the
identity
morphism
on
S,
we
see
obtain
the
following:
12
Corollary
3.5:
Let
f
:
(X,
E)
→
(S,
D)
be
as
above.
Then
for
any
nonnegative
integer
α,
the
coherent
sheaf
of
OS
-modules
α
f∗
((Ωlog
X/S
)
)
is
a
semi-positive
vector
bundle,
as
are
all
of
its
tensor
powers.
Appendix:
The
Case
of
One-Dimensional
Fibres
Let
f
:
X
→
S,
D,
and
E
be
as
in
§1,
with
f
semistable
and
of
relative
dimension
one,
and
suppose
that
S
is
a
curve.
Let
us
assume
that
the
ring
A
in
§1
is
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
k
of
characteristic
zero.
Then
we
have
the
following
Theorem
:
The
vector
bundle
f∗
ωX/S
on
S
is
semi-positive
in
the
sense
that
there
do
not
exist
nonzero
morphisms
φ
:
f∗
ωX/S
→
Q,
where
Q
is
a
line
bundle
on
S
of
negative
degree.
Proof:
Let
us
assume
that
such
a
φ
exists.
By
Proposition
1.2,
we
may
assume
that
dimk
H
0
(S,
Q−1
)
≥
g
+
1,
where
g
is
the
genus
of
the
generic
ﬁbre
of
f
.
Thus,
by
considering
φ∨
:
Q−1
→
R1
f∗
OX
,
we
see
that
dimk
H
0
(S,
R1
f∗
OX
)
≥
g
+
1.
By
the
LeraySerre
spectral
sequence
for
f
applied
to
the
sheaf
OX
,
we
see
that
we
have,
in
fact,
dimk
H
1
(X,
OX
)
≥
q
+
g
+
1,
where
q
is
the
genus
of
S.
On
the
other
hand,
since
we
are
in
characteristic
zero,
dimk
H
1
(X,
OX
)
is
exactly
the
dimension
of
P
ic0
(X)
over
k.
Thus,
we
see
that
dimk
(P
ic0
(X))
≥
q
+
g
+
1.
Now
we
recompute
the
dimension
of
P
ic0
(X)
by
means
of
l-adic
cohomology
to
see
that
this
is
absurd.
Indeed,
by
applying
the
Leray-Serre
spectral
sequence
for
fet
to
the
étale
sheaf
Ql
(1),
we
see
that
dimQl
H
1
(Xet
,
Ql
(1))
≤
2q
+
2g.
On
the
other
hand,
Kummer
theory
tells
us
that
dimQl
H
1
(Xet
,
Ql
(1))
is
equal
to
twice
the
dimension
(over
k)
of
P
ic0
(X)
(since
P
ic0
(X)
is
an
abelian
variety
over
k).
Putting
this
together
with
the
inequality
derived
in
the
ﬁrst
paragraph,
we
obtain
a
contradiction.
