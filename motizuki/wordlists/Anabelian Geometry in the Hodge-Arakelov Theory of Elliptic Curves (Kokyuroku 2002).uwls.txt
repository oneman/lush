Abstract:
The
purpose
of
the
present
manuscript
is
to
survey
some
of
the
main
ideas
that
appear
in
recent
research
of
the
author
on
the
topic
of
applying
anabelian
geometry
to
construct
a
“global
multiplicative
subspace”
—
i.e.,
an
analogue
of
the
well-known
(local)
multiplicative
subspace
of
the
Tate
module
of
a
degenerating
elliptic
curve.
Such
a
global
multiplicative
subspace
is
necessary
to
apply
the
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
of
elliptic
curves
([Mzk1-5];
also
cf.
[Mzk6],
[Mzk7]
for
a
survey
of
this
theory)
—
i.e.,
a
sort
of
“Hodge
theory
of
elliptic
curves”
analogous
to
the
classical
complex
and
p-adic
Hodge
theories,
but
which
exists
in
the
global
arithmetic
framework
of
Arakelov
theory
—
to
obtain
results
in
diophantine
geometry.
Unfortunately,
since
this
research
is
still
in
progress,
the
author
is
not
able
at
the
present
time
to
give
a
complete,
polished
treatment
of
this
theory.

Multiplicative

and
Hodge-Arakelov
Theory
At
a
technical
level,
the
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
of
elliptic
curves
may
in
some
sense
be
summarized
as
the
arithmetic
theory
of
the
theta
function
Θ=

n∈Z
and
its
logarithmic
derivatives
(U

)r
Θ.
Here,
we
think
of
the
elliptic
curve
in
question
as
the
“complex
analytic
Tate
curve”

E
=
C×
/q
Z
def
where
q
∈
C×
satisﬁes
|q|
<
1.
Note
that
this
representation
of
E
as
a
quotient
of
C×
induces
a
natural
exact
sequence
on
the
singular
homology
of
E:
0
→
2πi
·
Z
=
H1sing
(C×
,
Z)
→
H1sing
(E,
Z)
→
Z
→
0
We
shall
refer
to
the
subspace
Im(2πi
·
Z)
⊆
H1sing
(E,
Z)
as
the
multiplicative
subspace
of
H1sing
(E,
Z),
and
to
the
generator
1
∈
Z
(well-deﬁned
up
to
multiplication
by
±1)
of
the
quotient
of
H1sing
(E,
Z)
by
the
multiplicative
subspace
as
the
canonical
generator
of
this
quotient.
It
is
not
diﬃcult
to
see
that
the
multiplicative
subspace
and
canonical
generator
constitute
the
essential
data
necessary
to
represent
the
theta
function
as
a
series
in
q
and
U
.
Without
this
representation,
it
is
extremely
diﬃcult
to
perform
explicit
calculations
concerning
Θ
and
its
derivatives.
Indeed,
it
is
(practically)
no
exaggeration
to
state
that
all
the
main
results
of
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
are,
at
some
level,
merely
formal
consequences
of
this
series
representation
—
i.e.,
of
the
existence
of
the
multiplicative
subspace/canonical
generator
(and
its
arithmetic
analogues).
Since,
ultimately,
however,
we
wish
to
“do
arithmetic,”
it
is
necessary
to
be
able
to
consider
the
analogue
of
the
above
discussion
in
various
arithmetic
situations.
The
most
basic
arithmetic
situation
in
which
such
an
analogue
exists
is
the
def
following.
Write
A
=
Z[[q]]
⊗Z
Q[q
−1
]
(where
q
is
an
indeterminate).
Write
E
=
‘Gm
/q
Z
’
def
for
the
Tate
curve
over
A.
Then
the
structure
of
E
as
a
(rigid
analytic)
quotient
of
Gm
gives
rise
to
an
exact
sequence
0
→
μd
→
E[d]
→
Z/dZ
→
0
involving
the
group
scheme
E[d]
(over
A)
of
d-torsion
points,
for
some
integer
d
≥
1.
This
exact
sequence
is
a
“q-analytic”
analogue
of
the
complex
analytic
exact
sequence
considered
above.
We
shall
refer
to
the
image
Im(μd
)
⊆
E[d]
(respectively,
generator
1
∈
Z/dZ,
well-deﬁned
up
to
multiplication
by
±1)
as
the
multiplicative
subspace
(respectively,
canonical
generator)
of
E[d].
Since
much
of
the
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
of
elliptic
curves
deals
with
the
values
of
Θ
and
its
derivatives
on
the
d-torsion
points,
it
is
not
surprising
that
this
multiplicative
subspace/canonical
generator
play
an
important
role
in
HodgeArakelov
theory,
especially
from
the
point
of
view
of
“eliminating
Gaussian
poles”
(cf.
[Mzk2];
[Mzk6],
§1.5.1).

Note
that
by
pulling
back
the
objects
constructed
above
over
A,
one
may
construct
a
multiplicative
subspace/canonical
generator
for
any
Tate
curve
over
a
p-adic
local
ﬁeld,
e.g.,
a
completion
Fp
of
a
number
ﬁeld
F
at
a
ﬁnite
prime
p.
Ultimately,
however,
to
apply
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
to
diophantine
geometry,
it
is
necessary
to
construct
a
multiplicative
subspace/canonical
generator
not
just
over
such
local
ﬁelds,
but
globally
over
a
number
ﬁeld.
It
turns
out
that
this
is
a
highly
nontrivial
enterprise,
which
requires,
in
an
essential
way,
the
use
of
anabelian
geometry,
as
will
be
described
below.
Section
2:
Basepoints
in
Motion
In
this
§,
we
let
F
be
a
number
ﬁeld
and
consider
an
elliptic
curve
E
over
G
=
Spec(F
)
with
bad,
multiplicative
reduction
at
a
ﬁnite
prime
pG
of
F
.
Write
def
N
→G
∼
for
the
ﬁnite
Galois
étale
covering
of
trivializations
(Z/dZ)2
→
E[d]
of
the
ﬁnite
étale
group
scheme
of
d-torsion
points
E[d];
denote
the
ﬁnite
étale
local
system
determined
by
E[d]
over
G
(respectively,
N
)
by
EG
(respectively,
EN
).
Also,
for
simplicity,
we
assume
that
N
is
connected
(an
assumption
which
holds,
for
instance,
whenever
d
is
a
power
of
a
suﬃciently
large
prime
number).
∼
Note
that
there
is
a
tautological
trivialization
(Z/dZ)2
→
E[d]
of
E[d]
over
N
.
By
applying
this
tautological
trivialization
to
the
elements
“(1,
0)”
and
“(0,
1),”
respectively,
we
obtain
—
just
as
a
matter
of
“general
nonsense,”
i.e.,
without
applying
any
diﬃcult
results
from
anabelian
geometry
—
a
submodule/generator
(of
the
quotient
by
the
submodule)
of
EN
.
Now,
let
us
choose
a
prime
of
N
p
lying
over
pG
with
the
property
that
this
submodule/generator
coincides
with
the
multiplicative
subspace/canonical
generator
(cf.
§1)
at
pG
.
(One
veriﬁes
easily
that
such
a
p
always
exists.)
Denote
this
data
of
submodule/generator
of
EN
by:
L,N
⊆
EN
;
γ,N
Note
that
although
the
restricted
data
L,N
|p
;
γ,N
|p
is
(by
construction)
multiplicative/canonical
at
p
,
at
“most”
of
the
primes
pN
of
N
lying
over
pG
,
the
restricted
data
will
not
be
multiplicative/canonical.
Thus:

At
ﬁrst
glance,
the
goal
of
constructing
a
submodule/generator
which
is
“always
multiplicative/canonical”
globally
over
all
of
N
appears
to
be
hopeless.
In
fact,
however,
in
the
theory
of
[Mzk16],
we
wish
to
think
about
things
in
a
diﬀerent
way
from
the
“naive”
approach
just
described.
Namely,
in
addition
to
the
original
(set-theoretic)
universe

in
which
we
have
been
working
up
until
now
—
which
we
shall
also
often
refer
to
as
the
“base
universe”
—
we
would
also
like
to
consider
another
distinct,
independent
universe
in
which
“equivalent/analogous,
but
not
equal”
objects
are
constructed.
This
analogous,
but
distinct
universe
will
be
referred
to
as
the
reference
universe:

The
analogous
objects
belonging
to
the
reference
universe
will
be
denoted
by
a
subscript
:
e.g.,
G
,
N
,
etc.
Then
instead
of
thinking
of
the
primes
pN
of
N
which
lie
over
pG
as
primes
at
which
one
is
to
restrict
L,N
;
γ,N
to
see
if
they
are
canonical
(i.e.,
multiplicative/canonical),
we
think
of
these
points
as
parametrizing
the
possible
relationships
between
the
N
of
the
“original
universe”
and
the
N
of
the
“reference
universe.”
That
is
to
say,
assuming
for
the
moment
that
there
is
a
canonical
identiﬁcation
between
G
and
G
—
a
fact
which
is
not
obvious
(or
indeed
true,
without
certain
further
assumptions
—
cf.
Example
3.2
in
§3
below),
but
is,
in
fact,
a
highly
nontrivial
consequence
of
the
methods
introduced
in
§3
—
then
pN
parametrizes
that
particular
relationship
“α[pN
;
p
]”
(well-deﬁned
up
to
an
ambiguity
described
by
the
action
of
the
decomposition
subgroup
in
Gal(N
/G)
determined
by
pN
)
between
N
,
N
that
associates
the
prime
pN
of
N
to
the
prime
p
of
N
.
Moreover:
Relative
to
the
relationship
“α[pN
;
p
]”
parametrized
by
pN
,
the
data
(submodule/generator)
on
N
determined
by
L,N
|pN
;
γ,N
|pN
are
multiplicative/canonical
at
the
“basepoint”
p
of
N
.

THEORY

In
other
words:
By
allowing,
in
eﬀect,
the
“basepoint
in
question”
to
vary,
we
obtain
globally
canonical
data
in
the
sense
that
L,N
|pN
;
γ,N
|pN
are
always
canonical,
relative
to
the
basepoint
parametrized
by
pN
.
This
is
the
reason
why
it
is
necesary
to
introduce
the
“reference
universe”
—
i.e.,
in
order
to
have
an
alternative
arena
in
which
to
consider
a
“distinct,
independent
basepoint”
(i.e.,
p
)
from
the
“original
basepoint”
p
of
N
,
relative
to
which
the
data
in
question
becomes
canonical.
Note
that
once
one
introduces
a
distinct,
independent
reference
universe,
it
is
a
tautology
—
by
essentially
the
same
reasoning
as
that
of
“Russell’s
paradox”
concerning
the
“set
of
all
sets”
—
that
all
possible
relationships
“α[pN
;
p
]”
between
these
two
universes
do,
in
fact,
occur.
We
refer
to
the
ﬁgure
below
for
a
pictorial
representation
of
the
situation
just
described:
