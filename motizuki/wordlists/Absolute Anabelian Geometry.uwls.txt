Introduction
Let
XK
be
a
hyperbolic
curve
(cf.
§0
below)
over
a
ﬁeld
K
of
characteristic
0.
Denote
its
algebraic
fundamental
group
by
ΠXK
.
Thus,
we
have
a
natural
surjection
ΠXK

GK
of
ΠXK
onto
the
absolute
Galois
group
GK
of
K.
When
K
is
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Q
or
Qp
,
and
one
holds
GK
ﬁxed,
then
it
is
known
(cf.
[Tama1],
[Mzk6];
Theorem
1.3.4
of
the
present
manuscript)
that
one
may
recover
the
curve
XK
in
a
functorial
fashion
from
ΠXK
.
This
sort
of
result
may
be
thought
of
as
a
“relative
result”
(i.e.,
over
GK
).
Then
the
question
naturally
arises:
To
what
extent
are
the
“absolute
analogues”
of
this
result
valid
—
i.e.,
what
if
one
does
not
hold
GK
ﬁxed?
If
K
is
a
number
ﬁeld,
then
it
is
still
possible
to
recover
XK
from
ΠXK
(cf.
Corollary
1.3.5),
by
applying
the
theorem
of
Neukirch-Uchida
(cf.
Theorem
1.1.3).
On
the
other
1

hand,
when
K
is
a
p-adic
local
ﬁeld
(i.e.,
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp),
the
analogue
of
the
theorem
of
Neukirch-Uchida
fails
to
hold,
and
indeed,
it
is
the
opinion
of
the
author
at
the
time
of
writing
that
it
is
unlikely
(in
the
p-adic
local
case)
that
one
can
recover
XK
in
general
(i.e.,
in
the
fashion
of
Corollary
1.3.5)
from
ΠXK
.
In
the
present
manuscript,
we
begin
by
reviewing/surveying
in
§1
the
anabelian
geometry
of
number
ﬁelds,
p-adic
local
ﬁelds,
and
hyperbolic
curves
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
goal
of
understanding
to
what
extent
the
anabelian
geometry
of
hyperbolic
curves
over
p-adic
local
ﬁelds
can
be
made
“absolute”.
Our
main
result
(Theorem
2.7),
given
in
§2,
states
that
when
K
is
a
p-adic
local
ﬁeld,
(although
we
may
be
unable
to
recover
XK
itself)
one
may
recover
(in
a
functorial
fashion)
the
special
ﬁber
of
XK
,
together
with
its
natural
log
structure,
in
an
absolute
fashion,
i.e.,
solely
from
the
isomorphism
class
of
the
proﬁnite
group
ΠXK
.

a

for
the

of

Note
that:
(i)
ZG
(H),
NG
(H)
and
CG
(H)
are
subgroups
of
G;
(ii)
we
have
inclusions
H,
ZG
(H)
⊆
NG
(H)
⊆
CG
(H)
and
(iii)
H
is
normal
in
NG
(H).
Note
that
ZG
(H),
NG
(H)
are
always
closed
in
G,
while
CG
(H)
is
not
necessarily
closed
in
G.
Indeed,
one
may
construct
such
an
example
as
follows:
Let
def
M
=

Zp
N
endowed
with
the
product
topology
(of
the
various
copies
of
Zp
equipped
with
their
usual
topology).
Thus,
M
is
a
Hausdorﬀ
topological
group.
For
n
∈
N,
write
F
n
(M)
⊆
M
for
the
sub-topological
group
given
by
the
product
of
the
copies
of
Zp
indexed
by
m
≥
n.
Write
AutF
(M)
for
the
set
of
automorphisms
of
the
topological
group
M
that
preserve
the
ﬁltration
F
∗
(M)
on
M.
If
α
∈
AutF
(M),
then
for
every
n
∈
N,
α
induces
a
continuous
homomorphism
αn
:
M/F
n
(M)
→
M/F
n
(M)
which
is
clearly
surjective,
hence
an
isomorphism
(since
M/F
n
(M)
is
proﬁnite
and
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated
—
cf.
[FJ],
Proposition
15.3).
It
thus
follows
that
α
induces
an
isomorphism
∼
F
n
(M)
→
F
n
(M),
hence
that
the
inverse
of
α
also
lies
in
AutF
(M).
In
particular,
we
conclude
that
AutF
(M)
is
a
group.
Equip
AutF
(M)
with
the
coarsest
topology
for
which
all
of
the
homomorphisms
AutF
(M)
→
Aut(M/F
n
(M))
(where
Aut(M/F
n
(M))
∼
=
GLn
(Zp
)
is
equipped
with
its
usual
topology)
are
continuous.
Note
that
relative
to
this
topology,
AutF
(M)
forms
a
Hausdorﬀ
topological
group.
Now
deﬁne
G
to
be
the
semi-direct
product
of
M
with
AutF
(M)
(so
G
is
a
Hausdorﬀ
topological
group),
and
H
to
be


pn
·
Zp
⊆
Zp
=
M
n∈N
N
(so
H
⊆
G
is
a
closed
subgroup).
Then
CG
(H)
is
not
closed
in
G.
For
instance,
if
one

denotes
by
en
∈
N
Zp
the
vector
with
a
1
in
the
n-th
place
and
zeroes
elsewhere,
then
the
limit
A∞
(where
def
A∞
(en
)
=
en
+
en+1
def
for
all
n
∈
N)
of
the
automorphisms
Am
∈
CG
(H)
(where
Am
(en
)
=
en
+en+1
if
n
≤
m,
def
Am
(en
)
=
en
if
n
>
m)
is
not
contained
in
CG
(H).
Deﬁnition
0.1.
(i)
Let
G
be
a
proﬁnite
group.
Then
we
shall
say
that
G
is
slim
if
the
centralizer
ZG
(H)
of
any
open
subgroup
H
⊆
G
in
G
is
trivial.
4

(ii)
We
shall
say
that
a
continuous
homomorphism
of
proﬁnite
groups
G
→
H
is
relatively
slim
if
the
centralizer
in
H
of
the
image
of
every
open
subgroup
of
G
is
trivial.
(iii)
We
shall
say
that
a
closed
subgroup
H
⊆
G
of
a
proﬁnite
group
G
is
commensurably
(respectively,
normally)
terminal
if
the
commensurator
CG
(H)
(respectively,
normalizer
NG
(H))
is
equal
to
H.
Remark
0.1.1.
Thus,
a
proﬁnite
group
G
is
slim
if
and
only
if
the
identity
morphism
G
→
G
is
relatively
slim.
Moreover,
if
H
⊆
G
is
a
closed
subgroup
such
that
the
inclusion
H
→
G
is
relatively
slim,
then
both
H
and
G
are
slim.
Remark
0.1.2.
It
is
a
formal
consequence
of
the
deﬁnitions
that:
commensurably
terminal
=⇒
normally
terminal
and
that
(if
H
⊆
G
is
a
closed
subgroup
of
a
proﬁnite
group
G,
then):
H
⊆
G
commensurably
terminal,
H
slim
=⇒
the
inclusion
H
→
G
is
relatively
slim
Remark
0.1.3.
It
was
pointed
out
to
the
author
by
F.
Oort
that
a
proﬁnite
group
is
slim
if
and
only
if
every
open
subgroup
of
G
has
trivial
center.
(Indeed,
the
necessity
of
this
condition
is
clear.
Its
suﬃciency
may
be
shown
as
follows:
If
H
⊆
G
is
an
open
subgroup,
then
for
any
h
∈
ZG
(H),
let
H

⊆
G
by
the
(necessarily
open)
subgroup
generated
by
H
and
h.
Thus,
h
lies
in
the
center
of
H

,
which
is
trivial
by
assumption.)
This
property
of
a
proﬁnite
group
—
i.e.,
that
every
open
subgroup
be
center-free
—
was
investigated
in
detail
in
[Naka1](cf.,
e.g.,
Corollaries
1.3.3,
1.3.4).
Curves:
Suppose
that
g
≥
0
is
an
integer.
Then
a
family
of
curves
of
genus
g
X→S
is
deﬁned
to
be
a
smooth,
proper,
geometrically
connected
morphism
X
→
S
whose
geometric
ﬁbers
are
curves
of
genus
g.
Suppose
that
g,
r
≥
0
are
integers
such
that
2g
−
2
+
r
>
0.
We
shall
denote
the
moduli
stack
of
r-pointed
stable
curves
of
genus
g
(where
we
assume
the
points
to
be
unordered)
by
Mg,r
(cf.
[DM],
[Knud]
for
an
exposition
of
the
theory
of
such
curves;
strictly
speaking,
[Knud]
treats
the
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
Mg,r
determined
by
ordering
ABSOLUTE

the
marked
points).
The
open
substack
Mg,r
⊆
Mg,r
of
smooth
curves
will
be
referred
to
as
the
moduli
stack
of
smooth
r-pointed
stable
curves
of
genus
g
or,
alternatively,
as
the
moduli
stack
of
hyperbolic
curves
of
type
(g,
r).
A
family
of
hyperbolic
curves
of
type
(g,
r)
X→S
is
deﬁned
to
be
a
morphism
which
factors
X
→
Y
→
S
as
the
composite
of
an
open
immersion
X
→
Y
onto
the
complement
Y
\D
of
a
relative
divisor
D
⊆
Y
which
is
ﬁnite
étale
over
S
of
relative
degree
r,
and
a
family
Y
→
S
of
curves
of
genus
g.
One
checks
easily
that,
if
S
is
normal,
then
the
pair
(Y,
D)
is
unique
up
to
canonical
isomorphism.
(Indeed,
when
S
is
the
spectrum
of
a
ﬁeld,
this
fact
is
well-known
from
the
elementary
theory
of
algebraic
curves.
Next,
we
consider
an
arbitrary
connected
normal
S
on
which
a
prime
l
is
invertible
(which,
by
Zariski
localization,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality).
Denote
by
S

→
S
the
ﬁnite
étale
covering
parametrizing
orderings
of
the
marked
points
and
trivializations
of
the
l-torsion
points
of
the
Jacobian
of
Y
.
Note
that
S

→
S
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
(Y,
D),
since
(by
the
normality
of
S),
S

may
be
constructed
as
the
normalization
of
S
in
the
function
ﬁeld
of
S

(which
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
(Y,
D)
since
the
restriction
of
(Y,
D)
to
the
generic
point
of
S
has
already
been
shown
to
be
unique).
Thus,
the
uniqueness
of
(Y,
D)
follows
by
considering
the
classifying
morphism
(associated
to
(Y,
D))
from
S

to
the
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
(Mg,r
)Z[

]
parametrizing
orderings
of
the
marked
points
and
trivializations
of
the
ltorsion
points
of
the
Jacobian
[since
this
covering
is
well-known
to
be
a
scheme,
for
l
suﬃciently
large].)
We
shall
refer
to
Y
(respectively,
D;
D;
D)
as
the
compactiﬁcation
(respectively,
divisor
at
inﬁnity;

A

to

is
a

Geometry
§1.1.
The
Anabelian
Geometry
of
Number
Fields
In
this
§,
we
review
well-known
anabelian
(and
related)
properties
of
the
Galois
groups
of
number
ﬁelds
and
(mainly
p-adic)
local
ﬁelds.
Let
F
be
a
number
ﬁeld.
Fix
an
algebraic
closure
F
of
F
and
denote
the
resulting
absolute
Galois
group
of
F
by
GF
.
Let
p
be
a
(not
necessarily
nonarchimedean!)
prime
of
F
.
Write
Gp
⊆
GF
for
the
decomposition
group
(well-deﬁned
up
to
conjugacy)
6
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
associated
to
p
and
Fp
for
the
completion
of
F
at
p.
Then
we
have
the
following
result
(cf.
also
Corollary
1.3.3
below
for
a
generalization
of
the
slimness
of
Gp
,
GF
):
Theorem
1.1.1.
(Slimness
and
Commensurable
Terminality)
Suppose
that
p
is
nonarchimedean.
Then:
(i)
The
closed
subgroup
Gp
⊆
GF
is
commensurably
terminal.
(ii)
The
inclusion
Gp
→
GF
is
relatively
slim.
In
particular,
Gp
,
GF
are
slim.
Proof.
Assertion
(i)
is
a
formal
consequence
of
[NSW],
Corollary
12.1.3.
As
for
assertion
(ii),
the
slimness
of
Gp
follows
from
local
class
ﬁeld
theory
(cf.,
e.g.,
[Serre2]).
(That
is,
if
σ
∈
Gp
commutes
with
an
open
subgroup
H
⊆
Gp
,
then
σ
induces
the
trivial
action
on
the
abelianization
H
ab
.
But,
by
local
class
ﬁeld
theory,
H
ab
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
proﬁnite
completion
of
K
×
,
where
K
is
the
ﬁnite
extension
of
Fp
determined
by
H.
Thus,
σ
acts
trivially
on
all
suﬃciently
large
ﬁnite
extensions
K
of
Fp
,
so
σ
=
1,
as
desired.)
Relative
slimness
thus
follows
formally
from
the
slimness
of
Gp
and
(i)
(cf.
Remark
0.1.2).
Theorem
1.1.2.
(Topologically
Finitely
Generated
Closed
Normal
Subgroups)
Every
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated
closed
normal
subgroup
of
GF
is
trivial.
Proof.
This
follows
from
[FJ],
Theorem
15.10.
Theorem
1.1.3.
(The
Neukirch-Uchida
Theorem
on
the
Anabelian
Nature
of
Number
Fields)
Let
F1
,
F2
be
number
ﬁelds.
Let
F
1
(respectively,
F
2
)
be
an
algebraic
closure
of
F1
(respectively,
F2
).
Write
Isom(F
2
/F2
,
F
1
/F1
)
for
the
set
of
ﬁeld
∼
isomorphisms
F
2
→
F
1
that
map
F2
onto
F1
.
Then
the
natural
map
Isom(F
2
/F2
,
F
1
/F1
)
→
Isom(Gal(F
1
/F1
),
Gal(F
2
/F2
))
is
bijective.
Proof.
This
is
the
content
of
[NSW],
Theorem
12.2.1.
Remark
1.1.3.1.
It
is
important
to
note,
however,
that
the
analogue
of
Theorem
1.1.3
for
ﬁnite
extensions
of
Qp
is
false
(cf.
[NSW],
p.
674).
Nevertheless,
by
considering
isomorphisms
of
Galois
groups
that
preserve
the
higher
ramiﬁcation
ﬁltration,
one
may
obtain
a
partial
analogue
of
this
theorem
for
p-adic
local
ﬁelds
(cf.
[Mzk5]).
ABSOLUTE
ANABELIAN

Next,
we
would
like
to
consider
a
situation
that
arises
frequently
in
anabelian
geometry.
Suppose
that
G
is
equal
to
GF
or
Gp
(where
we
assume
now
that
p
is
nonarchimedean!),
and
that
we
are
given
an
exact
sequence
of
proﬁnite
groups:
1→Δ→Π→G→1
Suppose,
moreover,

Suppose

Next,
let
us
observe
that
we
have
an
exact
sequence
0
→
Im(Δ
)
→
(Π
)ab
→
(G
)ab
→
0

Note,
(where
Im(Δ
)
is
the
image
of
Δ
in
(Π
)ab
)
of
ﬁnitely
generated
Z-modules.



moreover,
that
we
have
a
natural
surjection
Q

Im(Δ
)/(torsion)
(where
Q
is
as
in
(∗)).
On
the
other
hand,
it
follows
formally
from
our
assumption
that
Π

G
splits
over
an
open
subgroup
of
G
(together
with
the
well-known
fact
that
the
group
cohomology
of
a
ﬁnite
group
is
always
annihilated
by
the
order
to
the
group)
that
this
natural
surjection
is,
in
fact,
an
isomorphism.
In
particular,
it
follows
formally
from
(∗)
that:
dimQp
((Π
)ab
⊗Z
Qp
)−dimQl
((Π
)ab
⊗Z
Ql
)
=
dimQp
((G
)ab
⊗Z
Qp
)−dimQl
((G
)ab
⊗Z
Ql
)
Thus,
to
complete
the
proof
of
Lemma
1.1.4,
it
suﬃces
to
prove
that:
[K

:
Qp
]
=
dimQp
((G
)ab
⊗Z
Qp
)
−
dimQl
((G
)ab
⊗Z
Ql
)
But
this
is
a
formal
consequence
of
local
class
ﬁeld
theory
(cf.,
e.g.,
[Serre2];
§1.2
below),
i.e.,
the
fact
that
(G
)ab
is
isomorphic
to
the
proﬁnite
completion
of
(K

)×
.
Typically,
in
applications
involving
hyperbolic
curves,
one
shows
that
the
condition
(∗)
of
Lemma
1.1.4
is
satisﬁed
by
applying
the
following:
Lemma
1.1.5.
(Tate
Modules
of
Semi-abelian
Varieties)
Let
K
be
a
ﬁnite
def
extension
of
Qp
.
Fix
an
algebraic
closure
K
of
K;
write
GK
=
Gal(K/K).
Let
A
be
a
semi-abelian
variety
over
K.
Denote
the
resulting
(proﬁnite)
Tate
module
of
A
by:
def
T
(A)
=
Hom(Q/Z,
A(K))
Then
the
maximal
torsion-free
quotient
T
(A)

Q
on
which
GK
acts
trivially
is
a

ﬁnitely
generated
free
Z-module.
Proof.
A
semi-abelian
variety
is
an
extension
of
an
abelian
variety
by
a
torus.
Thus,
T
(A)
is
the
extension
of
the
Tate
module
of
an
abelian
variety
by
the
Tate
module
of
a
torus.
Moreover,
since
(after
restricting
to
some
open
subgroup
of
GK
)
the
Tate
module

of
a
torus
is
isomorphic
to
the
direct
sum
of
a
ﬁnite
number
of
copies
of
Z(1),
we
thus
conclude
that
the
image
of
the
Tate
module
of
the
torus
in
Q
is
necessarily
zero.
In
particular,
we
may
assume
for
the
remainder
of
the
proof
without
loss
of
generality
that
A
is
an
abelian
variety.

Now
it
follows
from
the
theory
of
[FC](cf.,
in
particular,
[FC],
Chapter
III,
Corollary
7.3),
that
T
(A)
ﬁts
into
exact
sequences
(of
GK
-modules)
0
→
Tgood
→
T
(A)
→
Tcom
→
0
0
→
Ttrc
→
Tgood
→
T
(B)
→
0
where
T
(B)
is
the
Tate
module
of
an
abelian
variety
B
over
K
with
potentially
good

Ttrc
=
Mtrc
⊗Z
Z(1)

reduction;
and
Tcom
=
Mcom
⊗Z
Z,
for
ﬁnitely
generated
free
Zmodules
Mcom
,
Mtrc
on
which
GK
acts
via
a
ﬁnite
quotient.
[Here,
“com”
(respectively,
“trc”)
stands
for
“combinatorial”
(respectively,
“toric”).]
It
is
thus
evident
that
Ttrc
maps
to
0
in
Q.
Moreover,
by
[Mzk4],
Lemma
8.1
(the
proof
of
which
is
valid
for
arbitrary
B,
even
though
in
loc.
cit.,
this
result
is
only
stated
in
the
case
of
a
Jacobian),
and
the
Riemann
Hypothesis
for
abelian
varieties
over
ﬁnite
ﬁelds
(cf.,
e.g.,
[Mumf],
p.
206),
it
follows
that
T
(B)
also
maps
to
0
in
Q.
Thus,
we
conclude
that
Q
is
equal
to

is
Z-ﬂat,
the
maximal
torsion-free
quotient
of
Tcom
on
which
GK
acts
trivially.
Since
Z

to
the
maximal
however,
this
implies
that
Q
is
equal
to
the
result
of
applying
⊗Z
Z
torsion-free
quotient
of
Mcom
on
which
GK
acts
trivially.
But
this
last
quotient
is
manifestly
ﬁnitely
generated
and
free
over
Z.
This
completes
the
proof.
§1.2.
The
Anabelian
Geometry
of
p-adic
Local
Fields
In
this
§,
we
review
certain
well-known
“group-theoretic”
properties
of
Galois
groups
of
p-adic
local
ﬁelds,
i.e.,
properties
preserved
by
arbitrary
isomorphisms
between
such
Galois
groups.
For
i
=
1,
2,
let
pi
be
a
prime
number.
Let
Ki
be
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qpi
.
We
denote
the
ring
of
integers
(respectively,
maximal
ideal;
residue
ﬁeld)
of
Ki
by
OKi
(respectively,
mKi
;
ki

Also,
we
assume
that
we
have
chosen
an
algebraic
closures
K
i
of
Ki
and
write
def
GKi
=
Gal(K
i
/Ki
)
for
the
corresponding
absolute
Galois
group
of
Ki
.
Thus,
by
local
class
ﬁeld
theory
(cf.,
e.g.,
[Serre2]),
we
have
a
natural
isomorphism
∼
(Ki×
)∧

(where
the
“∧”
denotes
the

of

“×”
denotes
the

of

of
a
ring;
and
“ab”
denotes
the
maximal
abelian
quotient
of
a
topological
group).
In
particular,
Gab
Ki
ﬁts
into
an

Before
proceeding,
we
observe
that
Proposition
1.2.1,
(i),
may
be
extended
as
follows:
Write

def
AQ
=
|Spec(Z)|
{∞}
(where
“|
−
|”
denotes
the
underlying
set
of
a
scheme)
for
the
set
of
“all
arithmetic
def
primes
of
Q”.
If
v
∈
AQ
is
equal
to
(0)
∈
|Spec(Z)|
(respectively,
∞),
set
Gv
=
GQ
def
(respectively,
Gv
=
Gal(C/R)).
If
v
∈
|Spec(Z)|
⊆
AQ
is
equal
to
the
prime
determined
def
by
a
prime
number
p,
set
Gv
=
GQp
.
Proposition
1.2.2.
(Intrinsicity
of
Arithmetic
Types)
For
i
=
1,
2,
let
vi
∈
AQ
.
Suppose
that
Hi
is
an
open
subgroup
of
Gvi
.
Then
H1
∼
=
H2
implies
v1
=
v2
.
Proof.
Indeed,
open
subgroups
of
GQ
may
be
distinguished
by
the
fact
that
their
abelianizations
fail
to
be
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated.
(Indeed,
consider
the
abelian
extensions
arising
from
adjoining
roots
of
unity.)
By
contrast,
abelianizations
of
open
subgroups
of
GR
or
GQp
(cf.
the
above
discussion)
are
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated.
Next,
open
subgroups
of
GR
may
be
distinguished
from
those
of
any
GQp
by
the
fact
they
are
ﬁnite.
The
remainder
of
Proposition
1.2.2
follows
from
Proposition
1.2.1,
(i).
Next,
let
us
write
Spec(OKi
)log
for
the
log
scheme
obtained
by
equipping
the
scheme
Spec(OKi
)
with
the
log
structure
deﬁned
by
the
divisor
V
(mKi
).
Thus,
by
pulling
back
this
log
structure
via
the
natural
morphism
Spec(ki
)
→
Spec(OKi
),
we
obtain
a
log
scheme
Spec(ki
)log
,
which
we
denote
by
kilog
for
short.
Note
that
the
“étale
monoid”
that
deﬁnes
the
log
structure
on
kilog
“admits
a
global
chart”
in
the
sense
that
it
is
deﬁned
by
a
single
constant
monoid
(in
the
Zariski
topology
of
Spec(ki
))
Mklog
,
which
ﬁts
into
a
natural
exact
sequence
(of

Thus,
the
ki×
-torsor

determined
by
considering
the
inverse
image
of

N
in
this
sequence
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
ki×
-torsor
of
uniformizers
∈
mKi
considered
modulo
m2Ki
.
Next,
let
us
write
GKi

Glog

ABSOLUTE
ANABELIAN
GEOMETRY
13
for
the
quotient
deﬁned
by
the
maximal
tamely
ramiﬁed
extension
Kitame
of
Ki
.
Thus,
log
Glog
ki
may
also
be
thought
of
as
the
“logarithmic
fundamental
group”
π1
(ki
)
of
the
log
scheme
kilog
.
Moreover,
Glog
ki
ﬁts
into
a
natural
exact
sequence:

1
→
μZ
(ki
)
→
Glog
ki
→
Z
→
1
where,
just
as
in
the
case
of
Ki
,
we
write:
def

μZ
(k

)
=
μZ
(k

)
=
Hom(Q/Z,
k

);
def
μQ/Z
(k

)
=
μZ
(k

)
⊗Z
Q/Z
The
“abelianization”
of
this
exact
sequence
yields
an
exact
sequence:
ab

1
→
ki×
→
(Glog

)
Now
we
have
the
following:
Proposition
1.2.3.
∼
(i)
Any
isomorphism
α
:
GK1
→
GK2
(as
in
Proposition
1.2.1)
induces
an
isomor∼
log
phism
Glog
k1
→
Gk2
between
the
respective
quotients.
(ii)
There
is
a
natural
isomorphism
of
ki×
-torsors
between
the
torsor
of

=
k

above
and
the

Z
i
Z
(k

))
=
HomZ
(μZ
(k

μZ
(k

This
isomorphism
is
deﬁned
by
associating
to
a
uniformizer
π
∈
Ui
the
μZ
(k
i
)-torsor
over
kilog
determined
by
the
roots
π
1/N
,
as
N
ranges
(multiplicatively)
over
the
positive
integers
prime
to
pi
.
(iii)
The
proﬁnite
group
Glog
ki
is
slim.
Proof.
Property
(i)
follows
from
Proposition
1.2.1,
(ii),
together
with
the
fact
that
the
quotient
GKi

Glog
ki
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
quotient
of
GKi
by
the
(unique)
maximal
pro-p
subgroup
of
IKi
.
Next,
since
any
morphism
of
ki×
-torsors
is
necessarily
an
isomorphism,
property
(ii)
follows
by
observing
that
the
stated
association
of
coverings
to
uniformizers
is
indeed
a
morphism
of
ki×
-torsors
—
a
tautology,
which
may
by
veriﬁed
by
considering
the
case
N
=
qi
−
1
(where
qi
is
the
cardinality
of
ki
),
in
which
case
this
tautology
amounts
to
the
computation:
(ζ
1/N
)qi
=
ζ
·
(ζ
1/N
)
(for
ζ
∈
ki×
).
Finally,
property
(iii)
follows
formally
from
the
fact
that
the
quotient
Glog
ki
/Im(μZ
(k
i
))
is
inﬁnite
and
acts
faithfully
on
all
open
subgroups
of
the
closed
subgroup
Im(μZ
(k
i
))
⊆
Glog
ki
.
In
the
following,
let
us
denote
by
(kilog
)∼
→
kilog
the
“universal
covering”
of
kilog
deﬁned
by
the
extension
Kitame
of
Ki
.
Thus,
Glog
ki
acts
naturally
as
the
group
of
covering

∼
log
transformations
of

(The

Suppose
that

given
an

Then:
(i)
We
have:
|k1

=

p1
=

Thus,
(in
the
remainder
of
this

and

we
shall
write
p

(ii)
λ

Assume
further
that

from

and
the

are

for
which
the

Proof.
Property
(i)
follows
by
observing
that
pi
is
the
unique
prime
number
such
ab
that
1
plus
the
cardinality
of
the

subgroup
of

i.e.,
the

of

—
is
equal
to
a
power
of
pi
.
Property
(ii)
follows
by
thinking
of
the
quotients

Glog

as
the
quotients
of
Gki
obtained
by
forming
the

by
its

and
then
using
that
the
Frobenius

is
the
unique

that
acts
on
the
abelian
group
Im(μZ

via
multiplication
by
|k1

=

As
for
(iii),
the
morphism
σ

is
the
unique
logarithmic
extension
of
σ
whose
induced
morphism
∼
U1

is
the

The

obtained
by

this

to
the

Here,
the

Finally,
the

a
formal
consequence

fact
that

§1.3.
The
Anabelian
Geometry
of
Hyperbolic
Curves
Characteristic
Zero:
Let
K
be
a
ﬁeld
of
characteristic
0
whose
absolute
Galois
group
is
slim.
Let
X
be
def
a
hyperbolic
curve
of
type
(g,
r)
over
S
=
Spec(K).
Fix
an
algebraic
closure
K
of
K
def
and
write
s
:
Spec(K)
→
S;
GK
=
Gal(K/K).
Let
x
∈
X(K)
be
a
K-valued
point
of
def
X
lying
over
s.
Then,
setting
ΠX
=
π1
(X,
x),
we
obtain
an
exact
sequence
1
→
ΔX
→
ΠX
→
GK
→
1
which
determines
a
well-deﬁned
continous
homomorphism
GK
→
Out(ΔX
)
to
the
group
of
outer
automorphisms
Out(ΔX
)
of
ΔX
.
Lemma
1.3.1.
(Slimness
of
Geometric
and
Arithmetic
Fundamental
Groups)
The
proﬁnite
groups
ΔX
,
ΠX
are
slim.
Proof.
The
slimness
of
ΠX
is
a
formal
consequence
of
the
slimness
of
ΔX
and
our
assumption
that
GK
is
slim.
Thus,
it
remains
to
prove
that
ΔX
is
slim.
One
approach
to
proving
this
fact
is
given
in
[Naka1],
Corollary
1.3.4.
Another
approach
is
the
following:
Let
H
⊆
ΔX
be
an
open
normal
subgroup
for
which
the
associated
covering
def
XH
→
XK
=
X
×K
K
is
such
that
XH
is
a
curve
of
genus
≥
2.
Thus,
H
ab
may
be
thought
of
as
the
proﬁnite
Tate
module
associated
to
the
generalized
Jacobian
of
the
singular
curve
obtained
from
the
unique
smooth
compactiﬁcation
of
XH
by
identifying
the
various
cusps
(i.e.,
points
of
the
compactiﬁcation
not
lying
in
XH
)
to
a
single
point.
In
particular,
if
conjugation
by
an
element
δ
∈
ΔX
induces
the
trivial
action
on
H
ab
,
then
we
conclude
that
the
image
of
δ
in
ΔX
/H
induces
the
trivial
action
on
the
generalized
Jacobian
just
discussed,
hence
on
XH
itself.
But
this
implies
that
δ
∈
H.
By
taking
H
to
be
suﬃciently
small,
we
thus
conclude
that
δ
=
1.
16

In
particular,
it
follows
formally
from
Lemma
1.3.1
that:
Corollary
1.3.2.
(A
Natural
Exact
Sequence)
We
have
a
natural
exact
sequence
of
proﬁnite
groups:
1
→
ΔX
→
Aut(ΔX
)
→
Out(ΔX
)
→
1
In
particular,
by
pulling
back
this
exact
sequence,
one
may
recover
the
exact
sequence
1
→
ΔX
→
ΠX
→
GK
→
1
entirely
group-theoretically
from
the
outer
Galois
representation
GK
→
Out(ΔX
).
One
example
of
the
sort
of
“K”
under
consideration
is
the
case
of
a
“sub-p-adic
ﬁeld”:
Corollary
1.3.3.
(Slimness
of
Sub-p-adic
Fields)
The
absolute
Galois
group
of
a
sub-p-adic
ﬁeld
(i.e.,
a
ﬁeld
isomorphic
to
a
subﬁeld
of
a
ﬁnitely
generated
ﬁeld
extension
of
Qp
,
for
some
prime
number
p)
is
slim.
Proof.
This
fact
is
implied
by
the
argument
of
the
proof
of
[Mzk6],
Lemma
15.8.
In
[Mzk6],
the
author
(essentially)
proved
the
following
result
(cf.
[Mzk6],
Theorem
A,
for
a
stronger
version
that
treats
arbitrary
dominant
morphisms
and
open
group
homomorphisms
[i.e.,
which
are
not
necessarily
isomorphisms]):
Theorem
1.3.4.
(“Sub-p-adic
Proﬁnite
Grothendieck
Conjecture”)
Suppose
that
K
is
a
sub-p-adic
ﬁeld,
and
that
X
and
Y
are
hyperbolic
curves
over
K.
Denote
∼
by
IsomK
(X,
Y
)
the
set
of
K-isomorphisms
X
→
Y
;
by
IsomOut
GK
(ΔX

)
the
set
of
outer
isomorphisms
between
the
two
proﬁnite
groups
in
parentheses
that
are
compatible
with
the
respective
outer
actions
of
GK
.
Then
the
natural
map
IsomK
(X,
Y
)
→
IsomOut
GK
(ΔX
,
ΔY
)
is
bijective.
Thus,
by
combining
Theorems
1.1.3;
1.3.4;
Lemma
1.1.4,
(i),
we
obtain
the
following:
Corollary
1.3.5.
(Absolute

Let
K,
L
be

ﬁelds;
X
(respectively,
Y

a

over

(re∼
spectively,
L).
Denote
by
Isom(X,

)
the
set
of

isomorphisms

;
by
ABSOLUTE

IsomOut
(ΠX

)
the
set

in

Then
the
natural
map
Isom(X,
Y
)
→
IsomOut
(ΠX
,
ΠY
)
is
bijective.
Remark
1.3.5.1.
Since
the
analogue
of
Theorem
1.1.3
in
the
p-adic
local
case
is
false,
it
seems
unlikely
to
the
author
at
the
time
of
writing
that
the
analogue
of
Corollary
1.3.5
should
hold
over
p-adic
local
ﬁelds.
Remark
1.3.5.2.
In
fact,
the
statement
of
Corollary
1.3.5
holds
when
K
is
taken
to
be
an
arbitrary
ﬁnitely
generated
ﬁeld
extension
of
Q.
This
follows
by
applying
a
theorem
of
F.
Pop
(in
place
of
the
Neukirch-Uchida
theorem)
—
cf.
the
discussion
on
[NSW],
p.
677,
for
more
details.
One
interesting
result
in
the
present
context
is
the
following,
due
to
M.
Matsumoto
(cf.
[Mtmo],
Theorems
2.1,
2.2):
Theorem
1.3.6.
(Kernels
of
Outer
Galois
Representations)
Let
X
be
an
aﬃne
hyperbolic
curve
over
a
sub-complex
ﬁeld
K
—
i.e.,
a
ﬁeld
isomorphic
to
a
subﬁeld
of
the
ﬁeld
of
complex
numbers.
Then
the
kernel
of
the
resulting
outer
Galois
representation
GK
→
Out(ΔX
)
is
contained
in
the
kernel
of
the
natural
homomorphism
GK
→
GQ
.
Remark
1.3.6.1.
Thus,
in
particular,
when
K
is
a
number
ﬁeld,
the
homomorphism
GK
→
Out(ΔX
)
is
injective.
This
injectivity
was
ﬁrst
proven
by
Belyi
in
the
case
of
hyperbolic
curves
of
type
(g,
r)
=
(0,
3).
It
was
then
conjectured
by
Voevodskii
to
be
true
for
all
(hyperbolic)
(g,
r)
and
proven
by
Voevodskii
to
be
true
for
g
=
1.
Finally,
it
was
proven
by
Matsumoto
to
hold
for
all
(g,
r)
such
that
r
>
0.
To
the
knowledge
of
the
author,
the
proper
case
remains
open
at
the
time
of
writing.
We
refer
to
the
discussion
surrounding
[Mtmo],
Theorem
2.1,
for
more
details
on
this
history.
Remark
1.3.6.2.
One
interesting
aspect
of
the
homomorphism
appearing
in
Theorem
1.3.6
is
that
it
allows
one
to
interpret
Theorem
1.3.4
(when
X
=
Y
)
as
a
computation
of
the
centralizer
of
the
image
of
this
homomorphism
GK
→
Out(ΔX
).
This
point
of
view
is
surveyed
in
detail
in
[Naka2].

SHINICHI

Next,
we
would
like
to
discuss
various
properties
of
the
inertia
groups
of
the
cusps
def
of
a
hyperbolic
curve.
For
every
cusp
x
of
XK
=
X
×K
K
—
i.e.,
point
of
the
unique
smooth
compactiﬁcation
of
XK
over
K
that
does
not
lie
in
XK
—
we
have
an
associated

inertia
group
(abstractly
isomorphic
to
Z)
Ix
⊆
Δ
X
(well-deﬁned,
up
to
conjugation).
If
l
is
any
prime
number,
then
let
us
denote
the
maximal
pro-l
quotient
of
a
proﬁnite
group
by
means
of
a
superscript
“(l)”.
Thus,
we
(l)
(l)
also
obtain
an
inertia
group
Ix
⊆
ΔX
(abstractly
isomorphic
to
Zl
).
Lemma
1.3.7.
(Commensurable
Terminality
of
Inertia
Groups)
The
sub(l)
(l)
groups
Ix
⊆
ΔX
,
Ix
⊆
ΔX
are
commensurably
terminal.
Proof.
Indeed,
let
σ
be
an
element
of
the
commensurator.
If
the
asserted
commensurable
terminality
is
false,
then
by
projecting
to
a
ﬁnite
quotient,
we
may
assume
that
we
have
a
ﬁnite
Galois
covering
Z
→
XK
(of
degree
a
power
of
l
in
the
pro-l
case),
together
with
a
cusp
z
of
Z
such
that:
(i)
z
maps
to
x;
(ii)
z
=
z
σ
;
(iii)
z,
z
σ
have
conjugate
inertia
groups
in
ΔZ
.
We
may
also
assume
(by
taking
ΔZ
⊆
ΔX
to
be
suﬃciently
small)
that
Z
has
genus
≥
2
and
admits
a
cusp
z

=
z,
z
σ
.
Then
it
is
easy
to
see
that
Z
admits
an
inﬁnite
abelian
(pro-l,
in
the
pro-l
case)
covering
which
is
totally
ramiﬁed
at
z,
z

,
but
not
at
z
σ
.
But
this
contradicts
property

Remark
1.3.7.1.
As
was
pointed
out
to
the
author
by
the
referee,
in
the
case
r
≥
2,
the
assertion
of
Lemma
1.3.7
is
a
formal
consequence
of
Theorem
B
of
[HR].
Now,
let
us
assume
that
we
are
given
two
hyperbolic
curves
(Xi
)Ki
(for
i
=
1,
2),
each
deﬁned
over
a
ﬁnite
extension
Ki
of
Qpi
.
Let
us
write
qi
for
the
cardinality
of
the
residue
ﬁeld
of
Ki
.
Choose
basepoints
for
the
(Xi
)Ki
and
denote
the
resulting
fundamental
groups
by
Π(Xi
)Ki
.
Also,
let
us
denote
the
unique
proper
smooth
curve
over
Ki
that
compactiﬁes
(Xi
)Ki
by
(Yi
)Ki
.
Suppose,
moreover,
that
we
are
given
an
isomorphism
∼
αX
:
Π(X1
)K1
→
Π(X2
)K2
of
proﬁnite
groups.
Lemma
1.3.8.
(Group-Theoreticity

αX
is
necessarily
compatible

Proof.
This
follows
formally
from
Lemmas
1.1.4,
1.1.5.
Thus,
Lemma
1.3.8,
Proposition
1.2.1,
(v),
imply
that
q1
=
q2
.
Lemma
1.3.9.
(Group-Theoreticity
of
the
Cusps)
The
types
(gi
,
ri
)
of
the
hyperbolic
curves
(Xi
)Ki
coincide.
In
particular,
for
any
prime
number
l,
αX
maps
(l)
inertia
groups
of
cusps
in
ΔX1
(respectively,
ΔX1
)
to
inertia
groups
of
cusps
in
ΔX2
(l)
(respectively,
ΔX2
).
Proof.
Whether
or
not
ri
=
0
may
be
determined
by
considering
whether
or
not
ΔXi
is
free
as
a
proﬁnite
group.
When
ri
>
0,
one
may
compute
ri
by
considering
the
weight
—
i.e.,
the
number
w
such
that
the
eigenvalues
of
the
action
are
algebraic
numbers
of
archimedean
absolute
value
qiw
—
of
the
action
of
the
Frobenius
element
∈
Gki
(cf.
Proposition
1.2.1,
(iv))
as
follows:
First,
we
observe
that
(as
is
well-known)
the
weights
of
the
action
of
Frobenius
on
Δab
Xi
⊗
Ql
(where
l
is
a
prime
number
distinct
from
p1
,
1
p2
)
belong
to
the
set
{0,
1,
2
}.
(Here,
we
compute
weights
by
choosing
a
lifting
of
the
Frobenius
element
∈
Gki
to
GKi
.
Since
(as
is
well-known)
the
action
of
the
inertia
subgroup
of
GKi
on
Δab
Xi
⊗
Ql
is
quasi-unipotent
(i.e.,
unipotent
on
an
open
subgroup
of
this
inertia
subgroup),
it
follows
immediately
that
the
weights
are
independent
of
the
choice
of
lifting.)
Now
if
M
is
a
Ql
-vector
space
on
which
Frobenius
acts,
let
us
write
M
wt
w
for
the
Ql
-subspace
of
M
on
which
Frobenius
acts
with
eigenvalues
of
weight
w.
Then,
def
ab
setting
Ii
=
Ker(Δab
Xi
⊗
Ql

ΔYi
⊗
Ql
),
we
have:
ri
−
1
=
dimQl
(Ii
)
=
dimQl
(Iiwt
1
)
wt
1
wt
1
=
dimQl
(Δab
−
dimQl
(Δab
Xi
⊗
Ql
)
Yi
⊗
Ql
)
wt
1
wt
0
=
dimQl
(Δab
−
dimQl
(Δab
Xi
⊗
Ql
)
Yi
⊗
Ql
)
wt
1
wt
0
=
dimQl
(Δab
−
dimQl
(Δab
Xi
⊗
Ql
)
X
i
⊗
Ql
)
(where
the
fourth
equality
follows
from
the
auto-duality
(up
to
a
Tate
twist)
of
Δab
Yi
⊗
Ql
;
and
the
second
and
ﬁfth
equalities
follow
from
the
fact
that
Frobenius
acts
on
Ii
with
weight
1).
On
the
other
hand,
the
quantities
appearing
in
the
ﬁnal
line
of
this
sequence
of
equalities
are
all
“group-theoretic”.
Thus,
we
conclude
that
r1
=
r2
.
Since
dimQl
(Δab
Xi
⊗
Ql
)
=
2gi
−
1
+
ri
(respectively,
=
2gi
)
when
ri
>
0
(respectively,
when
ri
=
0),
this
implies
that
g1
=
g2
,
as
desired.
Finally,
the
statement
concerning
preservation
of
inertia
groups
follows
formally
from
the
fact
that
“ri
is
group-theoretic”
(by
applying
this
fact
to
coverings
of
Xi
).
20
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
Indeed,
let
l
be
a
prime
number
(possibly
equal
to
p1
or
p2
).
Since
ri
may
be
recovered
group-theoretically,
given
any
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
Zi
→
Vi
→
Xi
such
that
Zi
is
Galois,
of
degree
a
power
of
l,
over
Vi
,
one
may
determine
grouptheoretically
whether
or
not
Zi
→
Vi
is
“totally
ramiﬁed
at
a
single
point
of
Zi
and
unramiﬁed
elsewhere”,
since
this
condition
is
easily
veriﬁed
to
be
equivalent
to
the
equality:
rZi
=
deg(Zi
/Vi
)
·
(rVi
−
1)
+
1
Moreover,
the
group-theoreticity
of
this
condition
extends
immediately
to
the
case
of
pro-l
coverings
Zi
→
Vi
.
Thus,
by
Lemma
1.3.7,
we
conclude
that
the
inertia
groups
of
cusps
in
(ΔXi
)(l)
(i.e.,
the
maximal
pro-l
quotient
of
ΔXi
)
may
be
characterized
(grouptheoretically!)
as
the
maximal
subgroups
of
(ΔXi
)(l)
that
correspond
to
(proﬁnite)
coverings
satisfying
this
condition.
In
particular,
(by
Lemma
1.3.7)
the
set
of
cusps
of
Xi
may
be
reconstructed
(grouptheoretically!)
as
the
set
of
(ΔXi
)(l)
-orbits
(relative
to
the
action
via
conjugation)
of
such
inertia
groups
in
(ΔXi
)(l)
.
Thus,
by
applying
this
observation
to
arbitrary
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
Xi
,
we
recover
the
inertia
subgroups
of
the
cusps
of
ΔXi
as
the
subgroups
that
ﬁx
some
cusp
of
the
universal
covering
Xi
→
Xi
of
Xi
determined
by
the
basepoint
in
question.
This
completes
the
proof.

the

given
in
the

be

by
the

was
substantially
simpliﬁed
by

The

is
due
to

(cf.

For

let
Ki

§1.2),
and
suppose
that

(Xi

over

Let
us
ﬁx
a

basepoint
for
(Xi

and
denote
the

π1
((Xi

by

.
Suppose,
moreover,
∼
that
we
are
given
an
isomorphism
αX
:
Π(X1

and
the

that
by
Proposition
1.2.1,
(i),
this
already
implies
def
that
p1
=

;
set
p

.
That
such
a
diagram
necessarily
arises
“geometrically”
follows
from
the
main
theorem
of
[Mzk6]
(cf.
Theorem
1.3.4)
—
if
one
assumes
that
αK
∼
arises
geometrically
(i.e.,
from
an
isomorphism
of
ﬁelds
K1

K2
).
In
this
§,
we
would
like
to
investigate
what
one
can
say
in
general
(i.e.,
without
assuming
that
αK
arises
geometrically)
concerning
this
sort
of
commutative
diagram.
In
some
sense,
all
the
key
arguments
that
we
use
here
are
already
present
in
[Mzk4],
except
that
there,
these
arguments
were
applied
to
prove
diﬀerent
theorems.
Thus,
in
the
following
discussion,
we
explain
how
the
same
arguments
may
be
used
to
prove
Theorem
2.7
below.
Let
us
denote
the
type
of
the

curve
(Xi

by

Also,
we
shall
denote
the

by

and
the
unique

That

to

(Xi

if

—
cf.
Lemma
1.3.9).
[Note
that
this
condition
is
group-theoretic,
by
Proposition
1.2.1,

Now
let
us
assume
that
(Xi
)Ki
has
stable
reduction
over
OKi
.
Denote
the
stable
model
of
(Xi
)Ki
over
OKi
by:

Here,
in
the

where

we
mean
by
the

the

in
the
unique
stable

curve
over
OKi
that
extends
the

curve
over

determined

Then,
by

Lemma

it

that

to

we

—
i.e.,
that
the
normalizations
of
all
the
geometric
irreducible
components
of
(Xi
)ki
have
genus
≥
2.
Then
by
[Mzk4],
Proposition
1.3,
it
follows
that
σ
acts
trivially
on
the
set
of
geometric
irreducible
components
of
(Xi
)ki
.
In
particular,
σ
acts
on
each
such
geometric
irreducible
component
individually.
Thus,
by
considering
the
action
of
σ
on
the
torsion
points
of
the
Jacobians
of
each
these
geometric
irreducible
components
of
(Xi
)ki
(cf.
the
proof
of
Lemma
1.3.1),
we
conclude
that
σ
acts
as
the
identity
on
each
of
these
geometric
irreducible
components,
as
desired.
Next,
we
turn
to
assertion
(ii).
For
Πadm
(Xi
)Ki
,
this
follows
(essentially)
from
Proposition
8.4
of
[Mzk4]
(together
with
Lemma
1.3.9,
which
shows
that
αX
preserves
the
pro-p
inertia
groups
associated
to
the
cusps
in
Π(Xi
)Ki
).
Of
course,
in
[Mzk4],
K1
=
K2
and
αK
is
the
identity,
but
in
fact,
the
only
property
of
αK
necessary
for
the
proof
of
[Mzk4],
Proposition
8.4
—
which
is,
in
essence,
a
formal
consequence
of
[Mzk4],
Lemma
8.1
(concerning
unramiﬁed
quotients
of
the
p-adic
Tate
module
of
a
semi-abelian
variety
over
a
p-adic
local
ﬁeld)
—
is
that
αK
preserve
the
inertia
and
wild
inertia
groups
(which
we
know,
by
Proposition
1.2.1,
(ii);
Proposition
1.2.3,
(i),
of
the
present
paper).
Similarly,
the
portion
of
assertion
(ii)
concerning
Πet
(Xi
)Ki
follows
(essentially)
from
[Mzk4],
Proposition
3.2,
at
least
in
the
case
ri
=
0.
That
is
to
say,
even
though
αK
is
not
necessarily
the
identity
in
the
present
discussion,
the
only
properties
of
αK
that
are
necessary
for
the
proof
of
[Mzk4],
Proposition
3.2,
are
Proposition
1.2.3,
(i);
Proposition
1.2.4,
(ii)
(of
the
present
paper).
Finally,
to
treat
the
case
of
arbitrary
ri
>
0,
we
argue
as
follows:
Consider
an
open
normal
subgroup
H
⊆
Πadm
(Xi
)K
.
Then
observe
that
there
exists
an
open
normal
i
adm
adm

subgroup
H

⊆
Πadm
(Xi
)Ki
such
that
the
orders
of
the
ﬁnite
groups
Π(Xi
)Ki
/H,
Π(Xi
)Ki
/H
are
relatively
prime
and
such
that
the
covering
of
(Xi
)ki
determined
by
H

is
sturdy.
Moreover,
[by
the
assumption
of
relative
primeness]
it
follows
easily
that
the
covering
determined
by
H
is
“of
étale
type”
(i.e.,
arises
from
a
quotient
of
Πet
(Xi
)Ki
)
if
and
only
if
it
becomes
a
covering
“of
étale
type”
after
base-change
via
the
covering
determined
by
H

.
Thus,
we
conclude
that
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
(Xi
)ki
is
sturdy.
ABSOLUTE

Now,
let
us
observe
that
since
(Xi
)ki
is
sturdy,
it
admits
admissible
coverings
“of
étale
type”
with
arbitrarily
large
prime-to-p
ramiﬁcation
at
the
cusps.
Thus,
[since
the
condition
that
an
admissible
covering
be
“of
étale
type”
amounts
to
the
condition
that
there
be
no
ramiﬁcation
at
the
nodes
or
at
the
prime
of
OKi
]
we
conclude
that
the
covering
of
(Xi
)ki
determined
by
H
is
of
étale
type
if
and
only
if,
for
every
open
normal
H

⊆
Πadm
(Xi
)K
which
has
ramiﬁcation
index
divisible
by
the
prime-to-p
portion
of
the
i
order
of
the
ﬁnite
group
Πadm
(Xi
)Ki
/H
at
all
of
the
cusps,
it
becomes
a
covering
of
étale
type
after
base-change
by
the
covering
determined
by
H

.
[Indeed,
the
necessity
of
this
condition
is
clear;
the
suﬃciency
of
this
condition
follows
from
the
existence
of
coverings
of
étale
type
with
arbitrarily
large
prime-to-p
ramiﬁcation
at
the
cusps.
Also,
we
note
that
by
Lemma
1.3.9,
this
condition
is
preserved
by
αX
.]
On
the
other
hand,
such
base-changed
coverings
are
[by
construction]
necessarily
unramiﬁed
at
the
cusps.
Thus,
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
this
base-changed
covering
is
of
étale
type
reduces
—
by
Lemma
1.3.9,
which
shows
that
αX
preserves
the
quotient
Π(Xi
)Ki

Π(Yi
)Ki
—
to
the
“ri
=
0”
case,
which
has
already
been
resolved.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii)
in
the
case
ri
>
0.
Lemma
2.3.
(Group-Theoreticity
of
Dual
Semi-Graphs
of
the
Special
Fiber)
The
morphism
αX
induces
an
isomorphism
∼
αX,Γc
:
Γc(X1
)k
→
Γc(X2
)k

between
the
“dual
semi-graphs
with
compact
structure”
(i.e.,
the
usual
dual
graphs
Γ(Xi
)ki
,
together
with
extra
edges
corresponding
to
the
cusps
—
cf.
the
Appendix)
of
the
special
ﬁbers
(Xi
)ki
of
(Xi
)OKi
.
Moreover,
αX,Γc
is
functorial
with
respect
to
passage
to
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
the
(Xi
)Ki
.
Proof.
Indeed,
if
one
forgets
about
the
“compact
structure”,
then
this
is
a
formal
consequence
of
Lemma
1.3.9
[which
shows
that
αX
preserves
the
quotient
Π(Xi
)Ki

Π(Yi
)Ki
];
Lemma
2.2,
(ii),
and
the
theory
[concerning
the
ri
=
0
case]
of
[Mzk4],
§1
–
5,
summarized
in
[Mzk4],
Corollary
5.3.
Even
though
αK
is
not
necessarily
the
identity
in
the
present
discussion,
the
only
properties
of
αK
that
are
necessary
for
the
proof
of
[Mzk4],
Corollary
5.3
are
Proposition
1.2.3,
(i);
Proposition
1.2.4,
(ii)
(of
the
present
paper).
That
is
to
say,
the
point
is
that
the
Frobenius
element
is
preserved,
which
means
that
the
weight
ﬁltrations
on
l-adic
cohomology
(where
l
is
a
prime
distinct
from
p)
are,
as
well.
The
compatibility
with
the
“compact
structure”
follows
from
the
pro-l
(where
l
=
p)
portion
of
Lemma
1.3.9,
together
with
the
easily
veriﬁed
fact
(cf.
the
proof
of
Lemma
1.3.7)
that
the
inertia
group
of
a
cusp
in
Πadm
(Xi
)Ki
is
contained
(up
to
conjugacy)
in
the
decomposition
group
of
a
unique
irreducible
component
of
(Xi
)ki
.
26

Next,
we
would
like
to
show
that
αX
is
necessarily
“of
degree
1”.
This
is
essentially
the
argument
of
[Mzk4],
Lemma
9.1,
but
we
present
this
argument
in
detail
below
since
we
are
working
here
under
the
assumption
that
αK
is
arbitrary.
For
simplicity,
we
assume
until
further
notice
is
given
that:
(∗CSSN
)
ri
=
0
[i.e.,
the
curves
are
compact]
and,
moreover,
the
special
ﬁber
(Xi
)ki
of
(Xi
)OKi
is
singular
and
sturdy
(cf.
[Mzk4],
Deﬁnition
1.1)
—
i.e.,
the
normalizations
of
all
the
geometric
irreducible
components
of
(Xi
)ki
have
genus
≥
2
—
and
has
a
noncontractible
dual
semi-graph
Γc(Xi
)k
—
i.e.,
this
i
semi-graph
is
not
a
tree.
(These
conditions
may
always
be
achieved
by
replacing
(Xi
)Ki
by
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
(Xi
)Ki
—
cf.
[Mzk4],
Lemma
2.9;
[Mzk4],
the
ﬁrst
two
paragraphs
of
the
proof
of
Theorem
9.2.)
We
begin
by
introducing
some
notation.
Write:
def
Vi
=
Δab
Xi
;
def
Hi
=
H1sing
(Γc(Xi
)k
,
Z)
=
H1sing
(Γ(Xi
)ki
,
Z)
i
(where
“H1sing
”
denotes
the
ﬁrst
singular
homology
group).
Thus,
by
considering
the
coverings
of
(Xi
)OKi
induced
by
unramiﬁed
coverings
of
the
graph
Γ(Xi
)ki
,
we
obtain
natural
(group-theoretic!)
“combinatorial
quotients”:

(Hi
)Z
=
Hi

(Ordinary

after
Raynaud)
For
a
“suﬃciently
large
prime
number
l”
(where
“suﬃciently
large”
depends
only
on
p,
gi
),
and
after
possibly
replacing
Ki
by
a
ﬁnite
unramiﬁed
extension
of
Ki
,
there
exists
a

étale
def
covering
(Zi

of
(Xi

of

such
that

Δab
(Zi

/Δ(Xi)Ki
of
the

satisﬁes
the
following:
(i)
We
have
an
exact
sequence:
def
0
→
Vimlt
→
(Vinew

=
Vinew
⊗Z
Zp
→
Vietl
→

—
where
Vietl
is
an
unramiﬁed
GKi
-module,
and
Vimlt
is
the
Cartier
dual
of
an
unramiﬁed
GKi
-module.
(ii)
The
“combinatorial

of
Δab

(arising
from
the

by
unramiﬁed

of
the

semi-graph
of
the
special

of

Here,
the

Δab
(Xi)Ki
→
Δ(Zi

is
the
injection
induced
by
pull-back
via
(Zi
)Ki
→
(Xi
)Ki
and
Poincaré
duality
(or,
alternatively,
by
the
“Verlagerung”).
Proof.
Note
that
since
both
conditions
(i),
(ii)
are
group-theoretic,
they
may
be
realized
simultaneously
for
i
=
1,
2.
Now
to
satisfy
condition
(i),
it
suﬃces
—
cf.,
e.g.,
the
discussion
in
[Mzk4],
§8,
of
“VG
”,
“VGord
”
—
to
choose
the
covering
so
that
the
“new
parts”
of
the
Jacobians
of
the
irreducible
components
of
the
special
ﬁber
of
(Zi
)OKi
are
all
ordinary.
That
this
is
possible
for
l
suﬃciently
large
is
a
consequence
of
a
theorem
of
Raynaud
(as
formulated,
for
instance,
in
[Tama1],
Lemma
1.9).
Then
let
us
observe
that,
so
long
as
we
choose
the
étale
covering
(Zi
)OKi
→
(Xi
)OKi
so
that
it
is
nontrivial
over
every
irreducible
component
of
(Xi
)ki
,
condition
(ii)
is
automatically
satisﬁed:
Indeed,
def
if
we
write
hi
=
rkZ
(Hi
)
—
so
hi
>
0
since
Γc(Xi
)k
is
assumed
to
be
noncontractible
—
i
then
to
assert
that
condition
(ii)
fails
to
hold
—
i.e.,
that
there
are
“no
new
cycles
in
the
dual
graph”
—
is
to
assert
that
we
have
an
equality
of
Euler
characteristics:
gZ,j
+
hi
−
1
=
l

gX
,
j
+
hi
−
1
j

j
(where
the
ﬁrst
(respectively,
second)
sum
is
the
sum
of
the
genera
of
the
irreducible
components
of
the
geometric
special
ﬁber
of
(Zi
)OKi
(respectively,
(Xi
)OKi
)).
But,
since
(gZ,j
−
1)
=
j
l(gX,
j
−
1)
j



(l
−
1)
+
hi
(l
−
1),
hence
that
1
=
(
j
1)
+
hi
we
thus
conclude
that
(l
−
1)
=
j
—
which
is
absurd,
since
both
the
sum
and
hi
are
≥
1.
This
completes
the
proof.
Remark
2.4.1.
The
author
would
like
to
thank
A.
Tamagawa
for
explaining
to
him
the
utility
of
Raynaud’s
theorem
in
this
sort
of
situation.
In
the
following
discussion,
to
keep
the
notation
simple,
we
shall
replace
(Xi
)Ki
by
some
(Zi
)Ki
as
in
Lemma
2.4.
Thus,
Vinew
is
a
GKi
-quotient
module
of
Vi
.
Moreover,
we
have
a
surjection
Vinew

(Hinew
)Z
such
that
the
quotient
(Hi
)Z

(Hinew
)Z
is
deﬁned
over
Z,
i.e.,
arises
from
a
quotient
Hi

Hinew
.
(Indeed,
this
last
assertion
follows
from
the
fact
that
the
quotient
Hi

Hinew
arises
as
the
cokernel
(modulo
torsion)
of
the
morphism
induced
on
ﬁrst
singular

modules
by
a
ﬁnite
(ramiﬁed)

of

—
i.e.,
the

induced
on

by
the
covering
(Zi
)OKi
→
(Xi
)OKi
of
Lemma
2.4.)

(∼

which
is
still
nondegenerate
(over
Q),
since
it
arises
from
an
ample
line
bundle
—
namely,
the
restriction
of
the
polarization
determined
by
the
theta
divisor
on
the
Jacobian
of
(Xi
)Ki
to
the
“new

of
(Xi

.
This
pairing
determines
an
“isogeny”
(i.e.,
a
morphism
which
is
an
isomorphism
over
Q):
(Vinew
)∨
⊗Z
μZ
(K
i
)
⊗Z
Mi∨
→
Vinew
Thus,
if
we
take
the
dual
of
the
surjection
discussed
in
the
preceding
paragraph,
then
we
obtain
an
inclusion
(Hinew

⊗
Mi∨
→
(Vinew
)∨
⊗
μZ
(K

Z
which
(as
one
sees,
for
instance,
by
applying
the
fact
that
μZ
(K
i
)GKi
=
0)
maps
into
the
kernel
of
the
surjection
Vinew

(Hinew
)Z
.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
the
kernel
Ni
of
the
surjection
of
unramiﬁed
GKi
-modules
(i.e.,
Gki
-modules)
Vietl

(Hinew
)Zp
satisﬁes:
H
0
(Gki
,
Ni
⊗
Qp
)
=
H
1
(Gki
,
Ni
⊗
Qp
)
=
0
(Indeed,
Ni
arises
as
a
submodule
of
the
module
of
p-power
torsion
points
of
an
abelian
variety
over
ki
,
so
the
vanishing
of
these
cohomology
groups
follows
from
the
Riemann
Hypothesis
for
abelian
varieties
over
ﬁnite
ﬁelds
(cf.,
e.g.,
[Mumf],
p.
206),
i.e.,
the
fact
that
(some
power
of)
the
Frobenius
element
of
Gki
acts
on
Ni
with
eigenvalues
which
are
algebraic
numbers
with
complex
absolute
values
equal
to
a
nonzero
rational
power
of
p.)
In
particular,
we
conclude
that
the
above
surjection
admits
a
unique
GKi
-equivariant
splitting
(Hinew
)Zp
→
(Vietl
)Qp
.
Similarly,
(by
taking
Cartier

the

also
admits
a
unique

over

Thus,
by
applying
these

we
see
that

Next,
let
us
observe
that
the
kernel
Ni
of
(Vinew
)Z

(Hinew
)Z
is
an
unramiﬁed
representation
of
GKi
(since
it
arises
from
the
module
of
prime-to-p-power
torsion
points
of
a
semi-abelian
variety
over
ki
).
Moreover,
the
injection
of
unramiﬁed
GKi
-modules
⊗
μZ
(K

)
⊗
Mi∨
→
Ni
(Hinew

splits
uniquely
over
Q,
since
(by
the

—
cf.,
e.g.,
[Mumf],

the

acts
on
the
smaller

(respectively,

this

Thus,
just
as
in

we
may
construct
a
prime-to-p-adic
extension
class
(ηi

from
the

(Positive

The

forms
a

Moreover,

diﬀers
from
b,
bi
by
a
factor
in

(i.e.,
a
positive

In
particular,
this
image
determines
a
“Q>0

i.e.,
a
Q-rational
structure
on
(Mi∨

Proof.
Indeed,
assertion
(i),
follows
formally
from
[FC],
Chapter
III,
Corollary
7.3,
and
Theorem
10.1,
(iii)
(by
considering
“new
part”
of
the
Jacobian
of
(Xi
)Ki
equipped
with
the
polarization
induced
by
the
theta
polarization
on
the
Jacobian).
As
for
assertion
(ii),
the
elements
in
question
are
the
unique
elements
that,
on
the
one
hand,
are
rational
and
positive
with
respect
to
the
structures
discussed
in
assertion

(i),
and,
on
the
other
hand,
generate
Mi
as
a
Z-module.
Remark
2.5.1.
Note
that
the
conclusion
of
Lemma
2.5,
(ii),
is
valid
not
just
for
(Xi
)Ki
,
but
for
any
ﬁnite
étale
cover
of
the
original
(Xi
)Ki
,
i.e.,
even
if
this
cover
does
not
arise
as
some
“(Zi
)OKi
”
as
in
Lemma
2.4.
Indeed,
this
follows
from
the
fact
that
the
crucial
“Q>0
-structure”
of
Lemma
2.5,
(i),
is
preserved
by
pull-back
to
such
a
cover,
which
just
multiplies
the
Chern
class
at
issue
in
Lemma
2.5,
(ii),
by
the
degree
of
the
cover
(an
element
of
Q>0
!).
Remark
2.5.2.
In
the
discussion
of
[Mzk4],
§9,
it
was
not
necessary
to
be
as
careful
as
we
were
in
the
discussion
above
in
constructing
the
p-adic
class
(ηi
)Zp
(i.e.,
“μp
”
in
the
notation
of
loc.
cit.).
This
is
because
in
loc.
cit.,
we
were
working
over
a
single
p-adic
base-ﬁeld
“K”.
In
this
more
restricted
context,
the
extension
class
(ηi
)Zp
may
be
extracted
much
more
easily
from
Vi
by
simply
forming
the
quotient
by
the
submodule
of
H
1
(Ki
,
Ker((Vi
)Zp

(Hi
)Zp
))
generated
by
the
elements
which
are
“crystalline”,
or,
more
simply,
of
“geometric
origin”
(i.e.,
arise
from
OK
-rational
points
of
the
formal
group
associated
to
the
p-divisible
group
determined
—
via
“Tate’s
theorem”
(cf.
Theorem
4
of
[Tate])
—
by
the
GKi
-module
Ker((Vi
)Zp

(Hi
)Zp
)).
Unfortunately,
the
author
omitted
a
detailed
discussion
of
this
aspect
of
the
argument
in
the
discussion
of
[Mzk4],
§9.
Remark
2.5.3.
Relative
to
Remark
2.5.2,
we
note
nevertheless
that
even
in
the
discussion
of
[Mzk4],
§9,
it
is
still
necessary
to
work
(at
least
until
one
recovers
the
“Q>0
-structure”
—
cf.
Remark
2.5.1)
with
(Xi
)Ki
such
that
the
dual
graph
of
the
special
ﬁber
(Xi
)ki
is
noncontractible.
This
minor
technical
point
was
omitted
in
the
discussion
of
[Mzk4],
§9.
Next,
let
us
write
(Xilog
)OKi
for
the
log
scheme
obtained
by
equipping
(Xi
)OKi
with
the
log
structure
determined
by
the
monoid
of
regular
functions
∈
O(Xi
)OK
which
i
are
invertible
on
the
open
subscheme
(Xi
)Ki
⊆
(Xi
)OKi
.
Thus,
in
the
terminology
of
[Kato2],
(Xilog
)OKi
is
log
regular.
Also,
let
us
write
(Xilog
)ki
for
the
log
scheme
obtained
by
equipping
(Xi
)ki
with
the
log
structure
determined
by
restricting
the
log
structure
of
(Xilog
)OKi
.
Thus,
the
quotient
Π(Xi
)Ki

Πadm
(Xi
)Ki
determines
a
“universal
admissible
covering”
(Xilog
)ki
→
(Xilog
)ki
ABSOLUTE
ANABELIAN
GEOMETRY
31
of
(Xilog
)ki
.
Now
let
us
choose
a
connected
component
Ii
of
the
ki
-smooth
locus
(i.e.,
the
complement
of
the
nodes)
of
(Xilog
)ki
.
Write
Ii
⊆
(Xi
)ki
for
the
image
of
Ii
in
(Xi
)ki
.
Thus,
Ii
→
Ii
is
a
“tame
universal
covering”
of
Ii
(i.e.,
a
universal
covering
of
the
hyperbolic
curve
Ii
among
those
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
that
are
tamely
ramiﬁed
at
the
“cusps”
of
this
hyperbolic
curve).
In
the
following
discussion,
we
shall
also
assume,
for
simplicity,
that
Ii
is
geometrically
connected
over
ki
(a
condition
that
may
always
be
achieved
by
replacing
Ki
by
a
ﬁnite
unramiﬁed
extension
of
Ki
).
Now
the
Galois
group
ΠIi
of
this
covering
may
also
be
thought
of
as
the
quotient
of
the
decomposition
group
in
Πadm
(Xi
)Ki
of
Ii
by
its
inertia
group.
In
particular,
since
ΠIi
is
formed
by
taking
the
quotient
by
this
inertia
group,
it
follows
that
the
surjection
log
Πadm
(Xi
)K

Gki
induces
a
natural
surjection
i
ΠIi

Gki
whose
kernel
is
the
geometric
(tame)
fundamental
group
π1tame
((Ii
)ki
)
of
Ii
.
Finally,
we
observe
that
it
makes
sense
to
speak
of
I1
and
I2
as
corresponding
via
αX
.
Indeed,
by
Lemma
2.3,
αX
induces
an
isomorphism
between
the
pro-graphs
determined
by
the
(Xilog
)ki
.
Thus,
the
Ii
may
be
said
to
correspond
via
αX
when
the
vertices
that
they
determine
in
these
pro-graphs
correspond.
Moreover,
when
the
Ii
correspond
via
αX
,
it
follows
(by
considering
the
stabilizer
of
the
vertex
determined
by
Ii
)
that
αX
induces
a
bijection
between
the
respective
decomposition
groups
Di
in
Πadm
(Xi
)Ki
of
Ii
,
as
well
as
between
the
respective
inertia
subgroups
of
these
decomposition
groups
Di
(which
may
be
characterized
group-theoretically
as
the
centers
of
the

tame
subgroups
Di
Ker(Πadm
((Ii
)ki
)
is
center-free
—
cf.
Lemma
(Xi
)Ki

Gki
),
since
π1
1.3.10).
Thus,
in
summary,
αX
induces
a
commutative
diagram:

ΠI2

Gk1

We
are
now
ready
(cf.

apply
the

of
[Tama1].
This

and
the

First,
observe
that

we
continue

H

(where

write

Moreover,
since
we
continue
to

under
the
assumption
(∗CSSN
),
it
follows
(cf.
the
discussion
of
“Second
Cohomology

in
the
Appendix)
that
the
natural
“push-forward”
morphism

may
be

using

natural
homomorphisms
π1
((I

)
→
Δet
Xi
[well-deﬁned
up
to
composite
with
an
inner

Thus,
the
desired
vertical
morphisms
of
diagram

may
be
obtained
by
composing
these
“push-forward”

with
the

are

In
particular,
we
thus
see
that
the
vertical
morphisms
of
diagram
(∗2
)
are
grouptheoretic,
i.e.,
(in
other
words)
diagram
(∗2

commutes.
Now
let
us
compose
the
above
two
diagrams
(∗1

(∗2

to
form
a
single
diagram:

Note
that
this

commutes,
since,

[applied
to

horizontal
morphism

the
discussion
immediately
preceding
the
present
Lemma

and
the
discussion
of
“Second

in

[applied
to
the
vertical
morphisms
of

all
of
the

of
this
diagram
are
compatible
with
the
elements
“1”
determined
by
the
ﬁrst
Chern
class
of
a

But
this
implies
that
diagram
(∗1

commutes
(since

already
been
shown
to
be
commutative,

all

The
signiﬁcance
of
Lemma
2.6
from
our
point
of
view
is
the
following:
Lemma
2.6
implies
that
αK
induces
an
isomorphism
∼
log
αGlog
:
Glog
k1
→
Gk2
k
which
satisﬁes
the
hypothesis
of
Proposition
1.2.4,
(iii).
Thus,
we
conclude
from
Proposition
1.2.4,
(iii),
that
αGlog
arises
geometrically.
In
particular,
it
follows
that
we
may
k
apply
[Mzk4],
Theorem
7.2,
to
the
commutative
diagram
∼
Πadm
(X1
)K1
⏐
⏐
→
Πadm
(X2
)K2
⏐
⏐
Glog
k1
→
∼
Glog
k2
(where
we
note
that
Lemma
2.6
also
implies
—
when
translated
into
the
terminology
of
[Mzk4],
§7
—
that
the
“RT-degree”
associated
to
this
commutative
diagram
is
1,
as
is
necessary
for
the
application
of
[Mzk4],
Theorem
7.2).
In
particular,
we
conclude
that
the
above
commutative
diagram
of
fundamental
groups
arises
geometrically
from
a
commutative
diagram:
∼
(X1log
)k1
→
(X2log
)k2
⏐
⏐
⏐
⏐
k1log
∼
→
k2log
Moreover,
the
isomorphism
exhibited
in
the
upper
horizontal
arrow
of
this
commutative
diagram
is
easily
seen
to
be
functorial
with
respect
to
arbitrary
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
the
(Xi
)Ki
(i.e.,
not
just
coverings
that
arise
from
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
the
(Xi
)OKi
).
Indeed,
this
functoriality
follows
formally
from
the
uniqueness
assertion
in
Proposition
1.2.4,
(iii),
and
the
fact
that
dominant
(i.e.,
not
just
ﬁnite
étale)
morphisms
between
proper
hyperbolic
curves
in
characteristic
p
may
be
distinguished
by
considering
the
morphisms
that
they
induce
between
the
respective
Jacobians,
hence,
in
particular,
by
the
morphisms
that
they
induce
between
the
l-power
torsion
points
(where
l
=
p)
of
the
respective
Jacobians.
[Note
also
that
the
morphisms
between
log
structures
at
the
nodes
are
uniquely
determined
by
the
morphisms
between
the
various
normal
bundles
on

Theorem
2.7.
(Group-Theoretic
Reconstruction
of
the
Logarithmic
Special
Fiber
of
a
p-adic
Hyperbolic
Curve)
Let
p
be
a
prime
number.
For
i
=
1,
2,
let
Ki
be
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
,
and
(Xi
)Ki
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
Ki
whose
associated
pointed
stable
curve
has
stable
reduction
over
OKi
.
Denote
the
resulting
“stable
model”
of
(Xi
)Ki
over
OKi
by
(Xi
)OKi
.
Assume
that
we
have
chosen
basepoints
of
the
(Xi
)Ki
(which
thus
induce
basepoints
of
the
Ki
).
Then
every
isomorphism
of
proﬁnite
groups
∼
Π(X1
)K1
→
Π(X2
)K2
induces
commutative
diagrams:

Moreover,
the

on

lies
over
the

on

(which
is
as
in

1.2.4,

Here,
we
equip
Spec(OKi
)
(respectively,
Spec(ki
);
(Xi
)OKi
;
(Xi
)ki
)
with
the
log
structure
determined
by
the
closed
point
(respectively,
determined
by
restricting
the
log
structure
on
Spec(OKi
);
determined
by
the
monoid
of
functions
invertible
on
the
open
subscheme
(Xi
)Ki
;
determined
by
restricting
log
the
log
structure
on
(Xi
)OKi
)
and
denote
the
resulting
log
scheme
by
OK
(respectively,
i
log

log
ki
;
(Xi

;
(Xi

);
the
vertical
morphisms
in
the
above
commutative
diagrams
of
log
schemes
are
the
universal
coverings
induced
by
the
various
basepoints
chosen.
Proof.
First,
note
that
the
additional
assumptions
that
were
used
in
the
course
of
the
above
discussion
—
e.g.,
“(∗CSSN
)”;
the
assumption
that
(Xi
)OKi
arise
as
some
“(Zi
)OKi
”
as
in
Lemma
2.4
—
were
applied
only
to
show
that
the
hypotheses
of
Proposition
1.2.4,
(iii)
(and
[Mzk4],
Theorem
7.2)
are
satisﬁed.
Moreover,
we
observe
that
although
[Mzk4],
Theorem
7.2,
is
only
stated
in
the
proper
singular
case,
it
extends
immediately
to
the
aﬃne
singular,
as
well
as
aﬃne
nonsingular,
cases.
Thus,
(cf.
Remark
2.5.1;
the
discussion
surrounding
“(∗CSSN
)”)
one
concludes
that
—
except
when
(Xi
)Ki
is
proper,
with
good
reduction
—
one
may
reconstruct
the
logarithmic
special
ﬁber
in
a
functorial
fashion
(i.e.,
with
respect
to
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
the
(Xi
)Ki
),
as
desired.
In
the
case
that
(Xi
)Ki
is
proper,
but
has
good
reduction
over
OKi
,
we
may
still
reconstruct
its
logarithmic
special
ﬁber
(despite
the
fact
that
[Tama1],
Theorem
4.3,
36
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
is
only
stated
in
[Tama1]
for
aﬃne
hyperbolic
curves!)
by
arguing
as
follows:
First
of
all,
we
observe
that
in
the
case
of
good
reduction,
the
log
structure
of
the
special
ﬁber
of
the
curve
is
obtained
by
simply
pulling
back
the
log
structure
of
kilog
.
Thus,
it
suﬃces
to
construct
the
(non-logarithmic,
scheme-theoretic)
special
ﬁber.
Next,
we
observe
that
(after
possibly
enlarging
Ki
)
there
exist
—
cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk4],
the
ﬁrst
two
paragraphs
of
the
proof
of
Theorem
9.2
—
corresponding
ﬁnite
Galois
étale
coverings
(Zi
)Ki
→
(Xi
)Ki
(for
i
=
1,
2),
where
(Zi
)Ki
is
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
Ki
with
bad
stable
reduction
(Zi
)OKi
over
OKi
.
Thus,
by
applying
Theorem
2.7
to
(Zi
)Ki
allows
us
to
reconstruct
the
logarithmic
special
ﬁber
(Zilog
)ki
,
together
with
the
action
of
the
def
Galois
group
Gi
=
Gal((Zi
)Ki
/(Xi
)Ki
).
Note
that
irreducible
components
of
(Zi
)ki
that
dominate
(Xi
)ki
may
be
distinguished
(group-theoretically!)
by
the
fact
that
their
geometric
fundamental
groups
map
surjectively
onto
open
subgroups
of
the
geometric
fundamental
group
of
(Xi
)ki
.
Let
us
choose
corresponding
(closed,
proper)
irreducible
components
Ci
⊆
(Zi
)ki
that
dominate
(hence
surject
onto)
(Xi
)ki
.
Denote
the
decomposition
(respectively,
inertia)
group
associated
to
Ci
by
Di
⊆
Gi
(respectively,
Ii
⊆
Di
⊆
Gi
).
Thus,
Di
/Ii
acts
faithfully
on
Ci
,
and
the
order
|Ii
|
of
Ii
is
a
power
of
p,
equal
to
the
degree
of
inseparability
of
the
function
ﬁeld
of
Ci
over
the
function
ﬁeld
of
(Xi
)ki
.
Then
we
may
reconstruct
(Xi
)ki
as
a
ﬁnite
ﬂat
quotient
of
Ci
by
considering
the
subsheaf
|I
|
(OCii
)Di
⊆
OCi
|I
|
(i.e.,
the
Di
-invariants
of
the
subalgebra
OCii
⊆
OCi
,
where
we
use
that
|Ii
|
is
a
power
of
p).
By
applying
the
functoriality
with
respect
to
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
(Xi
)Ki
observed
in
the
discussion
immediately
preceding
the
statement
of
Theorem
2.7,
we
conclude
that
this
construction
of
(Xi
)ki
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
(Zi
)Ki
,
Ci
,
and
itself
functorial
with
respect
to
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
(Xi
)Ki
.
This
completes
our
reconstruction
of
the
logarithmic
special
ﬁbers
of
the
(Xi
)Ki
,
in
a
fashion
that
is
functorial
with
respect
to
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
the
(Xi
)Ki
.
Thus,
we
conclude,
in
particular,
(from
this
functoriality,
applied
to
covering
transformations;
the
slimness
of
Lemma
2.2,
(i))
that
the
morphism
induced
on
admissible
fundamental
groups
by
the
isomorphism
constructed
between
logarithmic
special
ﬁbers
coincides
with
the
original
given
morphism
between
admissible
fundamental
groups.
This
completes
the
proof
of
Theorem
2.7.
Remark
2.7.1.
representation
Given
data
as
in
Theorem
2.7,
one
may
consider
the
outer
Galois
GKi
→
Out(ΔXi
)
ABSOLUTE
ANABELIAN
GEOMETRY
37
which
is
known
to
be
injective
if
ri
>
0
(cf.
Theorem
1.3.6).
Thus,
at
least
in
the
case
ri
>
0,
it
is
natural
to
ask:
What
is
the
commensurator
of
Im(GKi
)
in
Out(ΔXi
)?
Although
Theorem
2.7
does
not
give
a
complete
explicit
answer
to
this
question,
it
tells
us
that,
at
any
rate,
elements
of
this
commensurator
(which
deﬁne
isomorphisms
of
the
sort
that
are
treated
in
Theorem
2.7)
preserve
the
logarithmic
special
ﬁber.
In
particular,
(although
one
does
not
know
whether
or
not
elements
of
this
commensurator
induce
“self-isogenies”
of
Ki
,
i.e.,
are
“geometric”)
one
obtains
that
elements
of
this
commensurator
do
induce
“self-isogenies”
of
kilog
.
[Here,
by
a
“self-isogeny
of
an
object”,
we
mean
an
isomorphism
between
two
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
the
object.]
Moreover,
since
it
follows
from
Theorem
A
of
[Mzk6]
(cf.
Theorem
1.3.4,
Remark
1.3.6.2)
that
the
centralizer
of
Im(GKi
)
in
Out(ΔXi
)
consists
precisely
of
those
(ﬁnitely
many)
automorphisms
that
arise
geometrically
(i.e.,
from
automorphisms
of
(Xi
)Ki
),
it
follows
that
a
“self-isogeny”
of
GKi
induced
by
an
element
of
this
commensurator
corresponds
to
(up
to
ﬁnitely
many
well-understood
possibilities)
an
essentially
unique
element
of
this
commensurator.
This
motivates
the
point
of
view
that:
The
“self-isogenies”
of
GKi
deﬁned
by
elements
of
this
commensurator
—
which
we
shall
refer
to
as
quasi-conformal
self-isogenies
of
GKi
—
are
natural
objects
to
study
in
their
own
right.
The
reason
for
the
choice
of
the
terminology
“quasi-conformal”
is
that
those
selfisogenies
that
are
“of
geometric
origin”
—
i.e.,
“conformal”
—
are
(by
the
main
theorem
of
[Mzk5])
precisely
those
which
preserve
the
higher
ramiﬁcation
ﬁltration,
which
is
closely
related
to
the
“canonical
p-adic
metric”
on
the
local
ﬁeld
in
question.
Thus,
quasi-conformal
self-isogenies
do
not
preserve
the
“metric
(or
conformal)
structure”
but
do
preserve
the
“logarithmic
special
ﬁber”
which
one
may
think
of
as
a
sort
of
p-adic
analogue
of
the
“topological
type”
of
the
objects
in
question.
Remark
2.7.2.
Note
that
isomorphisms
∼
k1log
→
k2log
∼
(such
as
those
arising
from
“quasi-conformal
isomorphisms”
GK1
→
GK2
as
in
Theorem
2.7)
need
not
be
“geometric”
from
the
point
of
view
of
characteristic
zero
(i.e.,
induced
∼
by
an
isomorphism
of
ﬁelds
K1
→
K2
).
For
instance,
such
an
isomorphism
might
take
the
section
of
the
log
structure
corresponding
to
p
to
some
multiple
of
this
section
by
a
root
of
unity
(a
situation
which
could
never
occur
if
the
isomorphism
arose
from
an
∼
isomorphism
K1
→
K2
).
Whether
or
not,
however,
this
sort
of
phenomenon
actually
38
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
takes
place
in
the
case
of
“quasi-conformal
isomorphisms”
as
in
Theorem
2.7
is
not
clear
to
the
author
at
the
time
of
writing.
Remark
2.7.3.
The
theory
of
the
present
§
prompts
the
question:
∼
Do
isomorphisms
Π(X1
)K1
→
Π(X2
)K2
as
in
Theorem
2.7
only
preserve
the
logarithmic
special
ﬁber
or
do
they
preserve
other
information
as
well
concerning
the
liftings
(Xi
)Ki
of
the
respective
logarithmic
special
ﬁbers?
Although
the
author
is
unable
to
give
a
complete
answer
to
this
question
at
the
time
of
writing,
it
does
appear
that
when
the
lifting
in
question
is
in
some
sense
“canonical”,
then
this
canonicality
is
preserved
by
isomorphisms
as
in
Theorem
2.7.
In
a
future
paper,
we
hope
to
discuss
this
sort
of
phenomenon
—
which
may
be
observed,
for
instance,
in
the
following
cases:
(1)
Serre-Tate
canonical
liftings;
(2)
“arithmetic
hyperbolic
curves”,
i.e.,
hyperbolic
curves
isogenous
to
a
Shimura
curve
[that
is
to
say,
curves
which
admit
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
which
is
isomorphic
to
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
some
Shimura
curve];
(3)
canonical
liftings
in
the
sense
of
“p-adic
Teichmüller
theory”
(cf.
[Mzk1],
[Mzk2])
—
in
more
detail.
Perhaps
this
phenomenon
should
be
regarded
as
a
natural
extension
of
the
phenomenon
of
preservation
of
the
logarithmic
ﬁber
in
the
sense
that
canonical
liftings
are,
in
some
sense,
liftings
that
are
“deﬁned
over
F1
”
—
i.e.,
a
hypothetical
(but,
of
course,
ﬁctional!)
absolute
ﬁeld
of
constants
sitting

We

the

[i.e.,
the

of
the

V

as
the

of

to
the

and
to
the
cardinality
of
the

of

as
the

of
e.
A
graph
Γ
is
a
semi-graph
Γ
for
which
every
e
∈
E
has
verticial
cardinality
precisely
2.
We
will
say
that
a
graph
or
semigraph
is
ﬁnite
if
its
sets
of
vertices
and
edges
are
ﬁnite.
We
shall
refer
to
an
element
b

e
as
a

the

Let
Γ

If

2
whose

ζe
consists
of
two

v1

V,
then
we
shall
say
that
e
joins
v1
to

If
v
is
any
vertex
in
the
image
of
ζe
,
then
we
shall
say
that
e
meets
or
abuts
to
v.
Thus,
an
edge
of
a

always
abuts
to
at
least
one
vertex,
while
an
edge
of
a
semi-graph
may
abut
to
no
vertices
at
all.
By
thinking
of
vertices
as
points
and
edges
as
line
segments
that
join
points
to
points
or
are
“open”
at
one
or
both
ends,
we
may
think
of
semi-graphs
as
deﬁning
topological
spaces.
Thus,
it
makes
sense
to
speak
of
a
semi-graph
as
being
contractible
(in
the
sense
of
algebraic
topology).
Such
a
semi-graph
will
be
referred
to
as
a
tree.
Finally,
a
morphism
between
semi-graphs
Γ
=
{V,
E,
ζ}
→
Γ
=
{V

,
E

,
ζ

}
is
a
collection
of
maps
V
→
V

;
E
→
E

;
and
for
each
e
∈
E
mapping
to
e
,
an
injection
e
→
e
—
all
of
which
are
compatible
with
the
verticial
restrictions
of
the
respective
coincidence
maps.
Thus,
here,
we
allow
an
edge
that
abuts
to
no
(respectively,
precisely
one)
vertex
to
map
to
an
edge
that
abuts
to
any
number
≥
0
(respectively,
≥
1)
of
vertices.
Semi-Graphs
of
Proﬁnite
Groups:
We
shall
refer
to
the
following
data
G:
(i)
a
ﬁnite
semi-graph
Γ;
(ii)
for
each
vertex
v
of
Γ,
a
proﬁnite
group
Gv
;
(iii)
for
each
edge
e
of
Γ,
a
proﬁnite
group
Ge
,
together
with,
for
each
branch
b
∈
e
mapping
to
a
vertex
v
via
ζe
,
a
continuous
homomorphism
b∗
:
Ge
→
Gv
as
a
semi-graph
of
proﬁnite
groups.
When
Γ
is
a
graph,
we
shall
refer
to
this
data
G
as
a
graph
of
proﬁnite
groups.
Suppose
that
we
are
given
a
semi-graph
of
proﬁnite
groups
G.
Then
to
G,
one
may
associate
(in
a
natural,
functorial
fashion)
a
proﬁnite
group
ΠG
—
namely,
the
40
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
proﬁnite
analogue
of
the
well-known
construction
of
the
fundamental
group
associated
to
a
(semi-)graph
of
groups
(cf.
[Serre1],
I,
§5.1).
One
way
to
describe
this
proﬁnite
analogue
is
via
Galois
categories
(cf.,
e.g.,
[SGA1]
for
an
exposition
of
the
theory
of
Galois
categories)
as
follows:
If
H
is
an
arbitrary
proﬁnite
group,
then
let
us
write
B(H)
for
the
category
of
ﬁnite
sets
with
continuous
H-action.
Then
H
may
be
recovered
as
the
“fundamental
group”
of
the
Galois
category
B(H).
Also,
we
note
that
any
continuous
homomorphism
of
proﬁnite
groups
H
→
H

determines
a
natural
functor
B(H

)
→
B(H)
[in
the
reverse
direction].
In
particular,
the
homomorphisms
b∗
determine
functors:
def
def
b∗
:
Cv
=
B(Gv
)
→
Ce
=
B(Ge
)
At
any
rate,
to
deﬁne
ΠG
,
it
suﬃces
to
deﬁne
a
Galois
category
CG
[which
we
would
like
to
think
of
as
“B(ΠG
)”].
We
deﬁne
CG
to
be
the
category
of
collections
of
data:
{Sv
;
αe
}
Here,
“v”
(respectively,
“e”)
ranges
over
the
vertices
(respectively,
edges
of
verticial
cardinality
2)
of
Γ;
Sv
is
an
object
of
Cv
;
and
αe
:
b∗1
(Sv1
)
∼
=
b∗2
(Sv2
)
(where
e
=
{b1
,
b2
};
def
vi
=
ζe
(bi
),
for
i
=
1,
2)
is
an
isomorphism
in
Ce
.
Morphisms
between
such
collections
of
data
are
deﬁned
in
the
evident
way.
One
then
veriﬁes
easily
that
this
category
CG
is
indeed
a
Galois
category,
as
desired.
Pointed
Stable
Curves:
Let
k
be
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld.
Let
g,
r
≥
0
be
integers
such
that
2g−2+r
>
0.
Let
(X
→
Spec(k),
D
⊆
X)
be
an
r-pointed
stable
curve
of
genus
g
(where
D
⊆
X
is
the
divisor
of
marked
points)
over
k,
and
set:
def
X
=
X\D
Also,
let
us
write
X

⊆
X
for
the
complement
of
the
nodes
in
X.
Next,
we
deﬁne
the
dual
graph
ΓX
of
X.
The
set
of
vertices
of
ΓX
is
the
set
of
irreducible
components
of
X.
To
avoid
confusion,
we
shall
write
Xv
for
the
irreducible
component
corresponding
to
a
vertex
v.
The
set
of
edges
of
ΓX
is
the
set
of
nodes
of
X.
To
avoid
confusion,
we
shall
write
νe
for
the
node
corresponding
to
an
edge
e.
The
node
νe
has
two
branches
νe
[1]
and
νe
[2],
each
of
which
lies
on
some
well-deﬁned
irreducible
component
of
X.
We
take
ABSOLUTE
ANABELIAN
GEOMETRY
41
def
e
=
{νe
[1],
νe
[2]}
[so
e
is
of
verticial
cardinality
2],
and
let
ζe
be
the
map
that
sends
νe
[i]
to
the
irreducible
component
on
which
the
branch
νe
[i]
lies.

def
Let
us
write
Xv
=
Xv
X

⊆
X,
and
(for
i
=
1,
2)
Xν
e
[i]
for
the
scheme-theoretic
intersection
with
X

of
the
completion
of
the
branch
νe
[i]
at
the
node
νe
.
Thus,
Xν
e
[i]
is
noncanonically
isomorphic
to
Spec(k[[t]][t−1
])
(where
t
is
an
indeterminate).
In
the
following
discussion,
we
would
like
to
ﬁx
(k-linear)
isomorphisms:
Xν
e
[1]
∼
=
Xν
e
[2]
via
which
we
shall
identify
Xν
e
[1]
with
Xν
e
[2]
and
denote
the
resulting
object
by
Xe
.
In
def
particular,
we
have
natural
morphisms
Xe
→
Xv
1
,
Xe
→
Xv
2
(where
vi
=
ζe
(νe
[i]),
for
i
=
1,
2).
One
veriﬁes
immediately
that
the
induced
morphism
on
tame
algebraic
fundamental
groups
[i.e.,
corresponding
to
coverings
which
are
tamely
ramiﬁed
at
the
nodes
and
marked
points]
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
isomorphism.
Thus,
the
dual
graph
ΓX
,
together
with
the
result
of
applying
“π1tame
(−)”
[more
precisely:
the
tame
algebraic
fundamental
group
functor,
together
with
choices
of
basepoints
for
the
various
Xv
,
Xe
,
and
choices
of
paths
to
relate
these
basepoints
via
the
natural
morphisms
Xe
→
Xv
i
discussed
above]
to
the
data
{Xv
;
Xe
;
Xe
→
Xv
}
determines
a
graph
of
proﬁnite
groups
GX
associated
to
the
stable
curve
X.
When
considering
the
case
of
a
curve
with
marked
points
(i.e.,
r
>
0),
it
is
useful
to
consider
the
following
slightly
modiﬁed
“data
with
compact
structure”:
Let
us
denote
by
ΓcX
the
semi-graph
obtained
from
ΓX
by
appending
to
ΓX
,
for
each
marked
point
x
∈
X,
the
following:
def
an
edge
ex
=
{x},
where
x
∈
ex
is
sent
by
ζex
to
the
vertex
vx
corresponding
to
the
irreducible
component
of
X
that
contains
x.
We
shall
refer
to
the
new
edges
“ex
”
that
were
added
to
ΓX
to
form
ΓcX
as
the
marked
edges
of
ΓcX
and
to
ΓcX
itself
as
the
dual
graph
with
compact
structure
associated
to
X.
If,
moreover,
we
associate
to
ex
the
scheme
Xx
(which
is
noncanonically
isomorphic
to
Spec(k[[t]][t−1
]))
obtained
by
removing
x
from
the
completion
of
X
at
x,
and
apply
“π1tame
(−)”
to
the
natural
morphism
Xx
→
Xv
x
,
then
we
obtain
a
natural
semi-graph
c
of
proﬁnite
groups
GX
with
underlying
semi-graph
ΓcX
.
Moreover,
one
checks
easily
that
when
k
is
of
characteristic
0,
the
proﬁnite
group
associated
(as
described
above)
to
GX
c

g,r
”,
i.e.,
the
proﬁnite
completion
of
the
fundamental
group
of
or
GX
is
isomorphic
to
“Π
a
Riemann
surface
of
genus
g
with
r
points
removed.
In
fact,
if
we
take
k
=
C,
and
we
think
of
the
Xv
as
Riemann
surfaces
and
of
the

Xe
,
Xx
as
“copies
of
the
circle
S1”,
then
we
see
that
this
construction
corresponds
quite
geometrically
to
gluing
Riemann
surfaces
with
boundary
along
copies
of
the
circle.
42
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
Finally,
let
us
observe
the
following
(valid
for
k
of
arbitrary
characteristic):
The
c
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
admissible
fundaproﬁnite
group
associated
to
GX
or
GX
mental
group
Πadm
X
of
(X,
D)
(cf.
[Mzk4],
§2,
8;
[Mzk3],
§3).
Moreover,
if
we
deﬁne
semi-graphs
of
groups
c,et
et
GX
,
GX
by
taking
the
proﬁnite
group
at
a
vertex
v
to
be
the
tame
fundamental
group
of
Xv
[i.e.,
instead
of
Xv
]
and
the
proﬁnite
group
at
all
of
the
edges
to
be
trivial,
then
the
resulting
proﬁnite
group
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
fundamental
group
Πet
X
associated
to
the
Galois
category
of
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
X
which
are
tamely
ramiﬁed
at
the
cusps.
In
particular,
we
have
a
natural
surjection
Πadm

Πet
X
X.
Second
Cohomology
Groups:
We
continue
with
the
notation
of
the
above
discussion.
Let
l
be
a
prime
number
distinct
from
the
characteristic
of
k.
In
the
following
discussion,
we
shall
use
the
notation
“H
j
(−)”
(respectively,
“Hcj
(−)”)
to
denote
the
j-th
étale
cohomology
module
(respectively,
j-th
étale
cohomology
module
with
compact
supports
—
cf.
[Milne],
Chapter
III,
Proposition
1.29;
Remark
1.30)
with
coeﬃcients
in
Zl
.
If
v
is
a
vertex
of
ΓX
,
write
X
v
for
the
normalization
of
the
corresponding
irreducible
component
of
X,
so
Xv
=
X

×X
X
v
.
Then
we
have
a
natural
“push-forward”
isomorphism
∼
Hc2
(Xv
)
→
H
2
(X
v
)
between
free
Zl
-modules
of
rank
1.
Moreover,
the
natural
morphisms
X
v
→
X
(as
v
ranges
over
the
vertices
of
ΓX
)
determine
natural
restriction
morphisms
whose
direct
sum
is
easily
veriﬁed
to
be
an
isomorphism:

∼
H
2
(X)
→
H
2
(X
v
)
v
On
the
other
hand,
the
composite
of
the
natural
“push-forward”
morphism
Hc2
(Xv
)
→
H
2
(X)
with
a
restriction
morphism
H
2
(X)
→
H
2
(X
w
),
where
w
=
v,
is
easily
veriﬁed
to
be
zero.
[Indeed,
this
follows
by
considering
the
Chern
class
of
the
line
bundle
on
X
associated
to
a
closed
point
of
Xv
:
This
Chern
class
is
the
image
of
a
generator
of
Hc2
(Xv
)
and,
moreover,
vanishes
upon
restriction
to
X
w
since
the
restriction
to
X
w
of
this
line
bundle
is
clearly
trivial.]
In
particular,
we
conclude
that
the
direct
sum
of
the
natural
“push-forward”
morphisms
Hc2
(Xv
)
→
H
2
(X)
yields
an
isomorphism

∼
Hc2
(Xv
)
→
H
2
(X)
v
ABSOLUTE
ANABELIAN

43
∼
which,
if
we
identify
Hc2
(Xv
),
H
2
(X
v
)
via
the
isomorphism
Hc2
(Xv
)
→
H
2
(X
v
),
is
∼

2
inverse
to
the
isomorphism
H
2
(X)
→
v
H
(X
v
).
Put
another
way,
if
we
identify
the
cohomology
modules
Hc2
(Xv
),
H
2
(X
v
)
via
∼
the
isomorphism
Hc2
(Xv
)
→
H
2
(X
v
),
then
the
natural
“push-forward”
morphism
Hc2
(Xv
)
→
H
2
(X)
may
be
recovered
as
the
composite
H
2
(X
v
)
→

∼
H
2
(X
v
)
→
H
2
(X)
v
of
the
natural
inclusion
of
a
direct
summand
with
the
inverse
of
the
isomorphism
∼

2
H
2
(X)
→
v
H
(X
v
)
determined
by
the
restriction
morphisms.
Finally,
let
us
observe
that
if
X
is
sturdy
(cf.
[Mzk4],
Deﬁnition
1.1)
—
i.e.,
every
X
v
has
genus
≥
2
—
then
the
natural
morphisms
from
proﬁnite
group
cohomology
to
étale
cohomology
give
rise
to
a
commutative
diagram
H

(X

)
in
which
the
horizontal
morphisms
are
isomorphisms
[since
arbitrary
étale
cohomology
classes
with
ﬁnite
l-power
torsion
coeﬃcients
vanish
upon
restriction
to
some
