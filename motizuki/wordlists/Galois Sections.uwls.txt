Introduction
In
this
paper,
we
continue
our
study
of
the
absolute
anabelian
geometry
of
hyperbolic
curves
over
p-adic
local
ﬁelds
[i.e.,
ﬁnite
extensions
of
the
ﬁeld
of
p-adic
numbers,
for
some
prime
number
p],
begun
in
[Mzk2],
[Mzk3].
In
[Mzk3],
Theorem
2.4,
it
was
shown,
as
a
consequence
of
the
main
theorem
of
[Mzk1],
that
certain
categories
of
ﬁnite
étale
correspondences
associated
to
a
hyperbolic
curve
XK
over
a
p-adic
local
ﬁeld
K
may
be
recovered
from
the
proﬁnite
group
structure
of
the
étale
fundamental
group
ΠXK
of
XK
.
In
the
present
paper,
we
generalize
this
result
to
show
[again
as
a
consequence
of
the
main
theorem
of
[Mzk1]]
that
certain
categories
of
arbitrary
dominant
[i.e.,
not
necessarily
ﬁnite
étale]
correspondences
associated
to
XK
may
be
recovered
from
the
proﬁnite
group
structure
of
ΠXK
[cf.
Theorem
2.3].
We
then
apply
this
result
to
study
the
extent
to
which
the
decomposition
groups
associated
to
closed
points
of
XK
may
be
recovered
from
the
proﬁnite
group
structure
of
ΠXK
[cf.
Corollaries
2.5,
2.6,
3.2].
One
result
that
is
representative
of
these
techniques
is
the
following
special
case
of
Corollary
3.2:
Theorem
A.
Let
K
be
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
;
XK
a
hyperbolic
curve
of
genus
zero
over
K
which
is,
in
fact,
deﬁned
over
a
number
ﬁeld.
Write
ΠXK
for
the
étale
fundamental
group
of
XK
.
Then
any
automorphism
of
the
proﬁnite
group
ΠXK
preserves
the
decomposition
groups
⊆
ΠXK
associated
to
the
closed
points
of
XK
.
This
result
may
be
regarded
as
a
sort
of
[very]
weak
version
of
the
“Section
Conjecture”
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk1],
§19
for
more
on
the
“Section
Conjecture”].
Finally,
in
§4,
we
show,
in
the
notation
of
Theorem
A,
that
various
canonical
auxiliary
structures
associated
to
the
decomposition
groups
of
cusps
of
XK
are
also
preserved
by
arbitrary
automorphisms
of
ΠXK
[cf.
Corollary
4.11].

Numbers:
If
p
is
a
prime
number,
then
we
shall
denote
by
Qp
the
ﬁeld
of
p-adic
numbers,
i.e.,
the
completion
of
the
ﬁeld
of
rational
numbers
Q
with
respect
to
the
p-adic
valuation
of
Q.
We
shall
refer
to
a
ﬁeld
which
is
isomorphic
to
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
for
some
p
as
a
local
ﬁeld.
[In
particular,
in
this
paper,
all
“local
ﬁelds”
are
nonarchimedean.]
A

deﬁned
to

a

of
the

Q.
Topological
Groups:
Let
G
be
a
Hausdorﬀ
topological
group,
and
H
⊆
G
a
closed
subgroup.
Let
us
write
def
ZG
(H)

g
·
h

g,
∀

H

g

for
the

def

H
has
ﬁnite
index
in
H,
g
·
H

g

}
for
the
commensurator
of
H
in
G.
Note
that:
(i)
ZG
(H),
NG
(H)
and
CG
(H)
are
subgroups
of
G;
(ii)
we
have
inclusions
H,
ZG
(H)
⊆
NG
(H)
⊆
CG
(H)
and
(iii)
H
is
normal
in
NG
(H).
If
H
=
CG
(H),
then
we
shall
say
that
H
is
commensurably
terminal
in
G.
Note
that
ZG
(H),
NG
(H)
are
always
closed
in
G,
while
CG
(H)
is
not
necessarily
closed
in
G.
If
G1
,
G2
are
Hausdorﬀ
topological
groups,
then
an
outer
homomorphism
G1

is
deﬁned
to
be
an

class
of
continuous

G1

two

they

We

the

of

of
C
by
Ob(C);
Arr(C)
respectively.
If
A

all

are

the

A

Let

Then
we
recall
that
the

Curves:
Suppose
that
g
≥
0
is
an
integer.
Then
if
S
is
a
scheme,
a
family
of
curves
of
genus
g
X→S
is
deﬁned
to
be
a
smooth,

morphism
of

whose

are
curves
of
genus
g.
Suppose
that
g,
r
≥
0
are
integers
such
that
2g
−
2
+
r
>
0.
We
shall
denote
the
moduli
stack
of
r-pointed
stable
curves
of
genus
g
(where
we
assume
the
points
to
be
unordered)
by
Mg,r
[cf.
[DM],
[Knud]
for
an
exposition
of
the
theory
of
such
curves;
strictly
speaking,
[Knud]
treats
the
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
Mg,r
determined
by
ordering
the
marked
points].
The
open
substack
Mg,r
⊆
Mg,r
of
smooth
curves
will
be
referred
to
as
the
moduli
stack
of
smooth
r-pointed
stable
curves
of
genus
g
or,
alternatively,
as
the
moduli
stack
of
hyperbolic
curves
of
type
(g,
r).
The
divisor
at
inﬁnity
Mg,r
\Mg,r
of
Mg,r
determines
a
log
structure
on
Mg,r
;
denote
the
log
resulting
log
stack
by
Mg,r
.
A
family
of
hyperbolic
curves
of
type
(g,
r)
X→S
is
deﬁned
to
be
a
morphism
which
factors
X
→
Y
→
S
as
the
composite
of
an
open
immersion
X

Y
onto
the
complement
Y
\D
of
a
relative
divisor
D
⊆
Y
4
SHINICHI

which
is
ﬁnite
étale
over
S
of
relative
degree
r,
and
a
family
Y
→
S
of
curves
of
genus
g.
One
checks
easily
that,
if
S
is
normal,
then
the
pair
(Y,
D)
is
unique
up
to
canonical
isomorphism.
(Indeed,
when
S
is
the
spectrum
of
a
ﬁeld,
this
fact
is
well-known
from
the
elementary
theory
of
algebraic
curves.
Next,
we
consider
an
arbitrary
connected
normal
S
on
which
a
prime
l
is
invertible
(which,
by
Zariski
localization,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality).
Denote
by
S

→
S
the
ﬁnite
étale
covering
parametrizing
orderings
of
the
marked
points
and
trivializations
of
the
l-torsion
points
of
the
Jacobian
of
Y
.
Note
that
S

→
S
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
(Y,
D),
since
(by
the
normality
of
S),
S

may
be
constructed
as
the
normalization
of
S
in
the
function
ﬁeld
of
S

(which
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
(Y,
D)
since
the
restriction
of
(Y,
D)
to
the
generic
point
of
S
has
already
been
shown
to
be
unique).
Thus,
the
uniqueness
of
(Y,
D)
follows
by
considering
the
classifying
morphism
(associated
to
(Y,
D))
from
S

to
the
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
(Mg,r
)Z[

]
parametrizing
orderings
of
the

of

[since
this
covering
is
well-known
to
be
a
scheme,
for
l
suﬃciently
large].)
We
shall
refer
to
Y

D;
D;
D)

the
compactiﬁcation

divisor
at
inﬁnity;

A

that
the

of
S
is
a
family
of
hyperbolic
curves
of
type
(g,
r)
for
some
integers
(g,
r)
as
above.
If
the
divisor
of
cusps
of
a
family
of
hyperbolic
curves
X
→
S
forms
a
split
ﬁnite
étale
covering
over
S,
then
we
shall
say
that
this

is
cuspidally

A

X

(0,

(respectively,
(1,

will
be
referred
to
as
a
tripod
(respectively,
once-punctured
elliptic
curve).
If
XK
(respectively,
YL
)
is
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
a
ﬁeld
K
(respectively,
L),
then
we
shall
say
that

open
subgroup
of

]
which
arises
from
an
embedding
of

L
→
K.
Proof.
Recall
that
given
a
local
ﬁeld
M
,
the
topology
of

may
be
always
be
recovered
solely
from
the
ﬁeld

that

that

additively
generated
by

×
subgroup
of
elements
of
M
that
are
inﬁnitely
divisible
by
powers
of
some
prime

In
particular,
the
Qp

structure
of

[for

p],
as
well
as
the

number

itself

the
unique

that

of

may
be
recovered
from
the
ﬁeld
structure
of
M
.
In
a
similar
vein,
given
a
function
ﬁeld
in
one
variable
M

over
M
,
consideration
of
the
discrete
valuations
on

reveals
that

In

of
these

formally
from

Theorem
A.

Next,
let
us
write
XK
→
X
K
for
the
compactiﬁcation
[cf.
§0]
of
XK
.
Let
x
∈
XK
6

be
a
closed
point.
Thus,
x
determines,
up
to
conjugation
by
an
element
of
ΠXK
,
a
decomposition
group:
Dx
⊆
ΠXK
We
shall
refer
to
a
closed
subgroup
of
ΠXK
which
arises
in
this
way
as
a
decomposition
group
of
ΠXK
.
If
x
is
a
cusp,
then
we
shall
refer
to
the
decomposition
group
Dx
as
cuspidal.
Note
that
Dx
always
surjects
onto
an
open
subgroup
of
GK
.
Moreover,
the
subgroup

def
Ix

is
isomorphic
to
Z(1)
[i.e.,
the
proﬁnite
completion
of
Z,
Tate

(respectively,

if
x
is
(respectively,
is
not)
a
cusp.
We
shall
refer
to
a
closed
subgroup
of
ΠXK
which
is
equal
to
“Ix
”
for
some
cusp
x
as
a
cuspidal
geometric
decomposition
group.
Theorem
1.3.
(Decomposition
Groups)
(i)
(Determination
of
the
Point)
The
closed
point
x
is
completely
determined
by
the
conjugacy
class
of
the
closed
subgroup
Dx
⊆
ΠXK
.
If
x
is
a

then
x
is
completely
determined
by

of
the

Ix

.
(ii)
(Commensurable
Terminality)
The
subgroup
Dx
is
commensurably
terminal
in
ΠXK
.
If
x
is
a
cusp,
then
Dx
=
CΠXK
(H)
for
any
open
subgroup
H
⊆

.
(iii)
(Absoluteness
of
Cuspidal
Decomposition
Groups)
Every
isomorphism
of
proﬁnite
groups
∼
α
:
ΠXK
→
ΠYL
preserves
cuspidal
decomposition
groups
and
cuspidal
geometric
decomposition
groups.
(iv)
(Cuspidal

Groups)
No
noncuspidal

group
of

is
contained
in
a
cuspidal

group
of

.
Proof.
The
ﬁrst
half
of
assertion
(i)
follows,
for
instance,
formally
from
[Mzk1],
Theorem
C;
the
second
half
of
assertion
(i)
follows
from
elementary
facts
about
fundamental
groups
of
topological
surfaces.
Assertion
(ii)

Assertion
(iii)

that

of

Deﬁnition
2.1.
(i)
We
shall
refer
to
an
open
immersion
XK
→
YK
as
a
partial
compactiﬁcation,
or
PC,
for
short,
of
XK
if
the
natural
open
immersion
XK
→
X
K
factors
as
the
composite
of
the
given
morphism
XK
→
YK
with
some
open
immersion
YK
→
X
K
.
By
abuse
of
notation,
we
shall
also
often
speak
of
“YK
”
as
a
PC
of
XK
.
(ii)
If
XK
→
YK
is
a
PC
such
that
YK
is
a
hyperbolic
curve,
then
we
shall
say
that
XK
→
YK
[or
YK
]
is
a
hyperbolic
partial
compactiﬁcation,
or
HPC,
of
XK
.
(iii)
If
XK
→
YK
is
a
PC
such
that
the
arrow
“→”
is
an
isomorphism,
then
we
shall
say
that
XK
→
YK
[or
YK
]
is
a
trivial
partial
compactiﬁcation
of
XK
.
Now
we
deﬁne
a
“category
of
dominant
localizations”
DLoc(XK
)
associated
to
the
hyperbolic
curve
XK
as
follows:
The
objects
of
this
category
are
the
hyperbolic
partial
compactiﬁcations
Y
→
Z
where
Y
is
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
some
ﬁeld
[which
is
necessarily
a
ﬁnite
separable
extension
of
K]
that
arises
as
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
Y
→
XK
.
The
morphisms
of
this
category
from
an
object
Y
→
Z
to
an
object
Y

→
Z

are
diagrams
of
the
form

Z

Z
where
the
vertical
morphisms
are
the
given
morphisms,
and
the
horizontal
morphism
is
a
dominant
morphism
of
schemes.
By
abuse
of
notation,
we
shall
often
simply
refer
to
the
horizontal
arrow
Z
→
Z

as
being
a
morphism
of
DLoc(XK
).
Similarly,
by
stipulating
that
all
schemes
appearing
in
the
deﬁnition
of
the
category
DLoc(XK
)
given
in
the
preceding
paragraph
be
equipped
with
K-structures
[where
we
take
the
K-structure
on
XK
to
be
the
given
K-structure]
and
that
all
morphisms
be
K-morphisms,
we
obtain
a
category
DLocK
(XK
)
together
with
a
natural
faithful
functor
DLocK
(XK
)
→
DLoc(XK
).
8
SHINICHI

Remark
2.2.0.
Thus,
the
category
DLoc(XK
)
is
reminiscent
of
the
category
“Loc(XK
)”
of
[Mzk3],
§2.
Indeed,
there
is
a
natural
faithful
functor
Loc(XK
)
→
DLoc(XK
)
whose
essential
image
consists
of
the
objects
Y
→
Z
which
are
trivial
partial
compactiﬁcations
and
the
dominant
morphisms
Z
→
Z

which
are
ﬁnite
étale.
In
particular,
if
we
denote
by
Ét(XK
)
the
category
of
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
XK
and
morphisms
over
XK
,
then
we
have
natural
faithful
functors:
Ét(XK
)
→
Loc(XK
)
→
DLoc(XK
)
Similarly,
we
have
natural
faithful
functors:
Ét(XK
)
→
LocK
(XK
)
→
DLocK
(XK
).
Proposition
2.2.
(Slimness
of
the
Category
of
Dominant
Localizations)
Suppose
that
K
is
a
local
ﬁeld.
Then
the
categories
DLoc(XK
),
DLocK
(XK
)
are
slim.
Proof.
Indeed,
by
using
the
various
copies
of
“Ét(Z)”
[where,
say,
Y
→
Z
is
an
object
of
DLoc(XK
)]
lying
inside
DLoc(XK
),
DLocK
(XK
)
[cf.
Remark
2.2.0],
the
slimness
of
the
categories
DLoc(XK
),
DLocK
(XK
)
follows
formally
from
Proposition
1.1,
(i)
[cf.
also
the
discussion
of
slimness
in
§0].

Next,
let
us
consider
the
category
DLocGK
(ΠXK
)
deﬁned
as
follows:
An
object
of
this
category
is
a
surjection
of
proﬁnite
groups
H
J
where
H
⊆
ΠXK
is
an
open
subgroup;
J
is
the
quotient
of
H
by
the
closed
normal
subgroup
generated
by
some
collection
of
cuspidal
geometric
decomposition

groups;
and
we
assume
that
J
is
“hyperbolic”,
in
the
sense
that
the
image
of
ΔX
H
in
J
is
nonabelian.
Given
two
objects
Hi

Ji
,
where
i
=
1,
2,
of
this
category,
a
morphism
in
this
category
is
deﬁned
to
be
a
diagram
of
the
form
H1
⏐
⏐

J1
H2
⏐
⏐

−→
J2
where
the
vertical
morphisms
are
the
given
morphisms,
and
the
horizontal
morphism
is
an
open
outer
homomorphism
that
is
compatible
with
the
various
natural
[open]
outer
homomorphisms
from
the
Hi
,
Ji
to
GK
.
Now
we
have
the
following
analogue
of
[Mzk3],
Theorem
2.4:
Theorem
2.3.
(Group-theoreticity

Corollary
2.6.
(The
Case
of
Once-punctured
Elliptic
Curves)
In
the
notation
of
Theorem
2.3,
let
us
suppose
further
that
XK
,
YL
are
once-punctured
elliptic
curves.
Then
the
isomorphism
∼
α
:
ΠXK
→
ΠYL
preserves
the
decomposition
groups
of
the
“torsion
closed
points”
—
i.e.,
the
closed
points
that
arise
from
torsion
points
of
the
underlying
elliptic
curve.
Moreover,
the
resulting
bijection
between
torsion
closed
points
of
XK
,
YL
is
compatible
with
∼
ab
the
isomorphism
on
abelianizations
of
geometric
fundamental
groups
Δab
X
→
ΔY
—
i.e.,
“Tate
modules”
—
induced
by
α.
Proof.
Indeed,
if
n
≥
1
is
an
integer,
write
φ
:
ZK
→
XK
for
the
ﬁnite
étale
covering
determined
by
“multiplication
by
n”.
Note
that
this
covering
may
also
be
described
more
group-theoretically
as
the
covering
associated
to
the
open
subgroup
H
⊆
ΠXK
[which
is
easily
veriﬁed
to
be
unique,
up
to
conjugation

in
ΠXK
]
such
that:
(i)
H
contains
a
cuspidal
decomposition
group
of
ab
ΠXK
;
(ii)
H
ΔX
is
equal
to
the
inverse
image
in
ΔX
of
the
subgroup
n·Δab
X
⊆
ΔX
.
Observe
that
ZK
admits
XK
as
an
HPC,
by
“ﬁlling
in”
all
of
the
cusps
other
that
the
“origin”.
Thus,
we
obtain
an
open
immersion
ψ
:
ZK
→
XK
—
i.e.,
an
object
of
DLocK
(XK
),
which
exhibits
the
closed
points
of
XK
that
arise
from
n-torsion
points
of
the
underlying
elliptic
curve
as
closed
points
of
DLoc-type
type.
Thus,
by
transporting
φ,
ψ
via
the
equivalences
of
Theorem
2.3,
(i),
and
applying
Theorem
1.3,
(ii),
(iii)
[as
in
the
proof
of
Corollary
2.5],
we
conclude
that
α
preserves
the
decomposition
groups
of
the
torsion
closed
points.
Finally,
the
compatibility
with
the
induced
morphism
on
Tate
modules
follows
by
considering
the
automorphisms
of
ZK
over
[i.e.,
relative
to
φ]
XK
,
after
possibly
enlarging
K.

Deﬁnition

We
shall
say
that
a
closed

x

K
is

if,
for

L
of
K,
some

Corollary
2.8.
(The
Case
of
Genus
Zero)
In
the
notation
of
Theorem
2.3,
let
us
suppose
further
that
XK
(respectively,
YL
)
is
isogenous
[cf.
§0]
to
a
hyperbolic
curve
of
genus
zero.
Then
the
isomorphism
∼
α
:
ΠXK
→
ΠYL
preserves
the
decomposition
groups
of
the
algebraic
closed
points.
In
particular,
XK
is
deﬁned
over
a
number
ﬁeld
[or,
equivalently:
XK
has
at
least
one
algebraic
point]
if
and
only
if
YL
is.
Proof.
By
Theorem
1.3,
(ii),
and
[the
“LocK
(−)
portion”
—
already
contained
in
[Mzk3],
Theorem
2.4
—
of]
Theorem
2.3,
(ii),
one
reduces
immediately
to
the
case
where
both
XK
and
YL
are
of
genus
zero.
Also,
by
Theorem
1.3,
(ii),
we
may
always
enlarge
K,
L
without
loss
of
generality;
in
particular,
we
may
assume
that
XK
,
YL
are
cuspidally
split,
so
that
both
curves
admit
a
[cuspidally
split]
tripod
as
an
HPC.
Then
we
argue
as
in
the
proof
of
Corollary
2.6:
That
is
to
say,
given
any
algebraic
x
∈
X
K
,
we
observe
that
[after
possibly
enlarging
K]
there
exists,
by
the
deﬁnition
of
“algebraic”
and
the
famous
main
result
of
[Belyi],
a
“Belyi
map”
β
:
XK
→
X
K
that
maps
x,
as
well
as
all
of
the
cusps
of
XK
,
to
cusps
of
X
K
,
and,
moreover,
is
unramiﬁed
over
the
open
subscheme
of
X
K
determined
by
the
tripod
that
forms
an
HPC
for
XK
.
In
particular,
β
is
unramiﬁed
over
the
open
subscheme
XK
⊆
X
K
.
Put
another
way,
there
exists
an
open
immersion
φ
:
ZK
→
XK
[i.e.,
an
HPC]
such
that
the
composite
β
◦
φ
factors
through
XK
⊆
X
K
in
such
a
way
that
the
resulting
morphism
βZ
:
ZK
→
XK
is
ﬁnite
étale.
In
particular,
βZ
exhibits
φ
as
an
object
of
DLocK
(XK
),
and
so
φ
exhibits
x
as
a
closed
point
of
DLoc-type.
Thus,
by
transporting
φ,
βZ
via
the
equivalences
of
Theorem
2.3,
(i),
and
applying
Theorem
1.3,
(ii),
(iii)
[as
in
the
proof
of
Corollary
2.5],
we
conclude
that
α
preserves
the
decomposition
groups
of
algebraic
closed
points,
as
desired.

Remark
2.8.1.
In
fact,
tracing
through
the
proofs
of
Corollaries
2.6,
2.8
shows
that
in
these
proofs,
we
did
not
actually
need
to
use
the
full
“Hom”
version
of
Theorem
1.2.
That
is
to
say,
for
these
proofs,
in
fact
the
“isomorphism
version”
∼
of
Theorem
1.2
[i.e.,
the
bijection
between
isomorphisms
“XK
→
YL
”
and
certain
∼
isomorphisms
“ΠXK
→
ΠYL
”],
applied
in
combination
with
Theorem
1.3,
(iii),
is
suﬃcient.
Indeed,
if
we
use
the
natural
faithful
functor
discussed
in

2.2.0
to
think
of
LocK
(XK

as

then

as

of

[i.e.,

Similarly,
we

be
the

we

Lemma
3.1.
(Criterion
for
Galois
Sections
Associated
to
Rational
Points)
Suppose
that
XK
is
deﬁned
over
a
number
ﬁeld,
i.e.,
there
exists
a
hyperbolic
curve
XK
over
a
number
ﬁeld
F
⊆
K
such
that
XK
=
XF
×F
K.
Let
σ
:
GK
→
ΠXK
be
a
section
such
that
Im(σ)
is
not
contained
in
any
cuspidal
decomposition
group
of
ΠXK
.
Then
the
following
conditions
on
σ
are
equivalent:
(i)
σ
arises
from
a
point
x
∈
XK
(K)
[i.e.,
“Im(σ)
=
Dx
”].
(ii)
For
every
integer
j
≥
1,
XK
[j,
σ](K)
=
∅.
(iii)
For
every
integer
j
≥
1,
XK
[j,
σ](K)alg
=
∅
[where
the
superscript
“alg”
denotes
the
subset
of
algebraic
[K-rational]
closed
points].
(iv)
For
every
integer
j
≥
1,
ΠXK
[j,σ]
contains
a
decomposition
group
[i.e.,
relative
to
ΠXK
]
of
an
algebraic
closed
point
of
XK
that
surjects
onto
GK
.
Proof.
(i)
=⇒
(ii):
It
follows
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
x
∈
XK
(K)
lifts
to
a
point
of
∈
XK
[j,
σ](K),
for
all
j
≥
1,
which
implies
(ii).
(iii)
=⇒
(ii),
(iv);
(iv)
=⇒
(iii):
Immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions.
(ii)
=⇒
(i):
For
j
≥
1,
choose
points
xj
∈
XK
[j,
σ](K).
Since
the
topological
space

X
K
[j,
σ](K)
j≥1
is
compact,
it
follows
that
there
exists
some
inﬁnite
set
of
positive
integers
J

such
that
for
any
j
≥
1,
the
images
of
the
xj

,
where
j

≥
j,
in
X
K
[j,
σ](K)
converge
to
a
point
yj
∈
X
K
[j,
σ](K).
Moreover,
note
that,
by
the
deﬁnition
of
yj
,
it
follows
that
if
j1
>
j2
,
then
yj1
maps
to
yj2
in
X
K
[j2
,
σ](K).
In
particular,
if
we
write
y
∈
X
K
(K)
for
the
image
of
the
yj
in
X
K
(K),
then
it
follows
formally
from
14
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
the
fact
that
the
yj
form
a
compatible
sequence
of
points
of
the
sets
X
K
[j,
σ](K)
that
Im(σ)
is
contained
in
the
decomposition
group
[well-deﬁned
up
to
conjugation]
Dy
.
On
the
other
hand,
by
our
assumption
that
Im(σ)
is
not
contained
in
any
cuspidal
decomposition
group
of
ΠXK
,
we
conclude
that
y
is
not
a
cusp,
hence
that
“Im(σ)
=
Dy
”,
as
desired.
(ii)
=⇒
(iii):
Given
a
point
xj
∈
XK
[j,
σ](K)
with
image
x
∈
XK
(K)
=
XF
(K),
it
follows
from
“Krasner’s
lemma”
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Kobl],
p.
69-70]
that
one
may
approximate
x
by
a
point
x
∈
XF
(F

)
⊆

(K)
=
XK
(K),
where
F


K
is
a

which
is
suﬃciently
close
to
x
that
[just
like
x]
it
lifts
to
a

[j,

which
is
necessarily
algebraic,
as
desired.

Corollary
3.2.
(Absoluteness
of
Decomposition
Groups
for
Genus
Zero)
Let
K,
L
be
local
ﬁelds;
XK
(respectively,
YL
)
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
K
(respectively,
L),
which
is,
in
fact,
deﬁned
over
a
number
ﬁeld.
Suppose,
moreover,
that
XK
(respectively,
YL
)
is
isogenous
[cf.
§0]
to
a
hyperbolic
curve
of
genus
zero.
Then
every
isomorphism
of
proﬁnite
groups
∼
α
:
ΠXK
→
ΠYL
preserves
the
decomposition
groups
of
the
closed
points.
Proof.
Indeed,
Corollary
3.2
follows
formally
from
Corollary
2.8;
Theorem
1.3,
(iii),
(iv);
and
the
equivalence
(i)
⇐⇒
(iv)
of

Remark
3.2.1.
Since
any
once-punctured
elliptic
curve
is
isogenous
to
a
hyperbolic
curve
of
genus
zero,
one
might
think,
at
ﬁrst
glance,
that
Corollary
2.6
is
[essentially]
a
“special
case”
of
Corollary
3.2.
In
fact,
however,
this
is
false,
since
Corollary
2.6
applies
even
to
curves
which
are
not
necessarily
deﬁned
over
a
number
ﬁeld.

Proposition
4.4.
(Tame
Integral
Absoluteness)
Suppose
that
XK
has
stable
reduction
over
OK
.
Then:
(i)
Every
cusp
of
XK
is
tamely
integrally
absolute.
(ii)
A
cusp
of
XK
is
discretely
absolute
if
and
only
if
it
is
integrally
absolute.
Proof.
Assertion
(ii)
follows
formally
from
assertion
(i)
and
the
fact
that
the

is
injective.
Now
we
consider


Z


to
Z

Z
restriction
of
the

assertion
(i).
First,
let
us
observe
that
it
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
it
suﬃces
to
prove
assertion
(i)
after
replacing
XK
by
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
XK
that
extends
to
an
admissible
covering
of
the
stable
model
of
XK
.
In
particular,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
every
irreducible
component
of
the
normalization
of
the
geometric
special
ﬁber
of
this
stable
model
has
genus
≥
1.
Next,
let
us
recall
the
“étale
quotient”
ΠXK

Πet
XK
of
[Mzk2],
§2.
Thus,
the
ﬁnite
quotients
of
Πet
XK
correspond
to
the
coverings
of
XK
that
arise
from
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
the
stable
model
of
XK
that
are
tamely
ramiﬁed
at
the
cusps.
In
particular,
the
quotient
of
GK
determined
by
Πet
XK
is
the
natural
quotient
GK

Gk
,
where
k
is
the
residue

of
K.
If
x
is
a
cusp
of
XK
,
then
[in

of
our
assumption
that

component

In
particular,
the
splittings
of
this
exact
sequence
form
a

Ix

Ix
⊗
Z
torsor
over
H

(Gk

These

be
thought

is
equal
to
the
identity
element
of
H

(Ix
,
Ix
)
=
Hom(Ix

Ix
).
Thus,
unraveling
the
deﬁnitions,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
the
pull-back
to
Dx
of
any
such
element
of
H
1
(Dx

forms
an
element
of
H
1
(Dx
,

which
determines
the
canonical

integral
structure
on

Since
the
étale
quotient
is
compatible
with
isomorphisms
α
as
in
Theorem
2.3
[cf.
[Mzk2],
Lemma
2.2,

we
thus
conclude
that
x
is
tamely
integrally
absolute,
as
desired.

Proposition
4.5.
(Absoluteness
and
Coverings)
Let
Z
→
XK
be
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering.
Let
z
be
a
closed
point
of
the
compactiﬁcation
Z
of
Z
that
maps
to
a
closed
point
x
of
X
K
.
Then:
(i)
z
is
absolute
(respectively,
a
discretely
absolute
cusp)
if
and
only
if
x

(ii)
Suppose
that
XK
,
Z
have
stable
reduction
[over
the
rings
of
integers
of
their
respective
ﬁelds
of
constants].
Then
z
is
an
integrally
absolute
cusp
if
and
only
if
x
is.
Proof.
Assertion
(i)
is
immediate
from

Before
proceeding,
we
recall
the
following
well-known
result:
Lemma
4.6.
(Vanishing

Invariants

Tate
Module)
We
0

have:
H
(GK
,
H
(ΔX
,
μZ
(K)))
=
0.
def
,
i.e.,
the
Tate
module
of
the
Jacobian
JX
of
X
K
,
is
Proof.
Since
TX
=
Δab
X
isomorphic
to
its
Cartier
dual,
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
H
0
(GK
,
TX
)
=
0,
i.e.,
that
the
torsion
subgroup
of
JX
(K)
is
ﬁnite.
Since
JX
is
a
proper
group
scheme
over
K,
it
follows
that
the
p-adic
topology
on
K
determines
a
p-adic
topology
on
JX
(K)
with
respect
to
which
JX
(K)
forms
a
compact
p-adic
Lie
group.
As
is
well-known
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Serre],
Chapter
V,
§7],
the
exponential
map
for
this
p-adic
Lie
group
determines
an
isomorphism
of
a
certain
open
neighborhood
of
the
identity
of
JX
(K)
with
a
free
Zp
-module
of
ﬁnite
rank.
Thus,
the
desired
ﬁniteness
follows
formally
from
this
isomorphism,
together
with
the
compactness
of
JX
(K).

the

for

an

since,

it
follows
that,

In

we
obtain

Write

we
obtain

Thus,

are
the
maps
obtained
by
associating

a

Put

be
characterized

Suppose

Then
if

then
every
cusp
of
XK
is
integrally
absolute.
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
In
light
of
Proposition
4.5,
(i),
we
may
assume
that
XK
is
coabsolute.
Let
U
∈
HX
be
a
coabsolute
unit
of
XK
;
let
x
be
a
cusp
of
XK
at
which
U
fails
to
be
invertible.
If
U
has
a
zero
of
order
(Z
)
n
=
0
at
x,
then
the
restriction
of
the
class
ηU
∈
H
1
(ΠXK
,
μZ
(K))
determined
by
U
to
Dx
determines
a
splitting
of
the
torsor
obtained
by
applying
a
change
of
structure
group
to
the
(K
×
)∧
-torsor
at
x
via
the
map
(K
×
)∧
→
(K
×
)∧

given
by
multiplication
by
n.
Since
n
=
0,
and
Z/Z
is
divisible,
it
thus
follows
that
this
splitting
is
suﬃcient
to
determine
the
canonical
discrete
structure
on
Dx
.
Let
us
write
U
∈
EX
for
the
image
of
ηU
in
EX
.
Then
U
determines
the
set
(K
×
)∧
·
ηU
.
On
the
other
hand,
since
U
is
coabsolute,
it
follows
that
X
K
admits
an
absolute
point
x
at
which
U
is
invertible.
Thus,
the
subset
K
×
·
ηU
⊆
(K
×
)∧
·
ηU
may
be
characterized
as
the
set
of
elements
of
(K
×
)∧
·
ηU
whose
restriction
to
Dx
—
which
[by
the
invertibility
of
U
at
x
]
necessarily
lies
in
(K

)∧
∼
=
H

(GK

μZ

⊆
H
1
(Dx
,
μZ
(K))
—
in
fact
lies
inside
K
×
⊆
(K
×
)∧
.
Thus,
Theorem
4.3,
Proposition
4.7,
together
with
the
absoluteness
of
x
,
imply
that
x
is
discretely
absolute,
as
desired.
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
Let
x
be
a
discretely
absolute
cusp
or
an
absolute
noncusp
of
XK
.
Then,
as
in
the
argument
applied
in
the
proof
of
assertion
(i),
the
image
of
HX
in
H
1
(ΠXK
,
μZ
(K))
may
be
characterized
as
the
set
of
elements
lying
over
elements
of
EX
whose
restriction
to
Dx
determines
a
class
in
H
1
(Dx
,
μZ
(K))
that
lies
in
the
submodule
of
this
cohomology
module
generated
by
the
elements
that
deﬁne
splittings
“compatible
with
the
canonical
discrete
structure
on
Dx
”
[where
in
the
noncuspidal
case,
we
take
this
compatibility
to
mean
that
the
restriction
to
Dx
lies
in
K
×
⊆
(K
×
)∧
,
as
in
the
proof
of
assertion
(i)].
Thus,
assertion
(ii)
follows
from
Theorem
4.3,
Proposition
4.7,
together
with
the
discrete
absoluteness
[in
the
cuspidal
case]
or
absoluteness
[in
the
noncuspidal
case]
of
x.
Next,
we
observe
that
assertion
(iii)
follows
via
the
argument
applied
in
the
proof
of
assertion
(i),
since
the
hypothesis
that
XK
is
unitwise
absolute
and
subprincipally
ample
implies
that
for
every
cusp
x
of
XK
,
there
exists
a
unit
U
∈
HX
that
is
not
invertible
at
x
and
whose
class
in
H
1
(ΠXK

μZ

is
mapped
[in
the
notation
of
Theorem
2.3]

zero.
Then
XK
is
quasi-coabsolute,
subprincipally
quasi-ample,
and
unitwise
absolute.
In
particular,
if
XK
has
stable
reduction
over
OK
,
then
every
cusp
of
XK
is
integrally
absolute.
Proof.
In
light
of
Theorem
4.10,
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
if
XK
is
of
genus
zero
and
cuspidally
split,
then
XK
is
coabsolute
and
subprincipally
ample.
But
since
cusps
are
always
absolute
[cf.
Theorem
1.3,
(iii)],
these
properties
follow
formally
from
the
following
two
elementary
facts:
(a)
every
divisor
of
degree
0
on
X
K
is
principal;
(b)
XK
has
at
least
3
cusps.

situations,
the

admits
an
even
“ﬁner

of

group”,
as
follows:
Corollary
4.12.
(The
Case
of
Once-punctured
Elliptic
Curves)
Let
XK
be
a
once-punctured
elliptic
curve
over
a
local
ﬁeld
K
of
residue
characteristic
=
2.
Suppose
that
XK
has
stable
reduction
over
OK
.
Also,
if
n
≥
1
is
an
×
for
the
subgroup
of
n-th
roots
of
unity.
Then
integer,
we
shall
write
μn
(K)
⊆
OK
there
exists
a
μ12
(K)-torsor
structure
at
the
unique
cusp
x
of
XK
which
is
compatible
with
the
canonical
integral
structure
arising
from
the
stable
model
X
log
and,
moreover,
is
preserved
by
arbitrary
automorphisms
of
ΠXK
.
Proof.
We
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
all
of
the
2-torsion
points
of
the
underlying
elliptic
curve
of
XK
are
deﬁned
over
K.
Write
YK
→
XK
for
the
Galois
covering
of
degree
4
determined
by
the
“multiplication
by
2”
map
on
the
underlying
elliptic
curve
of
XK
[so
YK
is
hyperbolic
of
type
(1,
4)]
and
Y
log
for
the
stable
model
over
Spec(OK
)log
[where
the
log
structure
on
Spec(OK
)
is
that
log
determined
by
the
closed
point]
of
the
smooth
log
curve
Y
K
determined
by
YK
.
Also,
let
us
write
e1
,
e2
,
e3
,
e4
for
the
four
cusps
of
YK
.
∼
Let
α
:
ΠXK
→
ΠXK
be
an
automorphism
of
ΠXK
.
Note
that,
by
Theorem
1.3,
(ii),
any
μ12
(K)-torsor
structure
at
x
is
preserved
by
arbitrary
inner
automorphisms
of
ΠXK
.
Thus,
we
may
assume
[by
composing
with
a
suitable
inner
automorphism
that
induces
a
suitable
element
of
Gal(YK
/XK
)]
that
the
natural
action
of
α
on
the
cusps
of
YK
[cf.
Theorem
1.3,
(iii)]
preserves
e1
.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
[by
the
well-known
deﬁnition
of
the
group
law
on
an
def
elliptic
curve;
the
deﬁnition
of
YK
→
XK
]
the
divisor
D
=
2[e1
]
−
2[e2
]
on
YK
is
principal.
Thus,
there
exists
a
unique
rational
function
f
on
YK
whose
divisor
of
zeroes
and
poles
is
D
and
whose
value
at
e3
is
1.
Since
D
has
multiplicity
2
at
24
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
e1
,
it
follows
that
f
determines
a
μ2
(K)-torsor
structure
at
e1
,
hence
also
at
x.
Write
η
for
the
Kummer
class
[i.e.,
the
image
under
the
Kummer
map]
of
f
.
In
the
following,
we
shall
write
Kummer
classes
additively.
Now,
observe
that,
by
Proposition
4.7;
Theorem
1.3,
(iii),
if
α
ﬁxes
all
four
cusps
of
YK
,
then
it
follows
that
α
preserves
the
class
η,
hence
also
the
μ2
(K)-torsor
structure
at
x
determined
by
η.
Next,
let
us
write
Σ
for
the
group
of
permutations
of
the
three
cusps
e2
,
e3
,
e4
that
arise
from
automorphisms
β
∈
Aut(ΠXK
)
that
preserve
e1
.
Thus,
the
order
s
of
Σ
divides
6.
Let
β1
,
.
.
.
,
βs
∈
Aut(ΠXK
)
be
a
collection
of
automorphisms
that
give
rise
to
the
elements
of
Σ.
Set:

def
η
=
(6/s)
·
s

η
βj
j=1
Since
YK
is
unitwise
absolute
by
Corollary
4.11,
it
follows
that
η

arises
from
a
rational
function
f

on
YK
which
has
a
pole
of
order
12
at
e1
.
In
particular,
η

determines
a
μ12
(K)-torsor
structure
at
e1
,
hence
also
at
x.
Moreover,
it
follows
formally
from
the
preceding
observation
concerning
automorphisms
α
that
ﬁx
all
four
cusps
of
YK
that
arbitrary
α
[i.e.,
that
are
only
assumed
to
ﬁx
e1
]
preserve
the
μ12
(K)-torsor
structure
determined
by
η

.
Finally,
the
fact
that
this
μ12
(K)-torsor
structure
is
compatible
with
the
canonical
integral
structure
follows
from
the
easily
veriﬁed
fact
that
the
rational
function
f
is
generically
invertible
[in
light
of
our
assumption
that
the
residue
charactertistic
of
K
is
=
2]
on
the
special
ﬁber
of
Y.
This
completes
the
proof.

Remark
4.12.1.
The
number
“12”
appearing
in
Corollary
4.12
is
interesting
in
light
of
the
well-known
fact
that
the
line
bundle
on
the
moduli
stack
of
elliptic
curves
determined
by
the
cotangent
bundle
at
the
origin
of
the
tautological
family
of
elliptic
curves
has
order
12
in
the
Picard
group
of
this
moduli
stack.
Remark
4.12.2.
It
seems
natural
to
expect
that
a(n)
[perhaps
somewhat
more
complicated]
analogue
of
Corollary
4.12
should
hold
for
more
general
hyperbolic
curves
XK
.
This
topic,
however,
lies
beyond
the
scope
of
this
paper.
