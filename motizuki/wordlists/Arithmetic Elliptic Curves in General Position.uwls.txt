We
combine
various
well-known
techniques
from
the
theory
of
heights,
the
theory
of
“noncritical
Belyi
maps”,
and
classical
analytic
number
theory
to
conclude
that
the
“ABC
Conjecture”,
or,
equivalently,
the
so-called
“Eﬀective
Mordell
Conjecture”,
holds
for
arbitrary
rational
points
of
the
projective
line
minus
three
points
if
and
only
if
it
holds
for
rational
points
which
are
in
“suﬃciently
general
position”
in
the
sense
that
the
following
properties
are
satisﬁed:
(a)
the
rational
point
under
consideration
is
bounded
away
from
the
three
points
at
inﬁnity
at
a
given
ﬁnite
set
of
primes;
(b)
the
Galois
action
on
the
l-power
torsion
points
of
the
corresponding
elliptic
curve
determines
a
surjection
onto
GL2
(
l),
for
some
prime
number
l
which
is
roughly
of
the
order
of
the
sum
of
the
height
of
the
elliptic
curve
and
the
logarithm
of
the
discriminant
of
the
minimal
ﬁeld
of
deﬁnition
of
the
elliptic
curve,
but
does
not
divide
the
conductor
of
the
elliptic
curve,
the
rational
primes
that
are
absolutely
ramiﬁed
in
the
minimal
ﬁeld
of
deﬁnition
of
the
elliptic
curve,
or
the
local
heights
[i.e.,
the
orders
of
the
q-parameter
at
primes
of
[bad]
multiplicative
reduction]
of
the
elliptic
curve.
Introduction
In
the
classical
intersection
theory
of
subvarieties,
or
cycles,
on
algebraic
varieties,
various
versions
of
the
“moving
lemma”
allow
one
to
replace
a
given
cycle
by
another
cycle
which
is
equivalent,
from
the
point
of
view
of
intersection
theory,
to
the
given
cycle,
but
is
supported
on
subvarieties
which
are
in
a
“more
convenient”
position
—
i.e.,
typically,
a
“more
general”
position,
which
is
free
of
inessential,
exceptional
pathologies
—
within
the
ambient
variety.
In
the
present
paper,
after
reviewing,
partly
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
notation
and
terminology,
the
general
theory
of
heights
in
§1,
we
proceed
in
§2
to
apply
the
theory
of
“noncritical
Belyi
maps”
of
[Mzk1],
together
with
a
technique
developed
by
Elkies
[cf.
[Elkies];
[vF]]
—
which,
in
fact,
may
be
traced
back
to
the
work
of
Moret-Bailly
and
Szpiro
[cf.
the
discussion
at
the
top
of
[Elkies],
p.
106]
—
for
relating
Belyi
maps
to
the
ABC
Conjecture,
to
show
that
the
ABC,
Eﬀective
Mordell,
and
Vojta
Conjectures
for
arbitrary
rational
points
of
hyperbolic
curves
over
number
ﬁelds
are
equivalent
to
the
ABC
Conjecture
for
rational
points
over
a
number
ﬁeld
of
the
projective
line
minus
three
points
which
lie
in
some
“compactly
bounded
subset”
of
the
set
of
all
rational
points
[cf.
Theorem
2.1].
Here,
“compactly
bounded”
means
that
at
some
ﬁnite
collection
S
of
primes
of
the
number
ﬁeld
that
Typeset
by
AMS-TEX

2
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
includes
the
archimedean
primes,
the
rational
points
lie
in
some
given
compact
subset
of
the
set
of
rational
points
of
the
projective
line
minus
three
points
over
the
completion
of
the
number
ﬁeld
at
the
given
prime
[cf.
Example
1.3,
(ii)].
Such
compactly
bounded
subsets
of
the
set
of
rational
points
are
of
interest
since
the
height
of
a
rational
point
that
lies
in
such
a
compactly
bounded
subset
may
be
computed,
up
to
a
bounded
discrepancy,
by
considering
the
distance
of
the
rational
point
from
the
divisor
at
inﬁnity
solely
at
the
primes
that
do
not
lie
over
primes
of
S.
Thus,
in
summary,
we
use
the
noncritical
Belyi
maps
of
[Mzk1]
to
“move
the
rational
points
over
number
ﬁelds
of
interest
away
from
the
divisor
at
inﬁnity
at
the
primes
lying
over
[typically
archimedean!]
primes
of
S”.
This
use
of
Belyi
maps
is
interesting
in
that
it
is
reminiscent
of
the
use
of
Belyi
maps
in
the
technique
of
“Belyi
cuspidalization”
[cf.
[Mzk2],
§2,
§3;
[Mzk3],
§2;
[Mzk4],
§3].
That
is
to
say,
in
the
technique
of
Belyi
cuspidalization,
“critical”
[i.e.,
more
precisely,
“not
necessarily
noncritical”!]
Belyi
maps
are
used
to
“move
rational
points
closer
to
the
divisor
at
inﬁnity
at
nonarchimedean
primes”
[cf.,
especially,
the
theory
of
[Mzk2],
§3].
Theorem
2.1
Belyi
cuspidalization
uses
noncritical
Belyi
maps
moves
rational
points
of
interest
away
from
divisor
at
inﬁnity
of
interest
primarily
at
archimedean
primes
of
a
number
ﬁeld
uses
critical
Belyi
maps
moves
rational
points
of
interest
closer
to
divisor
at
inﬁnity
of
interest
at
nonarchimedean
primes
of
a
number
ﬁeld
In
particular,
the
use
of
Belyi
maps
in
Theorem
2.1
of
the
present
paper
proceeds,
so
to
speak,
in
the
“opposite
direction”
to
their
use
in
the
theory
of
Belyi
cuspidalization.
Finally,
in
§3,
§4,
we
examine
another
example
of
the
notion
of
being
“arithmetically
in
general
position”,
namely,
the
phenomenon
of
“full
Galois
actions”
—
i.e.,
Galois
actions
whose
images
are
equal
to
either
SL2
(Zl
)
or
GL2
(Zl
)
—
on
the
l-power
torsion
points
of
an
elliptic
curve
over
a
number
ﬁeld
for
some
prime
number
l.
More
precisely,
we
combine
the
techniques
of
[Serre],
[Falt]
relating
isogenies
and
heights
of
elliptic
curves
over
number
ﬁelds
[cf.
§3]
with
some
classical
analytic
number
theory
involving
the
prime
number
theorem
[cf.
§4]
to
show
[cf.
Corollaries
4.3,
4.4]
that
if
one
considers
elliptic
curves
over
number
ﬁelds
of
bounded
degree
which
are
either
“degenerating”
[i.e.,
admit
at
least
one
prime
of
potentially
multiplicative
reduction]
or
“compactly
bounded
away
from
inﬁnity”
[cf.
Theorem
2.1],
then,
with
ﬁnitely
many
possible
exceptions,
one
obtains
a
“full
Galois
action”
for
some
prime
number
l
which
is
roughly
of
the
order
of
the
sum
of
the
height
of
the
elliptic
curve
and
logarithm
of
the
discriminant
of
the
minimal
ﬁeld
of
deﬁnition
of
the
elliptic
curve
and,
moreover,
is
prime
to
various
numbers
that
are,
in
some

sense,
characteristic
to
the
elliptic
curve,
such
as
the
conductor
of
the
elliptic
curve,
the
rational
primes
that
are
absolutely
ramiﬁed
in
the
minimal
ﬁeld
of
deﬁnition
of
the
elliptic
curve,
and
the
local
heights
[i.e.,
the
orders
of
the
q-parameter
at
primes
of

of
the
elliptic
curve.
Section
1:
Generalities
on
Heights
In
the
present
§1,
we
review,
partly
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
notation
and
terminology,
various
well-known
facts
concerning
arithmetic
line
bundles
and
heights.
Let
X
be
a
normal
scheme
which
is
proper
and
ﬂat
over
Spec(Z)
[where
Z
def
denotes
the
ring
of
rational
integers].
Write
XQ
=
X
×Z
Q
for
the
generic
ﬁber
of
X;
X
arc
for
the
compact
normal
complex
analytic
space
determined
by
X.
Thus,
the
underlying
topological
space
of
X
arc
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
set
of
complex
points
X(C),
equipped
with
the
topology
induced
by
the
topology
of
C.
Note,
moreover,
that
the
complex
conjugation
automorphism
ιC
of
C
induces
a
complex
conjugation
automorphism
ιX
of
X
arc
which
is
compatible
with
ιC
.
Deﬁnition
1.1.
(i)
We
shall
refer
to
as
an
arithmetic
line
bundle
L
=
(L,
|
−
|L
)
on
X
any
pair
consisting
of
a
line
bundle
L
on
X
and
a
hermitian
metric
|
−
|L
on
the
line
bundle
Larc
determined
by
L
on
X
arc
that
is
compatible
[in
the
evident
sense]
with
the
complex
conjugation
automorphism
ιX
.
If
L
=
(L,
|
−
|L
),
M
=
(M,
|
−
|M
)
are
arithmetic
line
bundles
on
X,
then
a
morphism
L
→
M
is
deﬁned
to
be
a
morphism
of
line
bundles
L
→
M
such
that
locally
on
X
arc
,
sections
of
L
with
|
−
|L
≤
1
map
to
sections
of
M
with
|
−
|M
≤
1.
We
deﬁne
the
set
Γ(L)
of
global
sections
of
L
=
(L,
|
−
|L
)
over
X
to
be
the
set
of
morphisms
OX
→
L,
where
we
write
OX
for
the
trivial
line
bundle
OX
equipped
with
the
trivial
hermitian
metric.
There
is
an
evident
notion
of
tensor
product
of
arithmetic
line
bundles
on
X.
The
isomorphism
classes
of
arithmetic
line
bundles
on
X,
together
with
the
operation
of
tensor
product,
thus
determine
a
group
APic(X).
(ii)
Let
φ
:
Y
→
X
be
a
morphism
of
normal,
Z-proper,
Z-ﬂat
schemes.
Then
there
is
an
evident
notion
of
pull-back
of
arithmetic
line
bundles
by
φ.
If
L
is
an
arithmetic
line
bundle
on
X,
then
we
shall
denote
its
pull-back
to
Y
by
the
notation
φ∗
L
or,
when
there
is
no
fear
of
confusion,
L|Y
.
Let
F
be
a
number
ﬁeld
[i.e.,
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
the
rational
number
ﬁeld
Q],
we
denote
by
whose
ring
of
integers
we
denote
by
OF
,
and
whose
set
of
valuations

non
V(F
)arc
of
V(F
).
Thus,
V(F
)
decomposes
as
a
disjoint
union
V(F
)
=
V(F
)
nonarchimedean
and
archimedean
valuations.
If
v
∈
V(F
),
then
we
shall
write
Fv
for
the
completion
of
F
at
v
and
|
−
|v
:
Fv
→
R
for
the
real-valued
valuation
map
determined
by
v.
If
v
∈
V(F
)non
,
then
we
shall
write
ordv
(−)
:
Fv
→
Z
for
the
order
deﬁned
by
v
and
qv
for
the
cardinality
of
the
residue
ﬁeld
of
Fv
.

An
arithmetic
divisor
on
F
is
deﬁned
to
be
a
ﬁnite
formal
sum

cv
·
v
v∈V(F
)
—
where
cv
∈
Z
if
v
∈
V(F
)non
and
cv
∈
R
if
v
∈
V(F
)arc
[cf.
[Szp],
§1.1].
Here,
if
all
of
the
cv
are
≥
0,
then
we
shall
say
that
the
arithmetic
divisor
is
eﬀective.
Thus,
the
arithmetic
divisors
on
F
naturally
form
a
group
ADiv(F
).
If
f
∈
F
,
then
the
assignment
def
f
→
ADiv(f
)
=

ordv
(f
)
·
v
−
v∈V(F
)non

[Fv
:
R]
·
log(|f
|v
)
·
v
v∈V(F
)arc
[where
log
denotes
the
natural
logarithm]
determines
an
element
∈
ADiv(F
),
which
we
shall
refer
to
as
the
principal
arithmetic
divisor
associated
to
f
.
Thus,
the
principal
arithmetic
divisors
determine
a
subgroup
APrc(F
)
⊆
ADiv(F
).
Moreover,
as
is
well-known,
there
is
a
natural
isomorphism
∼
ADiv(F
)/APrc(F
)
→
APic(Spec(OF
))
—
cf.
[Szp],
Proposition
1.1.
In
particular,
the
degree
map
degF
:
ADiv(F
)/APrc(F
)
→
R
deﬁned
by
sending
V(F


v
→
log(qv
);
V(F
)arc

v
→

[cf.
[Szp],
§1.1]
determines
a
homomorphism
APic(Spec(OF
))
→
R,
which
we
shall
also
denote
by
degF
.
When
there
is
no
fear
of
confusion,
we
shall
also
regard
[by
abuse
of
notation]
degF
as
a
map
deﬁned
on
ADiv(F
).
Note
that
if
we
set
def
degF
=
[F1:Q]
·
degF
,
then
for
any
ﬁnite
extension
K
of
F
,
it
follows
that
degK
(L|Spec(OK
)
)
=
degF
(L)
for
any
arithmetic
line
bundle
L
on
Spec(OF
).
In
particular,
if
Q
is
an
algebraic
closure
of
Q,
then
for
any
x
∈
X(Q)
=

X(F
)
Q⊇F,
[F
:Q]<∞
and
any
arithmetic
line
bundle
M
on
X,
it
makes
sense
to
deﬁne
def
htM
(x)
=
degF
(x∗F
M)
∈
R
—
where
xF
:
Spec(OF
)
→
X
is
any
morphism
that
gives
rise
to
x.

(i)
We
shall
refer
to
the

as
the

function
associated
to
the
arithmetic
line
bundle
M.
(ii)
Fix
a
subset
F
⊆
X(Q).
If
α,
β
:

are
functions,
then
we
shall
write
α
F
β
(respectively,
α

β;
α

β)
if
there
exists
a
[“constant”]
C

such
that
β(x)

(respectively,
α(x)

for
all
x

F
;
we
shall
omit
the

when
there

no
fear
of
confusion.
[Thus,
α
≈
β
if
and
only
if
α

β
and
α

The
relation
“≈”
clearly
deﬁnes
an
equivalence
relation
on
the
set
of
functions
F

we
shall
refer
to
an
equivalence
class
relative
to
this
equivalence
relation
as
a(n)
[F

[i.e.,
“bounded

The
BD-class
of
α
will
be
denoted
by
[α]F
,
or
simply
[α],
when
there
is
no
fear
of
confusion.
Finally,
we
observe
that
it
makes
sense
to
apply
the
notation
“”,
“”,
“≈”
to
BD-classes.

such

over

is

then
we

that

Let

refer

We

refer
to
a

X(Q)
obtained

as

in
this
fashion
as

support
of
the

and
to
the

as
the
bounding

of
the
compactly
bounded

Note
that
by
applying
well-known
approximation
results
in
elementary
number
theory,
it
follows
immediately
[cf.
the
deﬁnition
given
above
of
the
term
“compact

that
the
bounding
domains
of
a
compactly
bounded
subset
of
X(Q),
hence
also
the
support
of
a
compactly
bounded
subset
of
X(Q),
are
completely
determined
by
the
compactly
bounded
subset
itself.
Proposition
1.4.
(Basic
Properties
of
Heights)
In
the
notation
of
the
above
discussion,
let
L
=
(L,
|
−
|L
),
M
=
(M,
|
−
|M
)
be
arithmetic
line
bundles
on
def
def
X.
Write
LQ
=
L|XQ
,
MQ
=
M|XQ
.
Then:
(i)
We
have
htL⊗M
(x)
=
htL
(x)
+
htM
(x)
for
x
∈
X(Q).
(ii)
If
some
positive
tensor
power
of
the
line
bundle
LQ
on
XQ
is
generated
by
global
sections
[for
instance,
if
the
line
bundle
LQ
is
ample],
then
htL

0
[i.e.,
where
“”
denotes
“X(Q)
”].
(iii)
The
BD-class
of
htL
depends
only
on
the
isomorphism
class
of
the
line
bundle
LQ
on
XQ
.
In
particular,
it
makes
sense
to
write
[htL
]
or
[htLQ
]
for
the
BD-class
[htL
]
of
htL
.
(iv)
Let
d
be
a
positive
integer,
C
∈
R.
Suppose
further
that
the
line
bundle
LQ
is
ample
on
XQ
.
Then
the
set
of
points
x
∈
X(Q)≤d
[cf.
Example
1.3,
(i)]
such
that
htL
(x)
≤
C
is
ﬁnite.
Proof.
Assertion
(i)
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions.
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
To
verify
assertion
(ii),
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
if
s
∈
Γ(XQ
,
LQ
),
and
we
write
F
⊆
X(Q)
for
the
subset
of
points
at
which
s
is
nonzero,
then
htL
F
0.
Now
observe
that
if
M
is
an
arithmetic
line
bundle
that
arises
[by
pull-back
to
X]
from
an
arithmetic
line
bundle
on
Spec(Z),
then
htL⊗M
≈X(Q)
htL
ARITHMETIC
ELLIPTIC
CURVES
IN
GENERAL
POSITION
7
[cf.
assertion
(i)].
Moreover,
for
a
suitable
choice
of
M
arising
from
an
arithmetic
line
bundle
on
Spec(Z),
the
section
s
determines
a
section
t
of
LQ
⊗MQ
that
extends
to
a
section
of
L
⊗
M
over
X
such
that
|t|L⊗M
≤
1
on
X
arc
[where
we
recall
that
X
arc
is
compact!].
Thus,
by
replacing
L
by
L
⊗
M
and
s
by
t,
we
may
assume
that
s
determines
a
section
of
L
over
X
and
that
|s|L
≤
1
on
X
arc
.
Now
the
fact
that
htL
(x)
≥
0
for
all
x
∈
F
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Next,
to
verify
assertion
(iii),
it
suﬃces
to
apply
assertions
−1
(i),
(ii)
to
the
arithmetic
line
bundle
L
⊗
M
in
the
situation
where
LQ
∼
=
MQ
.
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iv).
A
proof
of
this
well-known
fact
may,
essentially,
be
found
in
[Silv1]
[cf.
[Silv1],
Theorem
2.1].
From
the
point
of
view
of
the
present
discussion,
an
argument
may
be
given
as
follows:
First,
we
observe
that
[some
positive
tensor
power
of]
the
ample
line
bundle
LQ
yields
an
embedding
Q
:
XQ
⊆
PQ
,
where
P
=
PnZ
is
a
projective
space
over
Z.
Next,
by
blowing
up
X
in
an
appropriate
fashion,
we
conclude
that
there
exists
a
normal,
Z-proper,
Z-ﬂat
scheme
Y
,
together
with
morphisms
φ
:
Y
→
X,
ψ
:
Y
→
P
such
that
φQ
is
an
isomorphism,
and
ψQ
=
Q
◦
φQ
.
Thus,
to
verify
assertion
(iv)
for
the
pair
(X,
L),
it
suﬃces
to
verify
assertion
(iv)
for
the
pair
(Y,
φ∗
L),
which,
by
assertion
(iii),
is
equivalent
to
assertion
(iv)
for
the
pair
(Y,
ψ
∗LP
),
where
we
write
LP
for
the
line
bundle
OP
(1)
equipped
with
the
standard
Fubini-Study
metric.
But
assertion
(iv)
for
the
pair
(Y,
ψ
∗
LP
)
follows
from
assertion
(iv)
for
the
pair
(P,
LP
).
Thus,
we
may
assume
that
(X,
L)
=
(P,
LP
).
Next,
observe
that
since
any
ﬁnite
set
of
points
of
a
ﬁber
of
P
→
Spec(Z)
is
contained
in
the
complement
of
a
hypersurface,
it
follows
immediately
that,
for
any
positive
integer
e
≤
d,
the
product
P
×
.
.
.
×
P
of
e
copies
of
P
[over
Z]
admits
a
[necessarily
normal,
Z-proper,
and
Z-ﬂat]
quotient
Q
by
the
action
of
the
symmetric
group
on
e
letters,
and
that
some
positive
tensor
power
of
the
tensor
product
of
the
pull-backs
of
LP
by
the
various
projections
P
×
.
.
.
×
P
→
P
descends
to
an
arithmetic
line
bundle
LQ
=
(LQ
,
|
−
|LQ
)
on
Q
such
that
(LQ
)Q
is
ample
on
QQ
.
Since
each
point
xP
∈
P
(F
)
for
F
such
that
[F
:
Q]
=
e
determines
[by
considering
the
various
Q-conjugates
of
xP
]
a
point
xQ
∈
Q(Q)
[which,
in
turn,
determines
xP
,
up
to
a
ﬁnite
number
of
possibilities],
we
thus
conclude
[by
varying
e]
that
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
the
set
of
points
of
y
∈
Q(Q)
such
that
htLQ
(y)
≤
C
is
ﬁnite.
Moreover,
by
embedding
Q
via
(LQ
)Q
into
some
projective
space
Z
=
Pm
Z
as
in
the
argument
of
the
preceding
paragraph,
we
thus
conclude
that
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
the
set
of
points
of
z
∈
Z(Q)
such
that
htLZ
(z)
≤
C
is
ﬁnite,
where
LZ
is
given
by
OZ
(1)
equipped
the
standard
Fubini-Study
metric.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
[as
is
easily
veriﬁed]
there
exists
a
unique
arithmetic
def
line
bundle
LS
on
S
=
Spec(Z),
up
to
isomorphism,
of
degree
[i.e.,
“degQ
”]
C;
moreover,
any
arithmetic
line
bundle
on
S
of
degree
≤
C
embeds
into
LS
.
In
particular,
by
applying
such
an
embedding,
we
conclude
that
given
any
point
z
∈
Z(Q)
=
Z(S)
such
that
htLZ
(z)
≤
C,
the
m
+
1
standard
generating
sections
of
LZ
restrict,
via
the
morphism
S
→
Z
determined
by
z,
to
sections
∈
Γ(LS
).
Since
[as
is
easily
veriﬁed]
Γ(LS
)
is
a
ﬁnite
set,
it
thus
follows
that
there
is
only
a
ﬁnite
number
of
possibilities
for
the
projective
coordinates
of
z.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iv).

Remark
1.4.1.
Observe
that
it
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions,
together
with
Proposition
1.4,
(iii),
that
the
theory
of
“BD-classes
of
height
functions
htL
(−)
on
X(Q)”
in
fact
depends
only
on
the
scheme
XQ
.
In
particular,
this
theory
may
be
applied
to
any
normal,
projective
scheme
Y
over
Q
[i.e.,
by
regarding
Y
as
the
“XQ
”
determined
by
some
Z-ﬂat,
Z-projective
model
“X”
of
Y
that
arises
from
a
projective
embedding
of
Y
].
Deﬁnition
1.5.
(i)
Note
if
x
∈
X(F
)
⊆
X(Q),
where
[F
:
Q]
<
∞,
then
by
considering
the
scheme-theoretic
image
of
the
corresponding
morphism
Spec(F
)
→
X,
one
obtains
a
well-deﬁned
minimal
ﬁeld
of
deﬁnition
Fmin
⊆
F
of
x.
In
particular,
it
makes
sense
to
say
that
F
“is
a
minimal
ﬁeld
of
deﬁnition
of
x”
[i.e.,
that
F
=
Fmin
].
(ii)
Let
E
⊆
Z
be
an
eﬀective
Cartier
divisor
contained
in
the
regular
locus
of
a
normal
noetherian
scheme
Z.
Then
observe
that
the
closed
subscheme
Ered
⊆
Z
is
also
an
eﬀective
Cartier
divisor.
We
shall
say
that
E
is
reduced
if
E
=
Ered
.
(iii)
Let
x
∈
X(F
)
⊆
X(Q),
where
F
is
a
minimal
ﬁeld
of
deﬁnition
of
x.
Then
the
diﬀerent
ideal
of
F
determines
an
eﬀective
arithmetic
divisor
δx
∈
ADiv(F
)
which
is
supported
in
V(F
)non
.
In
particular,
the
assignment
def
X(Q)

x
→
log-diﬀX
(x)
=
degF
(δx
)
∈
R
determines
a
well-deﬁned
log-diﬀerent
function
log-diﬀX
on
X(Q).
def
(iv)
Fix
an
eﬀective
Cartier
divisor
D
⊆
X;
write
UX
=
X\D.
Let
x
∈
UX
(F
)
⊆
UX
(Q),
where
F
is
a
minimal
ﬁeld
of
deﬁnition
of
x
[regarded
as
a
point
of
X(Q)].
Then
the
morphism
Spec(OF
)
→
X
determined
by
x
[where
we
recall
that
X
is
proper!]
allows
one
to
pull-back
the
divisor
D
to
Spec(OF
)
so
as
to
obtain
an
eﬀective
divisor
Dx
on
Spec(OF
).
Note
that
Dx
,
(Dx
)red
may
also
be
regarded
as
arithmetic
divisors
∈
ADiv(F
)
that
are
supported
in
V(F
)non
.
We
shall
refer
to
def
fD
x
=
(Dx
)red
∈
ADiv(F
)
as
the
conductor
of
x.
Thus,
the
assignment
def
X(Q)

x
→
log-condD
(x)
=
degF
(fD
x)∈R
determines
a
well-deﬁned
log-conductor
function
log-condD
on
UX
(Q)
⊆
X(Q).
Remark
1.5.1.
In
the
spirit
of
Remark
1.4.1,
we
observe
that
the
log-diﬀerent
function
log-diﬀX
on
X(Q)
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.5,
(iii)]
depends
only
on
the
scheme
XQ
.
On
the

immediately
that
the
BD-class
of
log-condD
on
UX
(Q)
depends
only
on
the
pair
of
Q-schemes
(XQ

Indeed,
this
follows
immediately
from
the
observation
that
if
(X
,

)
is
another
pair
[i.e.,
consisting
of
an

then

where
we
use
the
notation
“deg(−)”
to
denote
the
degree
of
a
line
bundle
on
YQ
or
ZQ
.
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
We
begin
by
observing
that
there
exists
a
ﬁnite
set
of
prime
numbers
Σ
such
that
the
restriction
of
Y
→
Z
to
the
spectrum
def
of
Z[Σ−1
]
=
Z[{p−1
}p∈Σ
]
is
a
ﬁnite
tamely
ramiﬁed
morphism
of
smooth,
proper
families
of
curves
over
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
Spec(Z[Σ−1
]).
In
particular,
the
“prime-to-Σ
portion”
of
the
inequality
“log-condE
−
log-condD
=
log-diﬀY
−
log-diﬀZ
≤
(1
−
e−1
)
·
log-condE
”
[i.e.,
with
“=”
and
“≤”,
not
“”!]
follows
immediately
from
the
elementary
theory
of
diﬀerents.
Note
that
the
“portion
over
Σ”
of
log-condE
,
log-condD
is
≈
0
[cf.
Remark
1.5.1],
while
[again
by
the
elementary
theory
of
diﬀerents]
the
“portion
over
Σ”
of
log-diﬀY
−
log-diﬀZ
is
≥
0
[i.e.,
with
“≥”,
not
“”!].
Thus,
to
complete
the
proof
of
assertion
(i),
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
the
“portion
over
Σ”
of
the
quantity
log-diﬀY
−
log-diﬀZ
is
bounded
in
UY
(Q).
Moreover,
by
working
locally,
we
reduce
immediately
to
the
following
elementary
claim:
Fix
a
prime
number
p
and
a
positive
integer
d.
Then
there
exists
a
positive
integer
n
such
that
for
any
ﬁnite
Galois
extension
L/K
of
ﬁnite
extensions
of
Qp
with
[L
:
K]
≤
d,
the
diﬀerent
ideal
of
L/K
contains
pn
·
OL
[where
we
write
OL
for
the
ring
of
integers
of
L].
To
verify
this
claim,
we
reason
as
follows:
By
separating
the
extension
L[ζ]/K,
where
ζ
is
a
primitive
p-th
root
of
unity,
into
a
composite
of
wildly
ramiﬁed
and
tamely
ramiﬁed
extensions
[and
observing
that
if
we
restrict
to
tamely
ramiﬁed
L/K,
then
it
suﬃces
to
take
n
=
1],
we
reduce
immediately
to
the
case
of
wildly
ramiﬁed
L/K
such
that
K
contains
a
primitive
p-th
root
of
unity
ζ.
Moreover,
since
Gal(L/K)
is
a
[necessarily
solvable!]
p-group
of
order
≤
d,
it
suﬃces
to
consider
the
case
where
[L
:
K]
=
p.
Since
ζ
∈
K,
it
follows
immediately
from
def
elementary
Kummer
theory
that
L
=
K(λ)
for
some
λ
∈
L
such
that
κ
=
λp
∈
K.
Moreover,
by
multiplying
κ
by
an
element
of
(K
×
)p
,
we
may
assume
that
κ
is
a
a
unit
multiple
of
πK
,
where
πK
is
a
uniformizer
of
K
and
a
is
a
nonnegative
integer
<
p.
In
particular,
it
follows
that
κ
∈
OK
,
but
κ
∈
/
pp
·
OK
,
hence
that
OL
⊇
λ
·
OL
⊇
p
·
OL
.
On
the
other
hand,
since
in
this
case,
we
have
an
inclusion
of
OK
-algebras
OK
[X]/(X
p
−
κ)
→
OL
,
one
computes
easily
that
the
diﬀerent
ideal
of
L/K
contains
p
·
λp−1
·
OL
⊇
p1+(p−1)
·
OL
=
pp
·
OL
.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
claim,
and
hence
of
assertion
(i).
Assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
the
Riemann-Hurwitz
formula
for
ramiﬁed
coverings
of
smooth,
proper
curves.

Theorem
2.1.
(Compactly

the
ABC
Conjecture)
Let
Σ
be
a
ﬁnite
set
of
prime
numbers.
Then
in
the
terminology
of
§1
[cf.,
especially,
Deﬁnitions
1.2,

the
following
two
statements
are
equivalent:

Let

smooth,
proper,

a

Write
ωX
for
the
canonical

on
X.
Suppose
that
UX
is
a
hyperbolic
curve
—
i.e.,
that
the
degree
of
the
line
bundle
ωX
(D)
is
positive.
Then
the
inequality
of
BD-classes
of
functions
htωX
(D)

(1
+
)(log-diﬀX
+
log-condD
)
holds
on
UX
(Q)≤d
.

Let
P
=

be
the
projective

over

the

consisting
of

[i.e.,

—
cf.

whose
support
contains

Write
ωP
for

on

.
Then
the
inequality
of


(1

Proof.
The
fact
that
(i)
=⇒
(ii)
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions.
Thus,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
(ii)
=⇒
(i).
Let
X,
D,
UX
,
d,

be
as
in
(i).
Now
it
follows
immediately
from
the
well-known
structure
of
étale
fundamental
groups
of
hyperbolic
curves
over
algebraically
closed
ﬁelds
of
characteristic
zero
that
for
any

there

such

in

and
E

,
then
Y
is
a
hyperbolic
curve,
and,
moreover,
Y
→

is
ramiﬁed
at
each
point
of
E
with
ramiﬁcation

equal

Here,

satisﬁed
for

Then
by

by

assume
that

deg(ωY

But,
by

this
implies
that

Since
every

(Q)≤d
clearly
lifts
to
a
point
of
UY
(Q)≤d
,
this
completes
the
veriﬁcation
of
the
claim.
Thus,
in
summary,
to
complete
the
proof
of
Theorem
2.1,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that

implies
(i)
for

as
in

To

let
us
suppose
that
the
inequality
htωX

false

Let

that
contains

[the

Then
it

immediately
from

false
on

the

of
Q-conjugates
of
points

Ξ
converge,
as
[unordered]
d-tuples
of

to

Moreover,
by
the
main
result
of

[cf.

there
exists
a

Section
3:
Full
Special
Linear
Galois
Actions
on
Torsion
Points
In
the
present
§3,
we
give
various
conditions
on
a
prime
l
that
ensure
that
the
image
of
the
Galois
representation
on
the
l-power
torsion
points
of
an
elliptic
curve
over
a
number
ﬁeld
is
“rather
large”
[cf.
Theorem
3.8].
In
particular,
we
show
that
if
one
considers
elliptic
curves
over
number
ﬁelds
of
bounded
degree
that
have
at
least
one
[nonarchimedean]
prime
of
potentially
[bad]
multiplicative
reduction,
then,
if
one
excludes
ﬁnitely
many
exceptional
elliptic
curves,
it
holds
that
for
any
prime
number
l
of
the
order
of
the
height
of
the
elliptic
curve,
the
image
of
the
associated
Galois
representation
in
GL2
(Zl
)
contains
SL2
(Zl
).
Here,
the
condition
of
having
at
least
one
prime
of
potentially
multiplicative
reduction
holds
automatically,
with
ﬁnitely
many
exceptions,
if
one
restricts
oneself
to
elliptic
curves
arising
from
points
of
the
moduli
stack
of
elliptic
curves
that
are
contained
in
some
compactly
bounded
subset
of
the
set
of
all
points.
In
particular,
for
such
a
prime
number
l,
the
elliptic
curve
will
not
have
any
rational
torsion
points
of
order
l.
Thus,
this
result
may
be
regarded
as
a
sort
of
“poor
man’s
uniform
boundedness
conjecture”
—
now
Merel’s
theorem
[cf.
[Merel]]
–
although,
in
fact,
it
is
not
strictly
implied
by
Merel’s
theorem.
Alternatively,
it
may
be
regarded
as
an
eﬀective
version
of
a
theorem
of
Serre
[cf.
[Serre],
Chapter
IV,
Theorem
3.2].
The
proof
is
similar
to
that
of
Faltings’
proof
of
the
Tate
Conjecture
[cf.
[Falt]],
only
technically
much
simpler.
That
is
to
say,
the
main
technique
is
essentially
the
standard
one,
going
back
to
Tate,
for
proving
“Tate
conjecture-type
results”.
We
begin
by
reviewing
various
well-known
facts
concerning
the
structure
of
SL2
(Fl

SL2
(Zl
),
for
l
a

number
≥

be

Then:

generated
by
the
matrices
α
=
def
β
=
1
1
0
1
,
1
0
1
1
.
Then
G
=
SL2
(Fl
).

The
ﬁnite
group
SL2
(Fl

has
no
nontrivial
abelian
quotients.
def
(iii)
Let
H
⊆
GL2
(Fl
)
be
a
subgroup
that
contains
the
matrix
α
=
10
11
,
as
well
as
at
least
one
matrix
that
is
not
upper
triangular.
Then
SL2
(Fl
)
⊆
H.
(iv)
Let
J
⊆

be
a
closed
subgroup
whose
image
HJ
in
GL2
(Fl

contains
def
the
matrix
α
=

11
,
as
well
as
a
matrix
which
is
not
upper
triangular.
Then
SL2
(Zl
)
⊆
J.
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
Note
that
if
μ,
λ
∈
Fl
,
then
β
μ
·
αλ
[where
we
observe
that
this
expression
makes
sense
since
both
αl
and
β
l
are
equal
to
the
def
def
λ
identity
matrix]
takes
the
vector
v
=
01
to
μ·λ+1
.
Thus,
if
we
let
γ
=
01
10
,
then
λ
for
any
λ
∈
F×
l
,
there
exists
a
gλ
∈
G
such
that
λ
·
γ
·
v
=
0
=
gλ
·
v.
In
particular,
we
have
λ
·
g1
·
v
=
λ
·
γ
·
v
=
gλ
·
v,
so
λ
·
v
∈
G
·
v.
Thus,
in
summary,
we
have
proven
that
(Fl
×
Fl
)
−
{
00
}
⊆
G
·
v.
Now
let
us
prove
that
an
arbitrary
element
δ
∈
SL2
(Fl
)
is
contained
in
G.
By
the
conclusion
of
the
above
argument,
we
may
assume
that
δ
·
v
=
v.
But
this
implies
that
δ
is
a
lower
triangular
matrix
all
of
whose
diagonal
entries
are
equal
to
1.
Thus,
δ
is
a
power
of
β,
hence
contained
in
G,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
2
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
Let
λ
∈
F×
l
be
such
that
λ
=
1.
[Note
that
def
2
such
a
λ
exists
since
l
≥
5.]
Let

=
λ0
λ0−1
.
Then

·
α
·
−1
·
α−1
=
αλ
−1
.
Thus,
α
(and,
similarly,
β)
is
contained
in
the
commutator
subgroup
of
SL2
(Fl
),
so
assertion
(ii)
follows
from
assertion
(i).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
Note
that
α
generates
an
l-Sylow
subgroup
S
of
GL2
(Fl
),
and
that
the
number
of
l-Sylow
subgroups
of
GL2
(Fl
)
is
precisely
l
+
1.
Since
the
normalizer
of
S
in
GL2
(Fl
)
is
the
set
of
upper
triangular
matrices,
and
we
have
assumed
that
H
contains
at
least
one
non-upper
triangular
matrix,
it
follows
that
the
number
nH
of
l-Sylow
subgroups
of
H
is
≥
2.
On
the
other
hand,
by
the
general
theory
of
Sylow
subgroups,
it
follows
that
nH
is
congruent
to
1
modulo
l.
Since
2
≤
nH
≤
l
+
1,
we
thus
obtain
that
nH
=
l
+
1.
In
particular,
in
the
notation
of
assertion
(i),
we
conclude
that
α,
β
∈
H.
Thus,
by
assertion
(i),
we
have
SL2
(Fl
)
⊆
H,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii).
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iv).
By
assertion
(iii),
we
have
that
SL2
(Fl
)
⊆
HJ
.
Let
J
⊆
SL2
(Zl
)
be
the
closure
of
the
commutator
subgroup
of
J.
Thus,
by
assertion
(ii),
J
surjects
onto
SL2
(Fl
).
Now
by
[Serre],
Chapter
IV,
§3.4,
Lemma
3,
this
implies
that
SL2
(Zl
)
=
J
⊆
J,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iv).

Next,
we
consider
the
local
theory
at
nonarchimedean
primes.
Let
K
be
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
[where
p
is
a
prime
number]
with
residue
ﬁeld
k,
maximal
ideal
mK
⊆
OK
,
and
valuation
map
vK
:
K

→
Z
[which
we
normalize
so
that

def
is
surjective];
K
an
algebraic
closure
of
K;
GK
=
Gal(K/K);
E
→
Spec(OK
)
a
one-dimensional
semi-abelian
scheme
over
OK
such
that
the
generic
ﬁber
EK
of
E
is
proper,
while
the
special
ﬁber
Ek
of
E
is
isomorphic
to
(Gm
)k
,
the
multiplicative
group
over
k.
Let
l
be
a
prime
number
[possibly
equal
to
p];
write
def
Ml
(E)
=
Hom(Z/l
·
Z,
E(K))
for
the
“mod
l”
Tate
module
of
EK
.
Thus,
Ml
(E)
is
[noncanonically!]
isomorphic
as
an
Fl
-module
to
Fl
×
Fl
,
and,
moreover,
is
equipped
with
a
continuous
action
by
GK
[induced
by
the
natural
action
of
GK
on
K].
Also,
it
is
well-known
[cf.,
e.g.,
[FC],
Chapter
III,
Corollary
7.3]
that
Ml
(E)
ﬁts
into
a
natural
exact
sequence
of
GK
-modules
0
→
Fl
(1)
→
Ml
(E)
→
Fl
→
0
—
where
the
“(1)”
is
a
Tate
twist,
and
“Fl
”
is
equipped
with
the
trivial
Galois
action.
Moreover,
the
extension
class
associated
to
this
exact
sequence
is
precisely
that
obtained
by
extracting
an
l-th
root
of
the
Tate
parameter
qE
∈
mK
.
The
Tate
parameter
is
an
element
of
mK
that
is
naturally
associated
to
E
and
has
the
property
that
the
subscheme
OK
/(qE
)
is
equal
to
the
pull-back
via
the
classifying
morphism
Spec(OK

→
Mell
—
where
we
write
Mell
for
the
moduli
stack
of
onedimensional
semi-abelian
varieties
over
Z
—
of
the
divisor
at
inﬁnity
∞M
⊆
Mell
.
Thus,
the
above
exact
sequence
splits
if
and
only
if
qE
has
an
l-th
root
in
K.
Note
that
in
order
for
this
to
happen,
it
is
necessary
that
vK
(qE
)
be
divisible
by
l.
In
particular,
we
have
the
following
well-known
result.
Lemma

Let
N

Ml

be
a

which
is
stabilized
by
GK

Then
either

is
equal

the
submodule
Fl

ﬂat
subgroup
scheme
μl
⊆
E
over
OK
,
whose
quotient
we
denote
by
E
=
E/μl
.
[Thus,
E
→
Spec(OK

is
a
one-dimensional
semi-abelian
scheme
over
OK
whose
generic
ﬁber
is
proper,
and
whose
special

is
isomorphic
to
(Gm

.]
The
Tate
l

qE

of
E
satisﬁes
the
relation
qE

in
particular,
we

where
we
write
deg∞

=

∈
R.
Deﬁnition
3.3.
We
shall
refer
to
the
positive
integer
vK
(qE
)
∈
Z>0
as
the
local
height
of
E
[or
EK
].
16
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
Remark
3.3.1.
Note
that
even
if
EK
only
has
potentially
multiplicative
reduction,
one
may
deﬁne
the
local
height
of
EK
as
the
element
∈
Q
computed
by
dividing
the
local
height
of
EK
×K
L
for
some
ﬁnite
extension
L
of
K
over
which
EK
has
multiplicative
reduction
by
the
ramiﬁcation
index
of
L/K
[so
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
this
deﬁnition
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
L].
Next,
let
F
⊆
Q
be
a
number
ﬁeld,
E
→
Spec(OF
)
a
one-dimensional
semiabelian
variety
whose
generic
ﬁber
EF
is
proper.
Also,
for
simplicity,
we
assume
that
F
is
totally
imaginary.
Thus,
EF
is
an
elliptic
curve
over
F
.
Let
us
write
ωE
for
the
ﬁnite,
ﬂat
OF
-module
of
rank
one
consisting
of
the
invariant
diﬀerentials
def
on
E.
If
v
∈
V(F
)arc
,
then
we
get
a
natural
metric
on
(ωE
)v
=
(ωE
)
⊗F
Fv
by
integration:
if
α
∈
(ωE
)v
,
then
def
α∧α
|α|2
=
Ev
def
—
where
Ev
=
E
×F
Fv
,
and
α
is
the
complex
conjugate
of
α.
Thus,
by
equipping
ωE
with
this
metric
at
the
archimedean
places
of
F
,
we
obtain
an
arithmetic
line
bundle
ω
E
on
Spec(OF
).
Let
us
write
def
htFalt
(E)
=
degF
(ω
E
)
∈
R
for
the
so-called
Faltings
height
of
the
elliptic
curve
E.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
E
→
Spec(OF
)
deﬁnes
a
classifying
morphism
φ
:
Spec(OF
)
→
Mell
—
where
we
write
Mell
for
the
moduli
stack
of
one-dimensional
semi-abelian
varieties
over
Z.
As
is
well-known,
this
stack
has
a
“divisor
at
inﬁnity”
∞M
⊆
Mell
,
whose
complement
Mell
⊆
Mell
is
the
moduli
stack
of
elliptic
curves
over
Z.
Set
def
deg∞
(E)
=
degF
(∞E
)
∈
R
def
—
where
we
write
∞E
=
φ−1
(∞M
)
⊆
Spec(OF
).
Although
the
algebraic
stack
Mell
is
not
a
scheme,
it
is
nevertheless
normal,
Z-proper,
and
Z-ﬂat.
Thus,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
the
theory
of
§1
extends
immediately
to
the
case
of
Mell
;
in
particular,
one
may
consider
functions
on
subsets
of
Mell
(Q),
BD-classes
of
such
functions,
and
height
functions
on
Mell
(Q)
associated
to
arithmetic
line
bundles
on
Mell
.
Write
ht∞
for
the
BD-class
of
height
functions
determined
by
the
line
bundle
OMell
(∞M
).
Also,
we
observe
that
if
we
write
[E]
∈
Mell
(Q)
for
the
isomorphism
class
deterdef
def
mined
by
E,
then
we
may
regard
[E]
→
htFalt
([E])
=
htFalt
(E),
[E]
→
deg∞
([E])
=
deg∞
(E)
as
functions
on
Mell
(Q).
Now
we
have
the
following
well-known
result.

The

immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions
[cf.

The
remaining

the

of

Proposition

Finally,
the
ﬁniteness

immediately
from
the

Proposition

Lemma
3.5.
(Global
Rank
One
Subgroups
of
l-Torsion)
Let

∈
R>0
;
l
a
prime
number;
HF
⊆
EF
a
subgroup
scheme
such
that
HF
×F
Q
is
isomorphic
to
the
constant
group
scheme
determined
by
Z/l
·
Z.
We
shall
call
such
a
subgroup
def
scheme
HF
l-cyclic.
Write
(EH
)F
=
EF
/HF
.
[Thus,
(EH
)F
is
isogenous
to
EF
,
hence
has
semi-stable
reduction
at
all
the
ﬁnite
primes
of
F
and
extends
to
a
one-dimensional
semi-abelian
scheme
EH
→
Spec(OF
).]
Suppose
further
that
l
is
prime
to
the
local
heights
of
E
at
all
of
its
primes
of
[bad]
multiplicative
reduction
[a
condition
that
is
satisﬁed,
for
instance,
if
l
is
>
these
local
heights].
Then
we
have
1
l
·
deg∞
(E)
≤
htFalt
(E)
+
2
log(l)
+
C
12(1

for
some
constant
C
∈
R
which
[may
depend
on

but]
is
independent
of
E,
F
,
HF
,
and
l.
Proof.
Note
that
the
assumption
on
l
implies,
by
Lemma
3.2,
(i),
that
at
all
the
primes
of
multiplicative
reduction,
HF
corresponds
to
the
subspace
Fl
(1)
of
Lemma
3.2,
(i).
Thus,
at
primes
of
multiplicative
reduction,
EH
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
elliptic
curve
“E
”
of
Lemma
3.2,
(ii).
In
particular,
it
follows
that
deg∞
(EH
)
=
l
·
deg∞
(E).
On
the
other
hand,
the
degree
l
covering
morphism
EF
→
(EH
)F
extends
[cf.,
e.g.,
[FC],
Chapter
I,
Proposition
2.7]
to
a
morphism
E
→
EH
.
Thus,
we
have
a
natural
inclusion
ωEH
⊆
ωE
whose
cokernel
is
annihilated
by
l.
Moreover,
since
integrating
a
(1,
1)-form
over
Ev
diﬀers
from
integrating
over
(EH
)v
by
a
factor
of
l,
we
conclude
that
htFalt
(EH
)
=
deg(ω
EH
)
≤
deg(ω
E
)+2·log(l)
=
htFalt
(E)+2·log(l).
Thus,
Lemma

follows
from
Proposition
3.4.

Before

that
satisfy
the

l

Consider
the

two
conditions
on

data:
(a)
l

and
EL
has
at

(b)

and
l
is
prime
to
the
local
heights
of
EL
at
all
of
its
primes
of
multiplicative
reduction.
Then
if
(a)
is
satisﬁed,
then
l
is
>
the
local
heights
of
EL
at
all
the
primes
of
multiplicative

If
(b)
is
satisﬁed,
and
[EL

∈
Exc,
then
EL
has
at
least
one
prime
of
multiplicative

If
either
(a)
or
(b)
is
satisﬁed,
and,
moreover,
EL
admits
an
l-cyclic
subgroup
scheme
HL
⊆
EL
,
then
[EL
]
∈
Exc.
Proof.
First,
observe
that
if
v
is
any
local
height
of
EL
,
then
d
·
deg∞
([EL

≥
v
·
log(2).
Next,
let
us
observe
that
by
Proposition
3.4,
for
an
appropriate
choice
of

C,
we
may
assume
that

[i.e.,
where
we
take
“12(1

to
be

Thus,
condition
(a)
implies
that
l

deg∞

—
i.e.,
that
l
is
>
the
local
heights
of
EL
at
all
the
primes
of
multiplicative
reduction.
On
the
other
hand,
if
condition
(b)
is
satisﬁed,
and,
moreover
EL
has
no
primes
of
multiplicative
reduction
[so
deg∞
([EL

=
0],
then
the
fact
that
[EL
]
∈
KV
implies
that
ht∞
([EL

is
bounded
[independently
of
L,
EL
,
l],
so,
by
Proposition
to
some
[ﬁxed]
ﬁnite
exceptional

[which
we
think
of
1.4,


[EL

as

For
the
remainder
of
the
present
proof,
let
us
assume
that
either
(a)
or
(b)
is
satisﬁed
[so
l
is
prime
to
the

and
that
EL
admits
an
l-cyclic

Thus,
by

we
conclude
that

Now
suppose
that
condition
(a)
is
satisﬁed.
Let
C0
be
as
in
Lemma
3.6.
Then
let
us
observe
that
if
we
choose

suﬃciently
large
[cf.

that

then
by
Lemma
3.6
[where
inequality
of
condition
(a)
implies
that
l

log(2)

],
we
conclude
that
l
≥
56d·log(l)
we
take
“x”

Now
since
EL

at

it
follows
that

deg∞

Thus,
substituting
into
(‡),
2
≤
htFalt

On

log(2)

we
obtain

C

i.e.,
that

But
this
implies,
by

that

computed
as

an

in

since
[EL

In
particular,
by
modifying
C

in
a
fashion
that
depends
on

—
and
applying
Proposition

we
may
assume
that
deg∞
([EL

≥
ht∞

−
C
≥

htFalt
([EL

−

Thus,
by
substituting

perhaps
modifying

again],
we
obtain
that
l
l

htFalt

C

i.e.,
[since

Let

such

that

Proof.
First,
let
us
observe
that
for
an
EL
as
in
the
statement
of
Theorem
3.8,
def
there
exists
a
Galois
extension
L
of
L
of
degree
that
divides
d0
=
(32
−
1)(32
−
3)(52
−1)(52
−5)
=
23040
[i.e.,
the
order
of
GL2
(F3
)×GL2
(F5
)],
so
as
to
render
the
3-
and
5-torsion
points
of
EL
rational
over
L
[which
has
the
eﬀect
of
eliminating
def
automorphisms
of
elliptic
curves
in
all
characteristics],
we
may
assume
that
EL
=
EL
×L
L
has
semi-stable
reduction
at
all
of
the
ﬁnite
primes
of
L.
[Here,
we
note
that
passing
to
such
a
Galois
extension
of
L
only
aﬀects
the
prime
decomposition
of
the
local
heights
via
the
primes
that
divide
d0
,
of
which
there
are
only
ﬁnitely
many,
namely,
2,
3,
and
5.]
Next,
let
us
observe
that
for
a
suitable
choice
of
C
∈
R>0
and
Exc
⊆
Mell
(Q),
if
EL
and
l
satisfy
condition
(a)
(respectively,
(b))
of
the
statement
of
Theorem
3.8,
then
EL
and
l
satisfy
condition
(a)
(respectively,
(b))
of
Lemma
3.7
[perhaps
for
a
diﬀerent
“C”].
Thus,
[cf.
the
portion
of
Lemma
3.7
that
asserts
that
“l
is
>
the
local
heights”]
for
EL
,
l
as
in
the
statement
of
Theorem
3.8,
the
local
height
of
EL
at
a
ﬁnite
prime
of
L
of
multiplicative
reduction
is
not
divisible
by
l.
Note,
moreover,
that
at
least
one
such
ﬁnite
prime
exists
[cf.
the
content
of
condition
(a);
Lemma
3.7
in
the
case
of
condition
(b)].
Thus,
it
follows
from
the
discussion
of
the
local
theory
preceding
Lemma
3.2
that
the
image
of
Galois
in
GL2
(Fl
)
contains
the
element
“α”
of
Lemma
3.1,
(iv),
i.e.,
10
11
.
On
the
other
hand,
by
the
portion
of
Lemma
3.7
concerning
l-cyclic
subgroup
schemes,
it
follows
that
the
image
of
Galois
in
GL2
(Fl
)
contains
at
least
one
matrix
which
is
not
upper
triangular.
Thus,
we
conclude
from
Lemma
3.1,
(iv),
that
the
image
of
Galois
in
GL2
(Zl
)
contains
SL2
(Zl
),
as
desired.

In

§4,
we
combine
the
full

result
given
in

some
classical

to
give
versions
of

the
property
of
being
distinct
from
various

that
are,
in
some

“characteristic”

consideration.
We
begin
by
reviewing
the
following
result
in
classical

number
theory.
Lemma

(The

Then
for

Proof.
Indeed,
write
δ
=

yA
=
(1

·
xA
+
8h,
and
suppose
that
the
conclusion
of
Lemma
4.1
is
false.
Then
it
follows
that
there
exists
an
oﬀending
ﬁnite
set
of
primes
A
such
that
xA

x

and,
moreover,
all
prime

p
such
that
h
≤
p
≤
yA
belong
—
with
M
−

possible

—
to

But
then
it
follows
from

deﬁnitions
that
xA

log(yA

Thus,

compute:

entirely
elementary.
On

with
regard
to

the
fact
that

is
a
well-known
consequence
of
the
prime
number
theorem
of
classical

Let
Q

Then
there
exists

Write

Proof.
First,
let
us
observe
that
if
EL
is
as
in
the
statement
of
Corollary
4.3,
and
l
is
any
prime
number
that
is
unramiﬁed
in

then
the
image
of
the
Galois
representation
Gal(Q/L)
→
GL2
(Zl

associated

contains
SL2
(Zl
)
if
and
only
if
the
Galois
representation
Gal(Q/L)
→
GL2
(Zl
)
is
surjective.
[Indeed,
this
follows
immediately
from
the
well-known
fact
that
the
ﬁeld
extension
Q(ζl∞
)/Q
obtained
by
adjoining
the
l-th
power
roots
of
unity
to
Q
is
totally
ramiﬁed
over
the
prime
l,
hence
linearly
disjoint
from
the
extension
L/Q.]
Thus,
by
applying
Theorem
3.8
—
relative
to
condition
(a)
of
Theorem
3.8
—
we
conclude
that
to
complete
the
proof
of
Corollary
4.3,
it
suﬃces
to
show
the
existence
of
prime
numbers
l◦

l•
that
satisfy
the
conditions
(a),
(c),
and,
moreover,
are

C
·
d
),
where
C
∈
R>0
is
a
constant
[i.e.,
the
“C”
of
Theorem
3.8].
Now
let
us
write
S◦
for
the
union
of
S,
the
primes
of
Q
that
lie
under
primes
of
potentially
multiplicative
reduction
of
EL
,
and
the
primes
that
appear
in
the
prime
decomposition
of
the
local

write
S•
for
the
union
of

the

of
Q
that
ramify
in
L,
and
the
primes
that
divide
the
ramiﬁcation
indices
of

Thus,
[in

we
conclude

In

vein,

[as
is
easily
veriﬁed,

considering

trace
of
an
extension
of

ﬁelds]
the

a

set
of
prime
numbers.
Write
d
=
[L

xS
=
p∈S
log(p).
Then
there
exist
prime
numbers
l◦

l•

S
which
satisfy
the
following
conditions:
(a)
l◦
,
l•
are
prime
to
the
primes
of
potentially
multiplicative
reduction,
as
well
as
to
the
local
heights,
of
EL
.
Moreover,
l•
is
prime
to
the
primes
of
Q
that
ramify
in
L,
as
well
as
to
the
ramiﬁcation
indices
of
primes
of
Q
in
L.

The
image
of
the
Galois
representation
Gal(Q/L)

associated
to
EL
contains
SL2
(Zl◦

The
Galois
representation
Gal(Q/L)

EL

surjective.

Proof.
The
proof
is
entirely
similar
to
[but
slightly
easier
than]
the
proof
of
Corollary
4.3,
except
that
instead
of
applying
condition
(a)
of
Theorem
3.8,
we
apply
condition
(b)
of
Theorem
3.8.
Also,
when
applying
Lemma
4.1,
we
take
“h”
to
be
0.

Remark
4.4.1.
Typically,
in
computations
of
arithmetic
degrees,
such
as
heights
[i.e.,
“htFalt
(−)”,
etc.],
the
terms
that
appear
in
a
sum
that
computes
the
arithmetic
degree
are
not
terms
that
are
“polynomial
in
l”,
but
rather
terms
that
are
linear
in
log(l).
Thus,
in
the
context
of
Corollaries
4.3,
4.4,
if
l
is
equal
to
l◦
or
l•
,
then
log(l)
is
of
the
order
of
log(htFalt
(−))
+
(1
+
)log(d)
or
log(htFalt
(−))
+
log(log-diﬀMell
(−))
+
(1
+
)log(d)
—
hence
asymptotically
bounded
by

·
(htFalt
(−)
+
d)
or

·
(htFalt
(−)
+
log-diﬀMell
(−)
+
d)
—
for

>
0.
Remark
4.4.2.
Let
UP
⊆
P
be
as
in
Theorem
2.1,
(ii).
Thus,
by
regarding
UP
as
the
“λ-line”
[i.e.,
regarding
the
standard
coordinate
on
P
as
the
“λ”
in
the
Legendre
form
“y
2
=
x(x
−
1)(x
−
λ)”
of
the
Weierstrass
equation
deﬁning
an
elliptic
curve],
one
obtains
a
natural
ﬁnite
étale
[classifying]
morphism
UP
→
Mell
×Z
Q.
Then
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
[relative
to
the
elliptic
curves
obtained
from
points
∈
UP
(Q)
via
this
classifying
morphism]
one
obtains
a
result
entirely
similar
to
Corollary
4.4
by
replacing
“Mell
⊆
Mell
”
by
UP
⊆
P
.
In
particular,
in
the
context
of
Theorem
2.1,
(ii),
one
may
always
assume
the
existence
of
prime
numbers
l◦
,
l•
as
in
[this
UP
⊆
P
version
of]
Corollary
4.4.
