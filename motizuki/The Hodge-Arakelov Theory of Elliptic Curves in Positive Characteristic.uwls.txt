Introduction
The
purpose
of
this
paper
is
to
study
the
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
of
elliptic
curves
(cf.
[Mzk1-4])
in
positive
characteristic.
The
ﬁrst
two
§’s
(§1,2)
are
devoted
to
studying
the
relationship
of
the
Frobenius
and
Verschiebung
morphisms
of
an
elliptic
curve
in
positive
characteristic
to
the
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
of
elliptic
curves.
We
begin
by
deriving
a
“Verschiebung-Theoretic
Analogue
of
the
HodgeArakelov
Comparison
Isomorphism”
(Theorem
1.1)
which
underlies
our
analysis
in
§1,2.
From
this
result,
we
derive,
in
particular,
an
explicit
description
of
the
étale
integral
structure
of
an
elliptic
curve
in
positive
characteristic
(Corollary
1.3).
This
result
may
be
regarded
as
a
characteristic
p
version
of
[Mzk3],
Theorem
2.2,
which
(unlike
loc.
cit.,
which
holds
only
for
ordinary
elliptic
curves)
is
valid
even
for
supersingular
elliptic
curves.
Next,
in
§2,
we
apply
the
theory
of
§1
to
obtain
a
new
proof
using
positive
characteristic
methods
(Theorem
2.3)
of
the
scheme-theoretic
portion
of
the
Hodge-Arakelov
Comparison
Isomorphism
of
[Mzk1].
In
some
sense,
this
new
proof
is
more
elegant
than
the
proof
of
[Mzk1],
which
involves
the
veriﬁcation
of
various
complicated
combinatorial
identities
(cf.
the
Remarks
following
Theorem
2.3).
This
situation
is
rather
reminiscent
of
the
computation
of
the
degree
of
the
hyperbolically
ordinary
locus
in
p-adic
Teichmüller
theory
([Mzk5],
Chapter
V
—
cf.,
especially,
the
second
Remark
following
Corollary
1.3).
Indeed,
in
that
case,
as
well,
characteristic
p
methods
(involving
Frobenius
and
Verschiebung)
give
rise
to
various
nontrivial
combinatorial
identities.
It
would
be
interesting
if
this
sort
of
Typeset
by
AMS-TEX

2
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
phenomenon
could
be
understood
more
clearly
at
a
conceptual
level.
Another
interesting
feature
of
the
proof
of
Theorem
2.3
is
the
crucial
use
of
a
certain
subgroup
scheme
of
an
elliptic
curve
in
positive
characteristic
which
may
be
regarded
as
an
analogue
of
the
“global
multiplicative
subspace”
of
[Mzk4],
§3.
That
is
to
say,
the
crucial
role
of
this
subgroup
scheme
is
reminiscent
of
the
observation
(cf.
[Mzk4],
§3,4)
that
such
a
global
multiplicative
subspace
in
the
context
of
elliptic
curves
over
number
ﬁelds
seems
to
be
crucial
to
the
application
of
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
to
diophantine
geometry.
Also,
we
remark
that
in
the
course
of
proving
Theorem
2.3,
we
correct
several
misprints
(cf.
the
Remark
immediately
following
the
proof
of
Proposition
2.2)
in
[Mzk3].
Finally,
in
§3,
we
work
out
the
theory
of
[Mzk4],
§2,
in
the
case
of
p
=
2.
In
loc.
cit.,
this
theory
was
only
worked
out
in
the
case
of
odd
p
(for
the
sake
of
simplicity).
The
case
of
p
=
2
involves
dealing
with
various
technical
complications
modulo
2.
Unlike
the
case
of
odd
p,
where
the
theory
of
[Mzk4],
§2,
allows
one
to
relate
the
Lagrangian
arithmetic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
to
the
usual
geometric
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
of
a
family
of
elliptic
curves,
in
the
case
of
p
=
2,
one
obtains
the
result
(Corollary
3.7)
that
the
Lagrangian
arithmetic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
is
naturally
related
to
the
usual
geometric
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
of
the
ample
line
bundle
under
consideration.
Notation

log
We
will
denote
by
(Mell
)Z
the
log
moduli
stack
of
log
elliptic
curves
over
Z
(cf.
[Mzk1],
Chapter
III,
Deﬁnition
1.1),
where
the
log
structure
is
that
deﬁned
by
the
divisor
at
inﬁnity.
(In
[Mzk1-4],
Mell
was
denoted
by
“M1,0
.”
This
change
of

was
adopted
in
response
to
the

voiced
by
a

with

The
Verschiebung
Morphism
in
Positive
Characteristic
Fix
a
prime
number
p.
Let
S
log
be
a
ﬁne
noetherian
log
scheme
over
Fp
,
and
C
log
→
S
log
a
log
elliptic
curve
(cf.
[Mzk1],
Chapter
III,
Deﬁnition
1.1)
over
S
log
.
Write
D
⊆
S
for
the
pull-back
to
S
of
the
divisor
at
inﬁnity
of
the
moduli
stack
of
log
elliptic
curves,
and
E
⊆
C
for
the
one-dimensional
semi-abelian
scheme
which
forms
an
open
subscheme
of
the
semi-stable
compactiﬁcation
C.
Also,
let
us
assume
that
D
⊆
S
forms
a
Cartier
divisor
in
S,
and
that
on
the
open
dense
subscheme
POSITIVE
CHARACTERISTIC
3
def
US
=
S\D
⊆
S
of
S,
the
log
structure
of
S
log
is
trivial.
Since
S
is
an
Fp
-scheme,
it
is
equipped
with
a
Frobenius
morphism
ΦS
:
S
→
S
If
n
is
a
nonnegative
integer,
then
we
shall
denote
the
result
of
base-change
with
respect
to
the
n-th
power
of
ΦS
by
means
of
a
superscript
F
n
.
Note
that
the
n-th
power
of
the
Verschiebung
morphism
n
VEn
:
E
F
→
E
for
the
group
scheme
E
→
S
extends
uniquely
to
a
morphism
VGn
:
Gn
→
C
satisfying
the
properties:
(i)
VGn
|US
=
VEn
|US
;
(ii)
in
a
neighborhood
of
the
divisor
at
inﬁnity
D,
VGn
is
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
degree
pn
.
If
the
q-parameter
of
the
log
elliptic
curve
C
log
→
S
log
admits
a
pn
-th
root
at
all
points
of
D,
then
let
us
write
Hn
→
S
for
the
semi-stable
genus
1
curve
over
S
which
is
equal
to
E
→
S
over
US
,
and,
near
D,
is
the
unique
minimal
semi-stable
model
of
E|US
for
which
the
closure
of
the
pn
-torsion
points
of
E|US
lie
in
the
smooth
locus
of
Hn
→
S.
Then
the
morphism
[pn
]E
:
E
→
E
given
by
multiplication
by
pn
extends
to
a
morphism
[pn
]H
:
Hn
→
C
which
factors
Φn
Vn
H
G
Hn
−→
Gn
−→
C
Moreover,
this
ﬁrst
morphism
ΦnH
:
Hn
→
Gn
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
n-th
n
iterate
of
the
relative
(over
S)
Frobenius
morphism
Hn
→
HnF
of
Hn
.
Thus,
in
n
particular,
Gn
may
be
identiﬁed
with
HnF
.
Also,
over
US
,
this
factorization
is
the
usual
factorization
of
[pn
]E
:
E
→
E
as
the
composite
of
the
n-th
iterate
of
Frobenius
with
the
n-th
iterate
of
the
Verschiebung
morphism.
Next,
let
us
recall
the
universal
extension
of
E
4
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
E†
→
E
(cf.
[Mzk1],
Chapter
III,
Deﬁnition
1.2),
which
extends
naturally
to
an
object
†
EC
→
C
over
C
(cf.
[Mzk1],
Chapter
III,
Corollary
4.3).
In
[Mzk3],
§1,
we
†
→
C,
i.e.,
constructed
(in
the
case
of
a
base
which
is
ﬂat
over
Z)
an
object
EC,et
the
“universal
extension
equipped
with
the
étale
integral
structure.”
By
reducing
this
object
(in
the
case
of
a
Z-ﬂat
base)
modulo
p,
we
may
thus
also
speak
of
†
→
S
in
the
present
context
of
a
base
S
over
Fp
.
Moreover,
in
addition
to
EC,et
this
“full
étale
integral
structure,”
we
also
constructed
“intermediate
étale
integral
†;{N
}
†
†
and
EC
structures
EC,et
(where
N
≥
0
is
an
integer)
which
“lie
between
EC,et
†
and
coincide
with
EC,et
in
relative
degrees
≤
N
”
—
cf.
the
discussion
at
the
end
of
†;{N
}
†
[Mzk3],
§4,
for
more
details.
Just
as
in
the
case
of
EC,et
,
even
though
the
EC,et
were
deﬁned
over
Z-ﬂat
bases,
by
reducing
modulo
p,
it
makes
sense
to
speak
of
†;{N
}
the
EC,et
in
the
present
context
of
a
base
S
over
Fp
.
Now
let
us
ﬁx
an
integer
n
≥
0.
Then
it
follows
from
the
construction
of
the
étale
integral
structure
in
[Mzk3],
§1,
that
for
some
suﬃciently
large
integer
m
≥
n
(depending
on
n),
we
have
a
canonical
section
†;{pn
−1}
κHm
:
Hm
→
EC,et
†;{pn
−1}
of
EC,et
→
C
over
the
“covering”
[pm
]H
:
Hm
→
C.
(Here,
we
assume,
for
the
moment
that
the
q-parameter
of
our
log
elliptic
curve
admits
a
pm
-th
root
at
all
points
of
D.
In
fact,
we
shall
see
shortly
that
if
suﬃces
to
take
m
equal
to
n.)
Thus,
if
we
think
of
the
structure
sheaves
of
the
various
objects
which
are
aﬃne
over
C
as
OC
-algebras,
then
pulling
back
functions
by
κHm
deﬁnes
a
morphism
O
<p†
n
EC,et
n
=
O
<p†;{pn
−1}
→
OHm
EC,et
Here
the
superscript
“<
pn
”
denotes
the
functions
of
“relative
(or
‘torsorial’)
degree
<
pn
”
(cf.
[Mzk3],
§1,
for
more
details).
We
are
now
ready
to
state
and
prove
the
main
result
of
this
§,
which
is
a
sort
of
“Verschiebung-theoretic
analogue”
of
the
“Hodge-Arakelov
Comparison
Isomorphism”
of
[Mzk1]:
Theorem
1.1.
(Verschiebung-Theoretic
Analogue
of
the
Hodge-Arakelov
Comparison
Isomorphism)
Assume
that
the
q-parameter
of
the
log
elliptic
curve
C
log
→
S
log
admits
a
pn
-th
root
at
all
points
of
D.
Then
the
morphism
just
deﬁned
in
fact
factors
through
OGn
⊆
OGm
⊆
OHm
and
induces
an
isomorphism
O
<p†

EC,et
n
∼
=
O
<p†;{pn

→
OGn
EC,et
POSITIVE

†;{pn
−1}
of
rank
pn
vector
bundles
on
C.
In
particular,
the
morphism
κHm
:
Hm
→
EC,et
factors
as
the
triple
composite
of
the
morphism
Φm
H
:
Hm
→
Gm
,
the
natural
projection
Gm
→
Gn
,
and
a
morphism
†;{pn
−1}
κGn
:
Gn
→
EC,et
(which
is
necessarily
unique).
Remark.
In
particular,
in
the
simplest
(nontrivial)
case
n
=
1,
we
obtain
an
isomorphism
O
<p†
=
O
<p†
EC
EC,et
∼
→
O
G1
i.e.,
in
this
case,
one
can
deﬁne
the
isomorphism
without
ever
mentioning
“étale
integral
structures.”
Moreover,
(as
was
pointed
out
to
the
author
by
M.
Emerton)
in
this
case,
(if
we
assume,
for
simplicity,
that
S
=
US
,
then)
the
morphism
κ
G1
:
G
1
=
E
F
→
E
†
is
the
morphism
deﬁned
by
associating
to
a
point
of
E
F
(which
may
be
thought
of
as
a
line
bundle
L
of
degree
0
on
E
F
)
the
line
bundle
(of
degree
0)
with
connection
on
E
(i.e.,
point
of
E
†
)
given
by
Φ∗E
L
equipped
with
the
unique
connection
for
which
sections
of
L
are
horizontal.
Of
course,
one
expects
that
a
similar
explicit
description
can
be
given
for
n
≥
1.
We
leave
the
(routine)
details
of
working
out
such
a
description
to
the
enthusiastic
reader.
Proof.
Let
us
ﬁrst
show
that
the
morphism
factors
through
OGn
,
as
asserted.
First,
note
that
by
working
in
the
universal
case
(where,
say,
S
is
isomorphic
to
a
copy
of
(Mell
)Fp
,
and
the
classifying
morphism
S
→
(Mell
)Fp
is
given
by
a
power
of
the
Frobenius
morphism),
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
this
factorization
holds
in
a
neighborhood
of
the
divisor
at
inﬁnity.
But
in
a
neighborhood
of
inﬁnity
(where
the
Frobenius
and
Verschiebung
lift
naturally
to
mixed
characteristic),
the
section
κHm
factors
through
Gm
(cf.
[Mzk3],
§1).
Thus,
we
see
immediately
that
the
morphism
in
question
maps
into
OGm
⊆
OHm
.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
(cf.
the
discussion
of
[Mzk3],
§2)
if
we
apply
the
basechange
Gm
→
C,
it
follows
that
the
morphism
in
question
T

amounts
to
the
mapngiven
by
evaluating
linear
combinations
of
the
polynomials
j
(where
j
=
0,
.
.
.
,
p
−
1)
on
the
points
given
by
mapping
T
to
an
element
of
Z/pm
Z.
Thus,
these
polynomials
deﬁne
functions
on
the
ﬁnite
set
Z/pm
Z.
But,
by
Lemma
1.2
below,
these
functions
in
fact
arise
from
functions
on
the
quotient
Z/pm
Z

Z/pn
Z.
Since
this
quotient
corresponds
to
the
intermediate
covering
Gm
→
Gn
→
C
(of
Gm
→
C),
it
thus
follows
that
the
morphism
in
question
maps
into
OGn
⊆
OGm
,
as
desired.
Note
that
the
analysis
of
the
preceding
paragraph
(cf.
[Mzk3],
§2)
shows
also
that
the
morphism
in
question
6
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
O
<p†
n
EC,et
→
OGn
is
injective,
at
least
in
a
neighborhood
of
inﬁnity.
Indeed,
this
follows
from
the
fact
that
the
left-
(respectively,
right-)
hand
side
of
this
morphism
injects
into
the
reduction
modulo
p
of
the
sheaf
of
functions
on
the
right-
(respectively,
left-)
hand
side
of
the
isomorphism
F
κ∞
et
:
E
∞
∼
†
∧
→
(Eet
)
of
[Mzk3],
Theorem
2.2
(in
such
a
way
that
the
morphism
in
question
is
compatible
∼
with
the
isomorphism
“→”
of
loc.
cit.).
Thus,
in
summary,
we
have
a
morphism
O
<p†
n
EC,et
→
OGn
between
two
vector
bundles
of
rank
pn
on
C
which
is
generically
an
isomorphism
(since
it
is
injective
near
inﬁnity,
and
the
ranks
are
the
same).
Now
if
we
work
in
the
universal
case
(i.e.,
where
S
is
isomorphic
to
a
copy
of
(Mell
)Fp
,
and
the
classifying
morphism
S
→
(Mell
)Fp
is
given
by
a
power
of
the
Frobenius
morphism),
then
in
order
to
conclude
that
this
morphism
is
an
isomorphism,
it
suﬃces
to
observe
n
(since
C
is
proper
and
integral
over
Fp
)
that
the
determinant
bundles
of
O
<p†
and
EC,et
def
OGn
deﬁne
the
same
class
in
PicQ
(C)
=
Pic(C)
⊗Z
Q.
But
it
is
clear
from
the
†
construction
of
EC,et
(cf.
[Mzk3],
§1)
that
n
[det(O<p†
)]
=
−
EC,et
pn

[ωE

—
where
[−]
denotes
the
class
of
a

bundle
in
PicQ
(C)
(thought
of
as
an
additive
group),
and
ωE
denotes
the
line
bundle
on
S
given
by
the
relative
cotangent
bundle
of
E
over
S
restricted
to
the
zero
section
0E
:
S
→
E.
On
the
other
hand,
let
us
observe
that
the
inverse
image
Gn
×C
0C
⊆
Gn
of
the
zero
section
0C
:
S
→
C
of
C
forms
a
ﬁnite
ﬂat
group
scheme
over
S,
which
we
shall
denote
by
Gn
[VGn
].
Since
the
covering
Gn
→
C
is
clearly
a
Gn
[VGn
]-torsor,
we
have
Gn
×C
Gn

It

only
to

this

from
the

that
the

ωE

Thus,
any

would
imply
the
existence
of

By

:

that
are
compatible
with
each
other
and
with
the
above
commutative
diagram.
Next,
let
us
assume
that
we
are
given
a
torsion
point
ηH
∈
Hn
(S)
of
order
m,
where
(m,
p)
=
1.
Write
ηG
∈
Gn
(S)
for
the
image
of
ηH
in
Gn
(S).
These
torsion
points
deﬁne
sheaves
def
LH
=
OHn
(pn
·
[ηH
]);
def
LG
=
OGn
([ηG
])
on
Hn
and
Gn
,
respectively,
which
are
(ample)
line
bundles
over
US
.
Near
inﬁnity,
these
sheaves
are
only
coherent,
but,
in
fact,
may
in
most
cases
be
treated
as
ample
line
bundles,
by
working
(in
a
neighborhood
of
inﬁnity)
with
appropriate
μm
-coverings
Hn
→
Hn
;
Gn
→
Gn
(i.e.,
coverings
which
induce
bijections
on
the
various
irreducible
components
of
the
special
ﬁbers
at
inﬁnity,
and
which
induce
the
“raising
to
the
m-th
power
maps”
on
each
of
the
copies
of
Gm
in
the
special
ﬁbers
at
inﬁnity).
These
coverings
have
the
property
that
the
divisors
[ηH
],
[ηG
]
become
Cartier
when
pulled
back
via
these
coverings.
Thus,
one
may
think
of
sections
of
the
sheaves
LH
,
LG
over
Hn
,
Gn
,
as
μm
-invariant
sections
of
the
resulting
(ample)
line
bundles
over
Hn
,
Gn
.
Note,
moreover,
that
since
μm
is
a
group
scheme
of
multiplicative
type,
the
operation
of
taking
μm
-invariants
is
exact.
In
particular,
it
follows
that
(if,
by
abuse
of
notation,
we
denote
all
structure
morphisms
to
S
by
f
)
the
push-forward
sheaves
f∗
(LH
|H†n
);
f∗
(LG
|Gn†
)
admit
natural
ﬁltrations
F
r
(−)
(of
ranks
r

pn

r,
respectively,
for
r
=
1,
.
.
.
,
pn
)
whose
successive
subquotients
F
r+1
/F
r
(−)
may
be
identiﬁed
with

(LH
);
11
τE⊗r

f∗

def
∨
(where
τE
=
ωE
),
respectively.
Moreover,
since
ΦnH
is
purely
inseparable
of
degree
n
p
,
it
follows
that
the
divisor
(ΦnH
)−1
([ηG
])
is
linearly
equivalent
to
the
divisor
pn
[ηH
].
This
gives
rise
to
a
natural
Hn
[ΦnH
]-action
on
LH
(compatible
with
the
evident
Hn
[ΦnH
]-action
on
Hn
itself).
Relative
to
this
action,
we
have
n
f∗
(LG
|Gn†
)
=
f∗
(LH
|H†n
)Hn
[ΦH
]
(where
the
superscript
Hn
[ΦnH
]
denotes
“Hn
[ΦnH
]-invariants”).
We
are
now
ready
to
deﬁne
the
evaluation
maps
that
will
appear
in
the
comparison
isomorphisms.
First,
we
observe
that
by
using
the
sections
κH†n
,
κGn†
,
we
may
regard
the
group
schemes
Hn
[pn
]
⊆
Hn
;
Gn
[VGn
]
⊆
Gn
(i.e.,
the
kernels
of
the
morphisms
[pn
]H
:
Hn
→
C;
VGn
:
Gn
→
C,
respectively)
as
being
contained
in
Hn†
,
Gn†
,
respectively.
Thus,
restriction
to
these
subschemes
yields
morphisms
ΞH
:
f∗
(LH
|H†n
)
→
LH
|Hn
[pn
]
ΞG
:
f∗
(LG
|Gn†
)
→
LG
|Gn
[VGn
]
with
the
property
that
the
latter
morphism
is
the
result
of
applying
the
operation
of
taking
Hn
[ΦnH
]-invariants
to
the
former.
Before
proving
the
comparison
isomorphisms
involving
these
evaluation
maps,
we
would
like
to
discuss
some
technical
points,
as
follows:
First,
let
us
note
that
the
tautological
inclusion
OGn
→
OGn
([ηG
])
=
LG
deﬁnes
a
morphism
OS
→
f∗
(LG
)
whose
composite
with
the
restriction
morphism
f∗
(LG
)
→
LG
|0G
=
OS
(where
we
use
the
fact
that
since
the
order
m
of
ηG
is
prime
to
p,
we
have
0G
ηG
=
∅)
is
the
identity.
In
fact,
it
is
easy
to
see
that
here,
0G
may
be
replayed
by
any
pn
-torsion
point,
and
hence
that
(by
elementary
algebraic
geometry)
we
have
the
following:
Lemma
2.1.
These
two
morphisms
are
isomorphisms,
i.e.,
we
have:

is

a

on

Next,
we
would
like
to
relate
the
evaluation
maps
constructed
above
to
those
that
appear
in
the

of

To
do
this,

Indeed,
by

one
sees
that

Let

Also,
similar
statements
hold
for

Now
we
are
ready
to

let

write
∞

i.e.,
in

we
obtain
the

fact
that
∞

If
we

the

is
given
by

Proposition

applies
to
the

of
the
present
§
as
follows:
First
of
all,
since
the
order
m
of

is
prime
to
p,
it
follows
that
(at
least
over
US
)
the
Hodge
torsor
associated
to

is
naturally
isomorphic
(cf.

to
(the
reduction
modulo

of)
the
object
E[p

appearing

in
Proposition
2.2.
Thus,
(since
the
object

is
clearly
†
the
same
as
the
reduction
modulo
p
of
the

Proposition
2.2
implies
that:
The

isomorphic
to

A

statement
holds
for

Thus,
in

it
follows
that:
The

with

properties:
(1)
ΞG
is
an

over

def
(2)
ΞH
is
an
isomorphism
over
US
=
S\D.
Here,
D
⊆
S
is
the
pull-back
to
S
of
the
divisor
at
inﬁnity
of
the
moduli
stack
(Mell
)Fp
.
Proof.
First,
I
claim
that
over
US
,
ΞG
is
an
isomorphism
if
and
only
if
ΞH
is.
Indeed,
to
simplify
notation,
let
us
assume
(just
for
the
remainder
of
this
paragraph)
that
US
=
S.
Then
it
follows
that
the
theta
group
(cf.
[Mumf1,2,3];
[Mumf4],
§23;
or,
alternatively,
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IV,
§1,
for
an
exposition
of
the
theory
of
theta
groups)
GLH
of
LH
acts
on
the
line
bundle
LH
.
Since
LH
has
relative
degree
pn
over
S,
this
theta
group
ﬁts
into
an
exact
sequence
1
→
Gm
→
GLH
→
E[pn
]
→
1
and
the
fact
that
(ΦnG
)∗
LG
=
LH
implies
that
LG
determines
a
section
sG
:
E[ΦnE
]
→
GLH
of
this
exact
sequence
over
E[ΦnE
]
⊆
E[pn
]
⊆
E.
In
the
terminology
of
theta
groups,
the
image
of
sG
is
a
Lagrangian
subgroup
of
the
theta
group
(cf.
[MB],
Chapitre
V,
Déﬁnition
2.5.1).
It
thus
follows
from
the
theory
of
GLH
modules
that
the
GLH
-linear
morphism
ΞH
is
an
isomorphism
if
and
only
if
the
morphism
ΞG
—
which
is
obtained
from
ΞH
by
taking
E[ΦnE
]-invariants
—
is
an
isomorphism.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
claim.
The
fact
that
ΞG
is
an
isomorphism
may
be
proven
by
arguing
as
follows:
First,
we
observe
that
it
suﬃces
to
work
in
the
universal
case,
where,
say,
S
is
proper,
connected,
and
smooth
of
dimension
1
over
Fp
,
and
the
classifying
morphism
S
→
(Mell
)Fp
is
ﬁnite.
Then
ΞG
is
a
morphism
between
two
vector
bundles
of
rank
pn
on
S,
hence
it
will
be
an
isomorphism
as
soon
as
we
verify
the
following
two
facts:
(1)
ΞG
is
an
isomorphism
over
the
generic
point
of
S.
16
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
(2)
The
degrees
of
the
domain
and
range
of
ΞG
coincide.
Fact
(1)
follows
from
the
second
Remark
following
Proposition
2.2,
together
with
the
analysis
in
a
neighborhood
of
inﬁnity
given,
for
instance,
in
[Mzk1],
Chapter
V,
Theorem
6.2
(cf.
also
[Mzk3],
§6).
Fact
(2)
follows
from
the
fact
that
(in
light
of
Lemma
2.1)
the
domain
(respectively,
range)
of
ΞG
has
the
same
degree
as
the
domain
(respectively,
range)
of
the
isomorphism
of
Corollary
1.4.
This
completes
the
proof
that
ΞG
is
an
isomorphism.

Remark.
Thus,
in
particular,
the
above
argument
gives
a
new
proof
of
the
(schemetheoretic)
characteristic
zero
portion
of
[Mzk1],
Theorem
A
—
at
least
in
the
case
when
d
is
a
power
of
a
prime
number,
and
m
is
prime
to
d.
More
precisely,
although
we
used
the
computation
at
inﬁnity
of
[Mzk1],
the
characteristic
p
argument
given
above
may
be
used
to
replace
the
complicated
degree
computations
(especially
when
d
is
even!)
of
[Mzk1],
Chapter
VI,
proof
of
Theorem
3.1.
(Note
that
although
here
we
are
working
in
characteristic
p,
we
obtain
characteristic
zero
consequences,
since
any
morphism
between
vector
bundles
on
a
ﬂat,
proper
Z-scheme
which
is
an
isomorphism
modulo
p
is
necessarily
an
isomorphism
over
Q.)
Also,
we
observe
that,
in
fact:
The
above
argument
furnishes
a
new
proof
of
the
scheme-theoretic,
characteristic
zero
portion
of
the
Hodge-Arakelov
Comparison
Isomorphism
(i.e.,
[Mzk1],
Theorem
A)
for
arbitrary
d,
m
(as
in
the
statement
of
this
Theorem).
Indeed,
this
follows
from
the
fact
that
the
essential
point
of
this
characteristic
zero
portion
of
the
theorem
is
a
certain
coincidence
of
degrees
(cf.
the
degree
computations
of
[Mzk1],
Chapter
VI,
proof
of
Theorem
3.1).
On
the
other
hand,
it
is
relatively
easy
to
see
(without
computing
the
degrees
precisely!)
that
the
two
degrees
in
question
are
both
polynomials
in
d.
Thus,
their
diﬀerence
is
a
polynomial
in
d
which
vanishes
(by
the
above
characteristic
p
argument)
for
all
d
equal
to
a
power
of
(suﬃciently
large)
p.
But
this
implies
that
this
diﬀerence
is
identically
zero
(for
all
d).
Remark.
One
way
to
interpret
the
preceding
Remark
is
the
following:
The
characteristic
p
methods
(involving
the
Frobenius
and
Verschiebung
morphisms)
of
the
present
paper
yield
a
new
proof
of
the
various
combinatorial
identities
inherent
in
the
computation
of
degrees
in
[Mzk1],
Chapter
VI,
proof
of
Theorem
3.1.
This
situation
is
rather
reminiscent
of
the
situation
of
[Mzk5],
Chapter
V
—
cf.,
especially,
the
second
Remark
following
Corollary
1.3.
Namely,
in
that
case,
as
well,
characteristic
p
methods
(involving
Frobenius
and
Verschiebung)
give
rise
to
various
nontrivial
combinatorial
identities.
It
would
be
interesting
if
this
sort
of
phenomenon
could
be
understood
more
clearly
at
a
conceptual
level.

Remark.
One
interesting
feature
of
the
above
proof
is
the
crucial
use
of
the
isogeny
ΦnH
:
Hn
→
Gn
,
i.e.,
(over
US
)
the
(n-th
iterate
of
the)
Frobenius
morphism
ΦnE
:
n
E
→
E
F
.
Put
another
way,
this
amounts
to
the
use
of
the
subgroup
scheme
E[ΦnE
]
⊆
E
(i.e.,
the
kernel
of
ΦnE
),
which,
of
course,
does
not
exist
in
characteristic
zero.
Note
that
this
subgroup
scheme
is
essentially
the
same
as
the
“multiplicative
subspace”
that
played
an
essential
role
in
[Mzk4],
§2.
That
is
to
say,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
just
as
in
the
context
of
[Mzk4]
(cf.,
especially,
§3,
4)
the
crucial
arithmetic
object
that
one
wants
over
a
number
ﬁeld
is
a
“global
multiplicative
subspace,”
in
the
above
proof,
the
crucial
arithmetic
object
that
makes
the
proof
work
(in
positive!
characteristic)
is
the
“global
multiplicative
subspace”
E[ΦnE
]
⊆
E
(which
is
deﬁned
over
all
of
(Mell
)Fp
).
Remark.
Another
interesting
and
key
point
in
the
above
proof
is
the
fact
that,
unlike
the
case
in
characteristic
zero
(where
the
structure
sheaf
of
a
ﬁnite
ﬂat
group
scheme
on
a
proper
curve
always
has
degree
zero):
In
positive
characteristic,
the
structure
sheaf
of
a
ﬁnite
ﬂat
group
scheme
on
a
proper
curve
can
have
nonzero
degree.
In
fact,
it
is
precisely
because
of
this
phenomenon
that
in
order
to
make
the
comparison
isomorphism
hold
in
characteristic
zero
over
the
proper
object
(Mell
)Q
,
it
is
necessary
to
introduce
Gaussian
poles
(cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk1],

would
like
to
work
out
the

Endow

Thus,
we
obtain
a
morphism
Z

log
of
log
schemes.
Next,
let
us
write
Ed,Z
→
Z

for
the
object

is
equal
to
the

EZ

Z,
and,
“near

is
the

of
the

“Ed

(cf.
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IV,
§4,
where
we
take
“N

of
loc.
cit.
to
be
d).
In
words,
this
object
“Ed
”
is
the
result
of
removing
the
nodes
from
the
unique
regular
semi-stable
model
of
the
Tate

(with
q-parameter
“q”)
over
the

∗
Z[[q

Then
the
object
“E[d],et
→
E”
of
[Mzk3],
§9,
deﬁnes
an
object
∗
E[d],et,Z
→

(which,
over
(UZ
)Q
,
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
universal
extension
E
†
→
E
of
E)
over
Ed,Z
.
Indeed,
the
discussion
of
[Mzk3],
§9,
applies
literally
over
UZ
;
“near
inﬁnity,”
the
fact
that
we
get
an
object
over
Ed,Z
follows
from
the
fact
that
the


integral
structure
in
question,
i.e.,
“
d·(T
−(irχ

”
(in
the

[Mzk3],
§9)
is
invariant
with
respect
to
the
transformations
T

+
dj
,
∀j
∈
Z.
Next,
let
us
observe
EZ
has
a
unique
ﬁnite
ﬂat
subgroup
scheme
GμZ
annihilated
by
d.
This
subgroup
scheme
is
naturally
isomorphic
to
μd
.
Thus,
we
have:
μ
μd
∼
=
GZ
⊆
EZ
[d]
⊆
Ed,Z
(where
EZ
[d]
⊆
Ed,Z
denotes
the
closed
subscheme
which
is
the
kernel
of
multiplication
by
d
on
Ed,Z
).
Note,
moreover,
that,
in
fact,
GμZ
descends
to
a

GμS

group
schemes.
Thus,
if
we
write
EHZ
=
Ed,Z
/HZ
,
then
we
see
that
EHZ
→
Z
is
a
one-dimensional
semi-abelian
group
scheme
(i.e.,
its
ﬁbers
are
all
geometrically
connected),
and
that
the
natural
quotient
morphism
(EZ
⊆)
Ed,Z

EHZ
(over
Z)
has
kernel
equal
to
HZ
,
hence
is
ﬁnite
étale
of
degree
d.
Moreover,
we
note
that
the
q-parameter
of
EHZ
is
a
d-th
root
of
q.
In
particular,
(unlike
GμZ
)
HZ
is
not
deﬁned
over
S.
Next,
let
us
assume
that
we
have
been
given
an
odd
integer
m
>
1,
together
with
a
torsion
point
η
∈
E∞,S
(S∞
)
of
order
precisely
m
which
deﬁnes
a
metrized
line
bundle
def
L
=
Lst,η
on
E∞,S
(cf.
[Mzk1],
Chapter
V,
§1,
for
a
discussion
of
the
construction
of
the
object
“Lst,η
”).
Thus,
in
particular,
over
US
:
L|US
=
OE
(d
·
[η])|US
Here,
we
recall
that
S∞
is
the
stack
(in
the
ﬁnite,
ﬂat
topology)
obtained
from
S
by
gluing
together
US
(“away
from
inﬁnity”)
to
the
proﬁnite
covering
of
S
(“near
inﬁnity”)
deﬁned
by
“adjoining
a
compatible
system
of
M
-th
roots
of
the
q-parameter”
(as
M
ranges
multiplicatively
over
the
positive
integers).
Over
S∞
,
we
have
the
group
object
E∞,S
→
S∞
which
is
equal
to
E
→
S
over
US
(“away
from
inﬁnity”),
and
whose
“special
ﬁber”
consists
of
connected
components
indexed
by
Q/Z,
each
of
which
is
isomorphic
to
a
copy
of
Gm
—
cf.
the
discussion
of
[Mzk1],
Chapter
V,
§2,
for
more
details.
Note
that
L
has
an
associated
theta
group
(cf.
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IV,
§1,
§5,
for
a
discussion
of
theta
groups)
GZ
over
Z
which
ﬁts
into
an
exact
sequence:

Also,
let
us
assume
that
we
are
given
a
lifting
HZ
⊆
GZ
∼
of
HZ
(i.e.,
HZ
→HZ
via
GZ
→
EZ
[d]).
Thus,
HZ
is
a
“Lagrangian
subgroup”
(cf.
[MB],
Chapitre
V,
Déﬁnition
2.5.1)
of
the
theta
group
GZ
.
In
particular,
we
get
a
natural
action
of
HZ
∼
=
HZ
on
L.
Remark.
To
see
that
such
a
lifting
HZ
⊆
GZ
exists,
one
may,
for
instance,
apply
the
canonical
section
of
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IV,
Theorem
1.6,
(1),
over
a
double
covering


→
Ed,Z
(so
L|Ed,Z
will
be
a
(metrized)
line
bundle
of
degree
2d)
with
the
Ed,Z
∼

property
that
HZ
⊆
Ed,Z
lifts
to
a
subgroup
scheme
HZ
⊆
Ed,Z
such
that
HZ
→HZ
.

Note
that
since
the
q-parameter
of
Ed,Z
will
then
necessarily
be
a
square
root
of
q,

it
follows
that
in
order
to
ensure
that
HZ
exist,
we
need
to
know
the
existence
of
a
2d-th
root
of
q
in
OZ
.
This
is
why
we
deﬁned
“Z”
as
we
did
(i.e.,
rather
than
with
the
“2N
·
d”
replaced
by
“N
·
d,”
as
was
done
in
the
case
of
odd
p).
In
the
following
discussion,
we
will
always
denote
(by
abuse
of
notation)
structure
morphisms
to
S,
Z,
E∞,S
by
f
(cf.
the
conventions
of
[Mzk1]).
We
would
like
to
consider
the
push-forward
def
∗
)
VL
=
f∗
(LE[d],et,Z
∗
∗
of
the
metrized
line
bundle
L
to
E[d],et,Z
.
Here,
we
take
the
of
the
pull-back
LE[d],et,Z
integral
structure
of
this
push-forward
“near
inﬁnity”
to
be
the
unique
GZ
-stable
integral
structure
determined
by
the
“ζrCG
”
—
cf.
[Mzk1],
Chapter
V,
Theorem
4.8;
the
discussion
of
[Mzk3],
§4.1,
4.2.
Thus,
VL
is
a
quasi-coherent
sheaf
on
Z,
equipped
with
a
ﬁltration
F
r
(VL
)
⊆
VL
,
i.e.,
the
subsheaf
consisting
of
sections
whose
“torsorial
degree”
is
<
r.
(Here,
by
“torsorial
degree,”
we
mean
the
relative
degree
with
respect
to
the
structure
of
“relative
polynomial
algebra”
on
OE
†
over
OE
(arising
from
the
fact
that
E
†
→
E
is
an
aﬃne
torsor).
Since
E
†
may
be
∗
over
(UZ
)Q
,
this
deﬁnition
also
applies
to
sections
of
VL
.)
identiﬁed
with
E[d],et,Z
In
particular,
we
shall
write
def
HDR
=
F
d
(VL
)
for
the
object
which
appears
in
[Mzk1],
Introduction,
Theorem
A
(cf.
also
[Mzk3],
Theorem
9.2).
Thus,
HDR
is
a
vector
bundle
of
rank
d
on
Z.
Finally,
observe
that
the
theta
group
GZ
acts
naturally
on
VL
,
F
r
(VL
),
HDR
.
Now
we
come
to
the

Proposition
3.1.
The
objects
introduced
above
satisfy
the
following
properties:
†
∗
(i)
The
integral
structure
of
E[d],et,Z
is
equal
to
that
of
E[d],et,Z
=
def

E[d],et
|Z
(i.e.,
the

of
the
universal
extension
Eet
|Z
over
Z
equipped
with
the
étale
integral
structure
—
cf.
the
notation
of
[Mzk3],
§9).
In
particular,
the
d-torsion
subgroup
scheme
EZ
[d]
⊆
Ed,Z
∗
lifts
naturally
to
a
subgroup
scheme
EZ∗
[d]
⊆
E[d],et,Z

The

GμZ

GZ
(cf.
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IV,
Theorem
1.6,
(1))
extends
to
all
of
GμZ
.
In
particular,
(despite
the
fact
that
d
is
even!)
we
obtain
a
theta
trivialization
L|GμZ
∼
=
L|0EZ
⊗OZ
OGμZ
def
Here,
0EZ
∈
EZ
(Z)
is
the
zero
section
of
EZ
=
E
×S
Z
→
Z.
Proof.
Assertion
(i)
follows
from
the
fact
that
the
integral
structure
used
to
deﬁne


∗
is
given
by
“
d·(T
−(irχ
/2m))
”
(in
the
notation
of
[Mzk3],
§9),
an
expression
E[d],et,Z


which
gives
the
same
integral
structure
as
“
d·T
r
.”
Note
that
here
we
use
the
assumptions
that
(a.)
m
is
odd;
(b.)
d
>
1
is
even.
Assertion
(ii)
is
proven
by
observing
that,
if
we
descend
L
to
some
LH
(via
the
lifting
HZ
⊆
GZ
discussed
above)
on
EHZ
,
the
resulting
degree
1
(metrized)
line
bundle
is
(up
to
translation
by
an
odd
order
torsion
point)
that
deﬁned
by
a
nonmultiplicative
(i.e.,
lying
outside
the
image
of
GμZ
in
EHZ
)
order
2
torsion
point.
In
particular,
the
invariant
“iχ
/2m”
associated
to
this
LH
is
∈
Z2
(cf.
the
theory
of
[Mzk1],
Chapter
V,
§4;
as
well
as
[Mzk1],
Chapter
IV,
Lemma
5.4;
the
discussion
of
[Mzk3],
§4.3).
Put
another
way,
the
essential
phenomenon
at
work
here
is
the
elementary
numerical
fact
that
(for
D
≥
1
an
integer)
1

1
j
=
(D
−
1)
D
j=0
2
D−1
lies
∈
Z
if
D
is
odd,
and
∈
12
Z\Z
if
D
is
even.
On
the
other
hand,
(as
one
may
recall
from
the
discussion
of
[Mzk3],
§4.3
—
cf.,
especially,
the
proof
of
Lemma
4.1):
The
class
of
this
invariant
“iχ
/2m”
associated
to
LH
in
12
Z2
/Z2
is
precisely
the
obstruction
to
the
existence
of
the
desired
section
GμZ
→
GZ
.
22
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
Thus,
the
fact
that
this
invariant
is
∈
Z2
implies
that
this
obstruction
is
0,
as
desired.

Remark.
The
description
of
LH
given
in
the
above
proof
shows
that
in
fact,
this
(a
priori)
metrized
line
bundle
is
deﬁned
as
an
ordinary
line
bundle
over
some
semistable
model
of
EHZ
=
Ed,Z
/HZ
over
Z.
(More
precisely,
the
semi-stable
model
with
the
property
that
the
group
of
irreducible
components
of
its
special
ﬁber
is
1
Z/Z
is
suﬃcient.)
In
particular,
it
follows
that
L
(respectively,
VL
)
is
equal
to
2N
deﬁned
as
an
“ordinary
line
bundle”
(respectively,
“ordinary
vector
bundle”)
over
some
semi-stable
model
of
EZ
→
Z
(respectively,
over
Z).
Next,
let
us
note
that
since
L
is
deﬁned
over
E∞,S
(i.e.,
without
base-changing
to
Z),
it
follows
that
L|0EZ
is,
in
fact,
deﬁned
over
S∞
(i.e.,
in
other
words,
it
is
deﬁned
over
S,
except
that
“near
inﬁnity,”
one
may
need
to
adjoin
roots
of
the
q-parameter).
In
particular,
it
follows
that
there
is
a
natural
action
of
Gal(Z/S)
—
hence
of
ΠS
(via
the
surjection
ΠS

Gal(Z/S))
—
on
L0EZ
.
Let
us
denote
HZ
-invariants
by
means
of
a
superscript
HZ
.
Then
recall
that
HZ
VL
admits
the
following
interpretation:
Since
HZ
∼
=
HZ
acts
on
Ed,Z
;
E∞,S
;
∗
E[d],et,Z
;
L,
we
may
form
the
quotients
of
these
objects
by
this
action.
This
yields
∗
objects
(Ed,Z
)H
(i.e.,
EHZ
),
(E∞,S
)H
,
(E[d],et,Z
)H
,
LH
(a
metrized
line
bundle
on
(E∞,S
)H
).
Then
we
have:
∗
VLHZ
=
f∗
{LH
|(E[d],et,Z
)H
}
(where
f
as
usual
denotes
the

and
composing
with

we
obtain
a

Similarly,
if

introduce

we

with

Z
ΞGP,H
of

and

deﬁne
a

action
of

on

which
we

refer
to

Remark.
Just
as
in
[Mzk4],
§2.1,
(unlike
the
“naive”
Galois
action)
the
Lagrangian
Galois
action
depends
on
the
choice
of
the
additional
data
GμZ
,
HZ
.
Also,
just
as
in
[Mzk4],
§2.1,
although
a
priori,
the
Lagrangian
Galois
action
appears
to
require
the
HZ
Gaussian
poles
(i.e.,
it
appears
that
it
is
not
necessarily
integrally
deﬁned
on
HDR
),
in
fact,
however,
we
shall
see
in
§3.2
below
that
the
Lagrangian
Galois
action
has
the
remarkable
property
that
it
is
deﬁned
without
introducing
the
Gaussian

Crystalline
Properties
We
maintain
the
notation
of
§3.1.
The
ﬁrst
portion
of
[Mzk4],
§2.2,
now
goes
through
with
little
change:
As
in
loc.
cit.,
we
ﬁrst
would
like
to
relate
the
present
discussion
to
the
theory
of
connections
in
[Mzk3].
Thus,
recall
that
L|0EZ
is
a
line
bundle
on
Z
equipped
with
a
natural
ΠS
-action
derived
from
a
trivialization
τ
:
L|0EZ
∼
=
q
−
2N
·d
·
OZ
a
(where
a
is
a
nonnegative
integer
<
2N
d)
—
which,
in
the
terminology
of
the
discussion
of
[Mzk3],
§5,
determines
a
ΠS
-equivariant
rigidiﬁcation
τ
of
L
at
0EZ
.
In
particular,
τ
deﬁnes
a
ΠS
-invariant
logarithmic
connection
on
the
line
bundle
L|0EZ
.
Thus,
by
the
theory
of
[Mzk3],
§5,
this
rigidiﬁcation
gives
rise
to
a
ΠS
invariant
(logarithmic)
connection
∇V
H
Z
L
24
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
on
VLHZ
(cf.
[Mzk3],
Theorems
5.2,
8.1).
Here,
the
logarithmic
connections
are
relative
to
the
log
structure
of
Z
log
,
and
all
connections,
diﬀerentials,
etc.,
are
to
be
understood
as
being
continuous
with
respect
to
the
(p,
q)-adic
topology
on
OZ
.
Just
as
in
[Mzk4],
§2.2,
since
all
higher
p-curvatures
of
these
connections
vanish
(cf.
[Mzk3],
§7.1,
for
a
discussion
of
the
general
theory
of
higher
p-curvatures;
[Mzk3],
Corollary
7.6,
for
the
vanishing
result
just
quoted),
we
thus
conclude
that
the
pair
(VLHZ
,
∇V
HZ
)
L
deﬁnes
a
crystal
on
the
site
Inf(Z
log
⊗
k/A)
of
(all
—
i.e.,
not
just
PD-)
inﬁnitesimal
thickenings
over
A
of
open
sub-log
schemes
of
Z
log
⊗
k
=
Z
log
⊗
(A/mA
).
One
veriﬁes
immediately
(using
the
simple
explicit
structures
of
S,
Z)
that
the
action
of
ΠS
on
OZ
satisﬁes:
σ(φ)
≡
φ
(mod
mA
·
OZ
)
∀σ
∈
ΠS
,
φ
∈
OZ
,
and
that
the
correspondence
1
1
ΠS

σ
→
σ(q
2N
·d
)/q
2N
·d
deﬁnes
morphisms:
∼
ΠS

Gal(Z/S)
→
(Z/2dZ)(1)
(where
the
ﬁrst
(respectively,
second)
arrow
is
a
surjection
(respectively,
isomorphism)).
Next,
let
us
observe
that
the
property
just
discussed
concerning
the
action
of
ΠS
on
OZ
implies
that
every
σ
∈
ΠS
deﬁnes
an
A-linear
isomorphism
∼
σ
:
Z
log
→
Z
log
which
is
the
identity
on
Z
log
⊗
k.
It
thus
follows
from:
(i)
the
fact
that
Z
log
deﬁnes
a(n)
(inductive
system
of)
thickening(s)
in
the
category
Inf(Z
log
⊗
k/A);
and
(ii)
the
fact
that
(VLHZ

that

means
semi-linear
with

to
the

,
and
the

denotes
p-adic

As
in
[Mzk4],
§2.2,
the
justiﬁcation
for
the
notation
“

is
that
this
isomorphism
is
the
analogue
of
the

obtained
in

by
“parallel

—
i.e.,
“integrating”
—

of

along
the
“path”
σ
(where
we
think
of
σ
as
an
“element
of
the
(algebraic)
fundamental
group”
ΠS
).
That
is
to
say,
we
obtain
a
natural
ΠS

action
of

.
Theorem

(Crystalline

Z
The

of

on

is
compatible
with
ΞH
(cf.
Corollary
3.2;
here
the
“hat”
V
denotes
p-adic

and
the
natural
action
of
ΠS
on
GμZ
in
the
following
sense:
For

Proof.
As
in
[Mzk4],

this
follows
from
the
naturality
of
all
the

involved,
together
with
the

SHINICHI

Finally,
just
as
in
[Mzk4],
§2.2,
we
observe
that:
Theorem
3.4
allows
us
to
relate
the
“arithmetic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism”
arising
from
the
Lagrangian
Galois
action
to
the
classical
geometric
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism.
The
argument
in
the
case
p
=
2,
however,
diﬀers
somewhat
from
the
case
of
odd
p.
We
begin
as
in
[Mzk4],
§2.2.
Let
Γ
⊆
Gal(Z/S)
def
be
a
subgroup
of
order
>
1.
Write
dΓ
=
|Γ|
for
the
order
of
Γ.
Thus,
dΓ
=
1
divides
2d,
and
we
have
a
natural
isomorphism
Γ
∼
=
(Z/dΓ
Z)(1).
Write
(p
·
A
⊆)
mΓ

A
for
the
ideal
generated
by
elements
of
the
form
1
−
ζ,
where
ζ
is
a
dΓ
-th
root
of
unity.
Note
that
Γ
acts
trivially
on
Z
⊗
(A/mΓ
)
(mod
mΓ
).
Moreover,
we
have
a
homomorphism
λΓ
:
μdΓ
(A)
→
mΓ
/m2Γ
given
by
ζ
→
ζ
−
1
(mod
m2Γ
).
Thus,
if
we
think
of
μdΓ
(A)
as
“(Z/dΓ
Z)(1)”
(which
is
naturally
isomorphic
to
Γ),
then
we
see
that
λΓ
deﬁnes
a
homomorphism
δΓ
:
Γ
→
mΓ
/m2Γ
which
is
easily
seen
(by
the
deﬁnition
of
the
ideal
mΓ
)
to
induce
an
injection
Γ
⊗
(Z/pZ)
→
mΓ
/m2Γ
.
Next,
as
in
[Mzk4],
§2.2,
we
would
like
to
consider
a
“certain
crucial
portion”
of
the
“arithmetic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism”
associated
to
the
Lagrangian
Galois
action.
Ultimately,
however,
this
crucial
portion
in
the
case
of
p
=
2
will
diﬀer
somewhat
from
the
crucial
portion
in
the
case
of
p
odd.
HZ
via
the
Lagrangian
Galois
action
Let
γ
∈
Γ.
Then
since
γ
acts
on
HDR
HZ
HZ
→
HDR
.
If
(Deﬁnition
3.3,
Corollary
3.5),
we
see
that
γ
deﬁnes
a

HZ

we
restrict
this

and
compose
with
the

we
thus
obtain

{HDR

§2.2,
deﬁnes

i.e.,
we
get

·
τE⊗2
⊗A
mΓ
/m2Γ
.
Just
as
in
[Mzk4],
§2.2,
this
section
HZ
describes
how
the
moduli
of
EHZ
are
aﬀected
modulo
m2Γ
by
the
action
of
γ
—
i.e.,
(up
to
the
factor
of
12
)
it
is
the
usual
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
(cf.
[Mzk3],
Theorem
8.1)
of
the
family
EHZ
→
Z.
On
the
other
hand,
since
the
q-parameter
of
EHZ
is
equal
(up
to
multiplication
by
a
2d-root
of
unity)
to
1
1
q
d
=
(q
2N
·d
)2N
if
follows
that
the
eﬀect
of
γ
on
the
moduli
of
EHZ
may
be
computed
as
follows:
1
1
1
γ(q
2N
·d
)
≡
q
2N
·d
+
δΓ
(γ)
·
q
2N
·d
(mod
m2Γ
)
hence
1

1

γ(q

)
≡
q
d
+
2N
·
δΓ
(γ)
·
q
d
≡
q
d
(mod
m2Γ
)
i.e.,
the
moduli
of
EHZ
are
unaﬀected
by
γ.
In
particular,
we
see
that
the
morphism
HZ
HZ
HZ
F
1
(HDR
)
→
{HDR
/F
2
(HDR
)}
⊗A
(A/m2Γ
)
considered
above
is
identically
zero.
Thus,
in
summary,
we
see
that,
in
the
present
context,
the
action
of
γ
determines
a
morphism
HZ
HZ

F

=
F

⊗
τEHZ
⊗A
mΓ

i.e.,
by
letting
γ
vary
(as
in
[Mzk4],
§2.2),
we
obtain
a
homomorphism:
HZ

)
=
τEHZ
⊗
mΓ
/m2Γ
arising
from
the

taken
modulo
m2Γ

If
we
regard
κΓ

an

∈
Hom(Γ,
τEHZ
⊗
mΓ
/m2Γ
)
=
Hom(Γ,

then
it
follows
immediately
from
the
discussion
(in

of

of
Grifﬁths

in
[Mzk3],
§8.1
(specialized
to

Moreover,
since

deﬁned
by
some

(cf.
the
proof
of
Proposition
3.1,
together
with
the

i.e.,

we

that
the

given
by

and,
in

we
use

We
summarize
this
discussion
as
follows:
Corollary

Let
(Relation

This

Γ
gives
rise
to
a

(minimal
among

modulo
which
Γ
acts
trivially
on

)
and
a

/m2Γ

(deﬁned
by
considering
the

).
Then
the

obtained
purely
from

(cf.

by
restricting
this

to

(HDR

and
then
reducing
modulo
m2Γ
coincides
with
the
morphism
obtained
by
evaluating
the
“geometric

Moreover,
if
we
trivialize

via
this

and
∂
(where
U
is
the
standard

via
the

tive
coordinate
on
the
copy
of
Gm
that
naturally
uniformizes
EHZ
),
then
κLH
is
the
identity
morphism
modulo
mΓ
.
Thus,
in
summary,
the
arithmetic
Kodaira-Spencer
morphism
associated
to
the
Lagrangian

action
in
the
case
p
=
2
coincides
modulo
m2Γ
with
the
usual

morphism
of
the

under
consideration.
Remark.
Just
as
in
[Mzk4],
§2.2,
the
correspondence
between
the
logarithmic
tan∂
gent
direction
∈
(ΩZ
log
/A
)∨
and
the
morphism
δΓ
is
essentially
the
same

∂log(q

)
as
the
correspondence
arising
from
Faltings’
theory
of
almost
étale

the
logarithmic
tangent

of
