In
the
display
of
the
paragraph
immediately
following
Deﬁnition
1.1.10,
“ζ(j)”
should
read
“ζ(i)”.
(2.)
In
Proposition
2.1.1,
(ii),
“Loc(X)”
should
read
“Loc(X
)”.
In
Proposition
2.2.2,
(ii),
“LocQ
(X)”
should
read
“LocQ
(X
)”.

(4.)
In
Deﬁnition
2.3.1,
the
word
“irreducible”
should
read
“connected”.
(5.)
In
Proposition
2.3.5,
(i)
(respectively,
(ii)),
it
should
be
assumed
that
the
fundamental
group
of
every
connected
component
of
Q
(respectively,
Q)
is
countably
(topologically)
generated
—
cf.
Deﬁnition
2.3.1.
(6.)
In
Proposition
2.3.5,
(vi),
it
should
be
assumed
that
X
is
connected.
Moreover,
degX
is
only
deﬁned
on
(nonempty)
connected
objects
of
Loc(X
)
and
in
fact
may
be
extended
so
as
to
be
deﬁned
on
(nonempty)
connected
objects
of
Loc(X
).
(7.)
In
Proposition
2.3.6,
(i)
(respectively,
(iii)),
it
should
be
assumed
that
Isog(G)
(respectively,
A)
is
countably
(topologically)
generated
—
cf.
Deﬁnition
2.3.1.
(8.)
In
the
situation
of
Proposition
2.3.6,
we
observe
that
it
is
easily
veriﬁed
that
the
natural
inclusion
G
→
Isog(G)
is
relatively
slim,
and
hence
that
Isog(G)
is
slim
whenever
it
is
proﬁnite
(i.e.,
as
in
the
situation
of
Proposition
2.3.6,
(i)).
