BOGOMOLOV’S PROOF OF THE GEOMETRIC VERSION
OF THE SZPIRO CONJECTURE FROM THE POINT OF
VIEW OF INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY

Abstract.
The purpose of the present paper is to expose, in substantial detail,
certain remarkable similarities between inter-universal Teichmüller theory
and the theory surrounding Bogomolov’s proof of the geometric version of the
Szpiro Conjecture. These similarities are, in some sense, consequences of the fact
that both theories are closely related to the hyperbolic geometry of the classical
upper half-plane. We also discuss various diﬀerences between the theories, which
are closely related to the conspicuous absence in Bogomolov’s proof of Gaussian
distributions and theta functions, i.e., which play a central role in inter-universal
Teichmüller theory.

Introduction
Certain aspects of the inter-universal Teichmüller theory developed in [IUTchI],
[IUTchII], [IUTchIII], [IUTchIV] — namely,
(IU1) the geometry of Θ±ell NF-Hodge theaters [cf. [IUTchI], Deﬁnition
6.13; [IUTchI], Remark 6.12.3],
(IU2) the precise relationship between arithmetic degrees — i.e., of q-pilot
and Θ-pilot objects — given by the Θ×μ
LGP -link [cf. [IUTchIII], Deﬁnition
3.8, (i), (ii); [IUTchIII], Remark 3.10.1, (ii)], and
(IU3) the estimates of log-volumes of certain subsets of log-shells that give
rise to diophantine inequalities [cf. [IUTchIV], §1, §2; [IUTchIII], Remark 3.10.1, (iii)] such as the Szpiro Conjecture
— are substantially reminiscent of the theory surrounding Bogomolov’s proof
of the geometric version of the Szpiro Conjecture, as discussed in [ABKP],

[Zh]. Put another way, these aspects of inter-universal Teichmüller theory may
be thought of as arithmetic analogues of the geometric theory surrounding Bogomolov’s proof. Alternatively, Bogomolov’s proof may be thought of as a sort of
useful elementary guide, or blueprint [perhaps even a sort of Rosetta stone!],
for understanding substantial portions of inter-universal Teichmüller theory. The
author would like to express his gratitude to Ivan Fesenko for bringing to his attention, via numerous discussions in person, e-mails, and skype conversations between
December 2014 and January 2015, the possibility of the existence of such fascinating
connections between Bogomolov’s proof and inter-universal Teichmüller theory.
After reviewing, in §1, §2, §3, the theory surrounding Bogomolov’s proof from
a point of view that is somewhat closer to inter-universal Teichmüller theory than
the point of view of [ABKP], [Zh], we then proceed, in §4, §5, to compare, by highlighting various similarities and diﬀerences, Bogomolov’s proof with inter-universal
Teichmüller theory. In a word, the similarities between the two theories revolve
around the relationship of both theories to the classical elementary geometry of
the upper half-plane, while the diﬀerences between the two theories are closely
related to the conspicuous absence in Bogomolov’s proof of Gaussian distributions and theta functions, i.e., which play a central role in inter-universal
Teichmüller theory.
Section 1: The Geometry Surrounding Bogomolov’s Proof
First, we begin by reviewing the geometry surrounding Bogomolov’s proof,
albeit from a point of view that is somewhat more abstract and conceptual than
that of [ABKP], [Zh].
We denote by M the complex analytic moduli stack of elliptic curves [i.e.,
one-dimensional complex tori]. Let

there is a natural embedding
ωM → EM ⊗R C
[cf. the inclusion “ω → E” of [IUTchI], Remark 4.3.3, (ii)]. Moreover, this natural
embedding, together with the natural symplectic form

on EM [i.e., determined by the cup product on the singular cohomology of ﬁbers
over M, together with the orientation that arises from the complex holomorphic
structure on these ﬁbers], gives rise to a natural metric [cf. the discussion of
[IUTchI], Remark 4.3.3, (ii)] on ωM . Write

Next, observe that the natural section 12 · tr(−) : C → R [i.e., one-half the trace
map of the Galois extension C/R] of the natural inclusion R → C determines a
section EM ⊗R C → EM of the natural inclusion EM → EM ⊗R C whose restriction

Next, let us write E for the ﬁber [which is noncanonically isomorphic to R2 ] of

open subset D∠ ⊆ E ∠ such that D∠ maps injectively to E |∠| , while D maps

surjectively to E |∠| . Thus, ±D [i.e., the {±1}-orbit of D ] is equal to E ∠ . Then
∠
the volume of D relative to metrics on E ∠ of the sort just discussed is always

equal to π, while the volume of ±D [i.e., E ∠ ] relative to such a metric is always
equal to 2π.

Next, let us recall that the R-vector space E is equipped with a natural Z-lattice

SL(EZ ) is noncanonically isomorphic to SL2 (Z)], hence also a subgroup SL(E

In particular, if we use the generator −2πi ∈ C to identify π1 (C× ) with Z, then

Section 3: Estimates of Displacements Subject to Indeterminacies
We conclude our review of Bogomolov’s proof by brieﬂy recalling the key points
of the argument applied in this proof. These key points revolve around estimates
of displacements that are subject to certain indeterminacies.

for the group of self-homeomorphisms R≥0 → R≥0 that stabilize and restrict to the
identity on the subset π · N ⊆ R≥0 and R|π| for the set of Autπ (R≥0 )-orbits of R≥0
[relative to the natural action of Autπ (R≥0 ) on R≥0 ]. Thus, one veriﬁes easily that
R|π| =

— where we use the notation “[−]” to denote the element in R|π| determined by
an element or nonempty subset of R≥0 that lies in a single Autπ (R≥0 )-orbit. In
particular, we observe that the natural order relation on R≥0 induces a natural

natural inclusions determine an isomorphism

The key observations that underlie Bogomolov’s proof may be summarized
as follows [cf. [Zh], Lemmas 3.6 and 3.7]:
(B1) Every unipotent element τ ∈ SL(E) lifts uniquely to an element

Observation (B1) follows immediately, in light of the various deﬁnitions in
volved, together with the fact that τ|| belongs to the center of the group SL(E),
from the fact τ ﬁxes the [distinct!] images in E ∠ of ±v ∈ E for some nonzero v ∈ E.
def

Next, let us write |SL(E)| = SL(E)/{±1}. Then observe that since the gen


mined by the respective images |α|, |β| ∈ |SL(E)| of α
, β ∈ SL(E).
Now recall [cf.
the proof of [Zh], Lemma 3.5] that it follows immediately from an elementary linear
algebra argument — i.e., consideration of a solution “x” to the equation



det ac db − 10 x1

associated to an element ac db ∈ SL2 (R) such that c = 0 — that every element
of SL(E) other than −1 ∈ SL(E) may be written as a product of two unipotent
 =
elements of SL(E). In particular, we conclude that every commutator [
α, β]
(
α · β · α

τ1 · τ2 · τ2∗ · τ1∗

of four minimal liftings “
τ ” as in (B1) such that τ1∗ , τ2∗ are SL(E)-conjugate
to
−1
−1
τ1 , τ2 , respectively. On the other hand, it follows immediately from the fact
that the action on E ∠ of any nontrivial [i.e., = 1] unipotent element of SL(E)
has precisely two ﬁxed points [i.e., precisely one {±1}-orbit of ﬁxed points] that,
for i = 1, 2, there exists an element i ∈ {±1} such that, relative to the action of
∼

SL(E)
on (E ∠ )∼ → R, τii maps every element x ∈ R to an element R  τii (x) ≥ x.
[Indeed, consider the continuity properties of the map R  x → τi (x)−x ∈ R, which
is invariant with respect to translation by π in its domain!] Moreover, since any
∼

element of SL(E)

Section 4: Similarities Between the Two Theories
We are now in a position to reap the beneﬁts of the formulation of Bogomolov’s
proof given above, which is much closer “culturally” to inter-universal Teichmüller
theory than the formulation of [ABKP], [Zh].
We begin by considering the relationship between Bogomolov’s proof and
(IU1), i.e., the theory of Θ±ell NF-Hodge theaters, as developed in [IUTchI].
First of all, Bogomolov’s proof clearly centers around the hyperbolic geometry
of the upper half-plane. This aspect of Bogomolov’s proof is directly reminiscent
of the detailed analogy discussed in [IUTchI], Remark 6.12.3; [IUTchI], Fig. 6.4,
between the structure of Θ±ell NF-Hodge theaters and the classical geometry of the
upper half-plane — cf., e.g., the discussion of the natural identiﬁcation of E |∠| with
 of M
 in §1; the discussion of the boundary of the upper half-plane
the boundary ∂ M
in [IUTchI], Remark 6.12.3, (iii). In particular, one may think of
±ell
NF-Hodge theater as
the additive F±
l -symmetry portion of a Θ
corresponding to the unipotent transformations τ∞ , τ0 , γi

that appear in Bogomolov’s proof and of

12

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI
±ell
the multiplicative F
NF-Hodge theater
l -symmetry portion of a Θ
as corresponding to the toral/“typically non-unipotent” transformations τ∞ · τ0 , αi , βi

that appear in Bogomolov’s proof, i.e., typically as products of two non-commuting
unipotent transformations [cf. the proof of (B2)!]. Here, we recall that the notation
F±
denotes the semi-direct product group Fl {±1} [relative to the natural action
l
of {±1} on the underlying additive group of Fl ], while the notation F
l denotes the
×
quotient of the multiplicative group Fl by the action of {±1}.
One central aspect of the theory of Θ±ell NF-Hodge theaters developed in
[IUTchI] lies in the goal of somehow “simulating” a situation in which the module
of l-torsion points of the given elliptic curve over a number ﬁeld admits a “global
multiplicative subspace” [cf. the discussion of [IUTchI], §I1; [IUTchI], Remark
4.3.1]. One way to understand this sort of “simulated” situation is in terms of
the one-dimensional additive geometry associated to a nontrivial unipotent
transformation. That is to say, whereas, from an a priori point of view, the onedimensional additive geometries associated to conjugate, non-commuting unipotent
transformations are distinct and incompatible, the “simulation” under consideration may be understood as consisting of the establishment of some sort of geometry in which these distinct, incompatible one-dimensional additive geometries are
somehow “identiﬁed” with one another as a single, uniﬁed one-dimensional
additive geometry. This fundamental aspect of the theory of Θ±ell NF-Hodge
theaters in [IUTchI] is thus reminiscent of the
∼

∼

single, uniﬁed one-dimensional objects E ∠ ( → S1 ), (E ∠ )∼ ( → R)
in Bogomolov’s proof which admit natural actions by conjugate, non-commuting
unipotent transformations ∈ SL(E) [i.e., such as τ∞ , τ0 ] and their minimal liftings

to SL(E)
[i.e., such as τ∞ , τ0 — cf. (B1)].
The issue of simulation of a “global multiplicative subspace” as discussed in
[IUTchI], Remark 4.3.1, is closely related to the application of absolute anabelian
geometry as developed in [AbsTopIII], i.e., to the issue of establishing global arithmetic analogues for number ﬁelds of the classical theories of analytic continuation and Kähler metrics, constructed via the use of logarithms, on hyperbolic
Riemann surfaces [cf. [IUTchI], Remarks 4.3.2, 4.3.3, 5.1.4]. These aspects of
inter-universal Teichmüller theory are, in turn, closely related [cf. the discussion
of [IUTchI], Remark 4.3.3] to the application in [IUTchIII] of the theory of logshells [cf. (IU3)] as developed in [AbsTopIII] to the task of constructing multiradial mono-analytic containers, as discussed in the Introductions to [IUTchIII],
[IUTchIV]. These multradial mono-analytic containers play the crucial role of furnishing containers for the various objects of interest — i.e., the theta value and
global number ﬁeld portions of Θ-pilot objects — that, although subject to various indeterminacies [cf. the discussion of the indeterminacies (Ind1), (Ind2),
(Ind3) in the Introduction to [IUTchIII]], allow one to obtain the estimates [cf.
[IUTchIII], Remark 3.10.1, (iii)] of these objects of interest as discussed in detail
in [IUTchIV], §1, §2 [cf., especially, the proof of [IUTchIV], Theorem 1.10]. These
aspects of inter-universal Teichmüller theory may be thought of as corresponding to
∼
the essential use of (E ∠ )∼ ( → R) in Bogomolov’s proof, i.e., which is reminiscent of
the log-shells that appear in inter-universal Teichmüller theory in many respects:

BOGOMOLOV’S PROOF AND INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY
 ∼
(L1) The object (ωM
) that appears in Bogomolov’s proof may be thought
of as corresponding to the holomorphic log-shells of inter-universal
Teichmüller theory, i.e., in the sense that it may be thought of as a sort of
“logarithm” of the “holomorphic family of copies of the group of
units S1 ” consituted by ω  — cf. the discussion of variation of complex

M
structure in §1.

M
phically [cf. Fig. 1] to (E ∠ )∼ , an essentially real analytic object that is
independent of the varying complex structures discussed in (L1), hence
may be thought of as corresponding to the mono-analytic log-shells of
inter-universal Teichmüller theory.
(L3) Just as in the case of the mono-analytic log-shells of inter-universal Teichmüller theory [cf., especially, the proof of [IUTchIV], Theorem 1.10],
(E ∠ )∼ serves as a container for estimating the various objects of interest in Bogomolov’s proof, as discussed in (B1), (B2), objects which are
subject to the indeterminacies constituted by the action of Autπ (R),
Autπ (R≥0 ) [cf. the indeterminacies (Ind1), (Ind2), (Ind3) in inter-universal
Teichmüller theory].
(L4) In the context of the estimates of (L3), the estimates of unipotent transformations given in (B1) may be thought of as corresponding to the estimates involving theta values in inter-universal Teichmüller theory, while
the estimates of “typically non-unipotent” transformations given in
(B2) may be thought of as corresponding to the estimates involving global
number ﬁeld portions of Θ-pilot objects in inter-universal Teichmüller
theory.
(L5) As discussed in the [IUTchI], §I1, the Kummer theory surrounding the
theta values is closely related to the additive symmetry portion of
a Θ±ell NF-Hodge theater, i.e., in which global synchronization of ±indeterminacies [cf. [IUTchI], Remark 6.12.4, (iii)] plays a fundamental
role. Moreover, as discussed in [IUTchIII], Remark 2.3.3, (vi), (vii), (viii),
the essentially local nature of the cyclotomic rigidity isomorphisms
that appear in the Kummer theory surrounding the theta values renders
them free of any ±-indeterminacies. These phenomena of rigidity
with respect to ±-indeterminacies in inter-universal Teichmüller theory
are highly reminiscent of the crucial estimate of (B1) involving
the volume π of a fundamental domain D

∠

for the action of {±1} on E ∠ [i.e., as opposed to the volume 2π of the {±1∠
∠
orbit ±D of D !], as well as of the uniqueness of the minimal liftings
of (B1). In this context, we also recall that the additive symmetry portion
of a Θ±ell NF-Hodge theater, which depends, in an essential way, on the
global synchronization of ±-indeterminacies [cf. [IUTchI], Remark 6.12.4,
(iii)], is used in inter-universal Teichmüller theory to establish conjugate
synchronization, which plays an indispensable role in the construction
of bi-coric mono-analytic log-shells [cf. [IUTchIII], Remark 1.5.1].
This state of aﬀairs is highly reminiscent of the important role played by
E ∠ , as opposed to E |∠| = E ∠ /{±1}, in Bogomolov’s proof.

(L6) As discussed in the [IUTchI], §I1, the Kummer theory surrounding the
number ﬁelds under consideration is closely related to the multiplicative symmetry portion of a Θ±ell NF-Hodge theater, i.e., in which one
always works with quotients via the action of ±1. Moreover, as discussed in [IUTchIII], Remark 2.3.3, (vi), (vii), (viii) [cf. also [IUTchII],
Remark 4.7.3, (i)], the essentially global nature — which necessarily involves at least two localizations, corresponding to a valuation [say, “0”]
and the corresponding inverse valuation [i.e., “∞”] of a function ﬁeld
— of the cyclotomic rigidity isomorphisms that appear in the Kummer theory surrounding number ﬁelds causes them to be subject to ±indeterminacies. These ±-indeterminacy phenomena in inter-universal
Teichmüller theory are highly reminiscent of the crucial estimate of (B2) —
which arises from considering products of two non-commuting unipotent transformations, i.e., corresponding to “two distinct localizations”
— involving
∠

the volume 2π of the {±1}-orbit ±D of a fundamental domain D

∠

∠

for the action of {±1} on E ∠ [i.e., as opposed to the volume π of D !].
(L7) The analytic continuation aspect [say, from “∞” to “0”] of interuniversal Teichmüller theory — i.e., via the technique of Belyi cuspidalization as discussed in [IUTchI], Remarks 4.3.2, 5.1.4 — may be thought
of as corresponding to the “analytic continuation” inherent in the holo ∼
) ”, which relates,
morphic structure of the “holomorphic log-shell (ωM
in particular, the localizations at the cusps “∞” and “0”.
Here, we note in passing that one way to understand certain aspects of the
phenomena discussed in (L4), (L5), and (L6) is in terms of the following “general
principle”: Let k be an algebraically closed ﬁeld. Write k × for the multiplicative
def
group of nonzero elements of k, P GL2 (k) = GL2 (k)/k × . Thus, by thinking in
terms of fractional linear transformations, one may regard P GL2 (k) as the group
def

of k-automorphisms of the projective line P = P1k over k. We shall say that an
element of P GL2 (k) is unipotent if it arises from a unipotent element of GL2 (k).
Let ξ ∈ P GL2 (k) be a nontrivial element. Write P ξ for the set of k-rational points
of P that are ﬁxed by ξ. Then observe that
ξ is unipotent ⇐⇒ P ξ is of cardinality one;
ξ is non-unipotent ⇐⇒ P ξ is of cardinality two.
That is to say,
General Principle:
· A nontrivial unipotent element ξ ∈ P GL2 (k) may be regarded as
expressing a local geometry, i.e., the geometry in the neighborhood
of a single point [namely, the unique ﬁxed point of ξ]. Such a “local
geometry” — that is to say, more precisely, the set P ξ of cardinality one
— does not admit a “reﬂection, or ±-, symmetry”.

· By contrast, a nontrivial non-unipotent element ξ ∈ P GL2 (k) may
be regarded as expressing a global geometry, i.e., the “toral” geometry
corresponding to a pair of points “0” and “∞” [namely, the two ﬁxed
points of ξ]. Such a “global toral geometry” — that is to say, more precisely, the set P ξ of cardinality two — typically does admit a “reﬂection,
or ±-, symmetry” [i.e., which permutes the two points of P ξ ].

Next, we recall that the suitability of the multiradial mono-analytic containers
furnished by log-shells for explicit estimates [cf. [IUTchIII], Remark 3.10.1,
(iii)] lies in sharp contrast to the precise, albeit somewhat tautological, nature
of the correspondence [cf. (IU2)] concerning arithmetic degrees of objects of
interest [i.e., q-pilot and Θ-pilot objects] given by the Θ×μ
LGP -link [cf. [IUTchIII],
Deﬁnition 3.8, (i), (ii); [IUTchIII], Remark 3.10.1, (ii)]. This precise correspondence
is reminiscent of the precise, but relatively “superﬁcial” [i.e., by comparison to
the estimates (B1), (B2)], relationships concerning degrees [cf. (B4)] that arise from
the homomorphism χ [i.e., which is denoted “deg” in [Zh]!]. On the other hand, the
ﬁnal estimate (B5) requires one to apply both the precise computation of (B4) and
the nontrivial estimates of (B1), (B2). This state of aﬀairs is highly reminiscent
of the discussion surrounding [IUTchIII], Fig. I.8, of two equivalent ways to
compute log-volumes, i.e., the precise correspondence furnished by the Θ×μ
LGP -link
and the nontrivial estimates via the multiradial mono-analytic containers furnished
by the log-shells.
Finally, we observe that the complicated interplay between “Frobenius-like”
and “étale-like” objects in inter-universal Teichmüller theory may be thought of
as corresponding to the complicated interplay in Bogomolov’s proof between
complex holomorphic objects such as the holomorphic line bundle

— i.e., which correspond to étale-like objects in inter-universal Teichmüller theory.
The analogies discussed above are summarized in Fig. 5 above.
Section 5: Diﬀerences Between the Two Theories
In a word, the most essential diﬀerence between inter-universal Teichmüller
theory and Bogomolov’s proof appears to lie in the
absence in Bogomolov’s proof of
Gaussian distributions and theta functions,
i.e., which play a central role in inter-universal Teichmüller theory.

BOGOMOLOV’S PROOF AND INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY

17

In some sense, Bogomolov’s proof may be regarded as arising from the geometry surrounding the natural symplectic form
def

 - , -  E =  - , -  E |E
on the two-dimensional R-vector space E. The natural arithmetic analogue of
this symplectic form is the Weil pairing on the torsion points — i.e., such as the
l-torsion points that appear in inter-universal Teichmüller theory — of an elliptic
curve over a number ﬁeld.
On the other hand, one fundamental diﬀerence between this Weil pairing on
torsion points and the symplectic form  - , - E is the following:
Whereas the ﬁeld R over which the symplectic form  - , - E is deﬁned
may be regarded as a subﬁeld — i.e.,
∃ R → C
— of the ﬁeld of deﬁnition C of the algebraic schemes [or stacks] under
consideration, the ﬁeld Fl over which the Weil pairing on l-torsion points
is deﬁned cannot be regarded as a subﬁeld — i.e.,
 Fl → Q
— of the number ﬁeld over which the [algebraic] elliptic curve under consideration is deﬁned.
This phenomenon of compatibility/incompatibility of ﬁelds of deﬁnition is reminiscent of the “mysterious tensor products” that occur in p-adic Hodge theory,
i.e., in which the “Zp ” that acts on a p-adic Tate module is identiﬁed [despite its
somewhat alien nature!] with the “Zp ” that includes as a subring of the structure
sheaf of the p-adic scheme under consideration [cf. the discussion of [HASurII],
Remark 3.7; the ﬁnal portion of [EtTh], Remark 2.16.2; [IUTchI], Remarks 4.3.1,
4.3.2; [IUTchI], Remark 6.12.3, (i), (ii); [IUTchIV], Remark 3.3.2]. Here, we observe
further that the former “Zp ”, as well as the ﬁelds of deﬁnition of the symplectic
form  - , - E and the Weil pairing on torsion points, are, from the point of view
of inter-universal Teichmüller theory, étale-like objects, whereas the latter “Zp ”,
as well as other instances of subrings of the structure sheaf of the scheme under
consideration, are Frobenius-like objects. That is to say, the point of view of
inter-universal Teichmüller theory may be summarized as follows:
Certain geometric aspects — i.e., aspects that, in eﬀect, correspond to
the geometry of the classical upper half-plane [cf. [IUTchI], Remark
6.12.3] — of the a priori incompatibility of ﬁelds of deﬁnition in the
case of elliptic curves over number ﬁelds are, in some sense, overcome in inter-universal Teichmüller theory by applying various absolute
anabelian algorithms to pass from étale-like to Frobenius-like objects,
as well as various cyclotomic rigidity algorithms to pass, via Kummer theory, from Frobenius-like to étale-like objects.
Indeed, as discussed in [IUTchI], Remarks 4.3.1, 4.3.2, it is precisely this circle of
ideas that forms the starting point for the construction of Θ±ell NF-Hodge theaters
given in [IUTchI], by applying the absolute anabelian geometry of [AbsTopIII].

18

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

One way to understand the gap between ﬁelds of deﬁnition of ﬁrst cohomology
modules or modules of torsion points, on the one hand, and the ﬁeld of deﬁnition
of the given base scheme, on the other, is to think of elements of ﬁelds/rings of
the former sort as objects that occur as exponents of regular functions on the
base scheme, i.e., elements of rings that naturally contain ﬁelds/rings of the latter
sort. For instance, this sort of situation may be seen at a very explicit level by
consider the powers of the q-parameter that occur in the theory of Tate curves
over p-adic ﬁelds [cf. the discussion of the ﬁnal portion of [EtTh], Remark 2.16.2].
From this point of view, the approach of inter-universal Teichmüller theory may be
summarized as follows:
Certain function-theoretic aspects of the a priori incompatibility of ﬁelds
of deﬁnition in the case of elliptic curves over number ﬁelds are, in
some sense, overcome in inter-universal Teichmüller theory by working
with Gaussian distributions and theta functions, i.e., which may be
regarded, in eﬀect, as exponentiations of the symplectic form  - , - E
that appears in Bogomolov’s proof.
Indeed, it is precisely as a result of such exponentation operations that one is obliged
to work, in inter-universal Teichmüller theory, with arbitrary iterates of the
log-link [cf. the theory of [AbsTopIII], [IUTchIII]; the discussion of [IUTchIII],
Remark 1.2.2] in order to relate and indeed identify, in eﬀect, the function theory
of exponentiated objects with the function theory of non-exponentiated objects. This
situation diﬀers somewhat from the single application of the logarithm constituted
by the covering (E ∠ )∼  E ∠ in Bogomolov’s proof.
So far in the present §5, our discussion has centered around
· the geometry of Θ±ell NF-Hodge theaters [as discussed in [IUTchI],
§4, §5, §6] and
· the multiradial representation via mono-analytic log-shells [cf.
[IUTchIII], Theorem 3.11, (i), (ii)]
of inter-universal Teichmüller theory, which correspond, respectively, to the symplectic geometry of the upper half-plane [cf. §1] and the δ sup estimates [cf.
(B1), (B2)] of Bogomolov’s proof.
On the other hand, the degree computations via the homomorphism χ, which
arises, in essence, by considering the discriminant modular form, also play a
key role [cf. (B4)] in Bogomolov’s proof. One may think of this aspect of Bogomolov’s proof as consisting of the application of the discriminant modular form
to relate the symplectic geometry discussed in §1 — cf., especially, the natural
SL(E)-torsor structure on ω  — to the conventional algebraic theory of line

M
bundles and divisors on the algebraic stack M. In particular, this aspect of Bogomolov’s proof is reminiscent of the Θ×μ
LGP -link, i.e., which serves to relate the
“Gaussian distributions” [that is to say, “exponentiated symplectic forms”] that
appear in the multiradial representation via mono-analytic log-shells to the conventional theory of arithmetic line bundles on the number ﬁeld under consideration.
We remark in passing that this state of aﬀairs is reminiscent of the point of view
discussed in [HASurI], §1.2, §1.3.2, to the eﬀect that the constructions of schemetheoretic Hodge-Arakelov theory [i.e., which may be regarded as a sort of schemetheoretic precursor of inter-universal Teichmüller theory] may be thought of as a

BOGOMOLOV’S PROOF AND INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY

19

sort of function-theoretic vector bundle version of the discrimant modular form. The
Θ×μ
LGP -link is not compatible with the various ring/scheme structures — i.e.,
the “arithmetic holomorphic structures” — in its domain and codomain. In
order to surmount this incompatibility, one must avail oneself of the theory of multiradiality developed in [IUTchII], [IUTchIII]. The non-ring-theoretic nature of the
resulting multiradial representation via mono-analytic log-shells — cf. [IUTchIII],
Theorem 3.11, (i), (ii); the discussion of inter-universality in [IUTchIV], Remark
3.6.3, (i) — of inter-universal Teichmüller theory may then be thought of as corresponding to the real analytic [i.e., non-holomorphic] nature of the symplectic
geometry that appears in Bogomolov’s proof. In this context, we recall that
(E1) one central feature of Bogomolov’s proof is the following fundamental
diﬀerence between the crucial estimate (B1), which arises from the [nonholomorphic] symplectic geometry portion of Bogomolov’s proof, on the
one hand, and the homomorphism χ, on the other: whereas, for integers
N ≥ 1, the homomorphism χ maps N -th powers of elements τ as in (B1)
to multiples by N of elements ∈ Z, the estimate δ sup (−) < [π] of (B1) is
unaﬀected when one replaces an element τ by such an N -th power of τ.
This central feature of Bogomolov’s proof is highly reminiscent of the situation in
inter-universal Teichmüller theory in which
(E2) although the multiradial representation of Θ-pilot objects via mono×μ
analytic log-shells in the domain of the Θ×μ
LGP -link is related, via the ΘLGP link, to q-pilot objects in the codomain of the Θ×μ
LGP -link, the same multiradial representation of the same Θ-pilot objects may related, in precisely
the same fashion, to arbitrary N -th powers of q-pilot objects, for integers N ≥ 2
[cf. the discussion of [IUTchIII], Remark 3.12.1, (ii)].
Thus, in summary, if, relative to the point of view of Bogomolov’s proof, one
· substitutes Gaussian distributions/theta functions, i.e., in essence,
exponentiations of the natural symplectic form  - , - E , for  - , - E ,
and, moreover,
· allows for arbitrary iterates of the log-link, which, in eﬀect, allow one
to “disguise” the eﬀects of such exponentiation operations,
then inter-universal Teichmüller theory bears numerous striking resemblances
to Bogomolov’s proof. Put another way, the bridge furnished by inter-universal
Teichmüller theory between the analogy discussed in detail at the beginning of §4
(A1) between the geometry surrounding E ∠ in Bogomolov’s proof and the
combinatorics involving l-torsion points that underlie the structure of
Θ±ell NF-Hodge theaters in inter-universal Teichmüller theory, on the one
hand,
and the analogy discussed extensively in (L1∼7)
(A2) between the geometry surrounding E ∠ in Bogomolov’s proof and the
holomorphic/mono-analytic log-shells — i.e., in essence, the local
unit groups associated to various completions of a number ﬁeld — that
occur in inter-universal Teichmüller theory, on the other

20

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

— i.e., the bridge between l-torsion points and log-shells — may be understood as
consisting of the following apparatus of inter-universal Teichmüller theory:
(GE) l-torsion points [cf. (A1)] are, as discussed above, closely related to
exponents of functions, such as theta functions or algebraic rational
functions [cf. the discussion of [IUTchIII], Remark 2.3.3, (vi), (vii), (viii);
[IUTchIII], Figs. 2.5, 2.6, 2.7]; such functions give rise, via the operation of
Galois evaluation [cf. [IUTchIII], Remark 2.3.3, (i), (ii), (iii)], to theta
values and elements of number ﬁelds, which one regards as acting on
log-shells [cf. (A2)] that are constructed in a situation in which one
considers arbitrary iterates of the log-link [cf. [IUTchIII], Fig. I.6].
In the context of the analogies (A1), (A2), it is also of interest to observe that
the multiradial containers that are ultimately used in inter-universal Teichmüller
theory [cf. [IUTchIII], Fig. I.6; [IUTchIII], Theorem A] consist of processions of
mono-analytic log-shells, i.e., collections of mono-analytic log shells whose labels
essentially correspond to the elements of |Fl | [i.e., the quotient of the set Fl by
the natural action of {±1}]. This observation is especially of interest in light of the
following aspects of inter-universal Teichmüller theory:
(P1) in inter-universal Teichmüller theory, the prime l is regarded as being sufﬁciently large that the ﬁnite ﬁeld Fl serves as a “good approximation”
for Z [cf. [IUTchI], Remark 6.12.3, (i)];
(P2) at each nonarchimedean prime at which the elliptic curve over a number
ﬁeld under consideration has stable bad reduction, the copy of “Z” that
is approximated by Fl may be naturally identiﬁed with the value group
associated to the nonarchimedean prime [cf. [IUTchII], Remark 4.7.3, (i)];
(P3) at each archimedean prime of the number ﬁeld over which the elliptic
curve under consideration is deﬁned, a mono-analytic log-shell essentially
corresponds to a closed ball of radius π, centered at the origin in a Euclidean space of dimension two and subject to ±-indeterminacies [cf.
[IUTchIII], Proposition 1.2, (vii); [IUTchIII], Remark 1.2.2, (ii)].
That is to say, if one thinks in terms of the correspondences
mono-analytic log-shells
procession labels ∈ |Fl | ( Fl ≈ Z)

←→
←→

E ∠ (∼
= S1 ),
∼
Z · π → Aut((E ∠ )∼ /E |∠| ),

then the collection of data constituted by a “procession of mono-analytic
log-shells” is substantially reminiscent of the objects (E ∠ )∼ (∼
= R), R|π| —
i.e., in essence, copies of R, R≥0 that are subject to Autπ (R)-, Autπ (R≥0 )indeterminacies — that play a central role in Bogomolov’s proof.
Before concluding, we observe that, in the context of the above discussion
of the technique of Galois evaluation [cf. (GE)], which plays an important role in
inter-universal Teichmüller theory, it is also perhaps of interest to note the following
further correspondences between the two theories:
(GE1) The multiradiality apparatus of inter-universal Teichmüller theory depends, in an essential way, on the supplementary geometric dimension
constituted by the “geometric containers” [cf. [IUTchIII], Remark 2.3.3,
(i), (ii)] furnished by theta functions and algebraic rational functions,

BOGOMOLOV’S PROOF AND INTER-UNIVERSAL TEICHMÜLLER THEORY

21

which give rise, via Galois evaluation, to the theta values and elements
of number ﬁelds that act directly on processions of mono-analytic logshells. That is to say, this multiradiality apparatus would collapse if one
attempted to work with these theta values and elements of number ﬁelds
directly. This state of aﬀairs is substantially reminiscent of the fact that,
in Bogomolov’s proof, it does not suﬃce to work directly with actions of
[unipotent or toral/non-unipotent] elements of SL(E) (∼
= SL2 (R)) on E ∠ ;
that is to say, it is of essential importance that one work with liftings to

SL(E)
of these elements of SL(E), i.e., to make use of the supplementary
×
→ M.
geometric dimension constituted by the bundle ωM
(GE2) The fact that the theory of Galois evaluation surrounding theta values plays a somewhat more central, prominent role in inter-universal Teichmüller theory [cf. [IUTchII], §1, §2, §3; [IUTchIII], §2] than the theory
of Galois evaluation surrounding number ﬁelds is reminiscent of the fact
that the original exposition of Bogomolov’s proof in [ABKP] essentially
treats only the case of genus zero, i.e., in eﬀect, only the central estimate
of (B1), thus allowing one to ignore the estimates concerning commutators of (B2). It is only in the later exposition of [Zh] that one can ﬁnd a
detailed treatment of the estimates of (B2).
We conclude by observing that the numerous striking resemblances discussed
above are perhaps all the more striking in light of the complete independence
of the development of inter-universal Teichmüller theory from developments surrounding Bogomolov’s proof: That is to say, the author was completely ignorant
of Bogomolov’s proof during the development of inter-universal Teichmüller theory.
Moreover, inter-universal Teichmüller theory arose not as a result of eﬀorts to “generalize Bogomolov’s proof by substituting exponentiations of  - , - E for  - , - E ”,
but rather as a result of eﬀorts [cf. the discussion of [HASurI], §1.5.1, §2.1; [EtTh],
Remarks 1.6.2, 1.6.3] to overcome obstacles to applying scheme-theoretic HodgeArakelov theory to diophantine geometry by developing some sort of arithmetic
analogue of the classical functional equation of the theta function. That is
to say, despite the fact that the starting point of such eﬀorts, namely, the classical functional equation of the theta function, was entirely absent from the theory
surrounding Bogomolov’s proof, the theory, namely, inter-universal Teichmüller theory, that ultimately arose from such eﬀorts turned out, in hindsight, as discussed
above, to be remarkably similar in numerous aspects to the theory surrounding
Bogomolov’s proof.
The content of the above discussion is summarized in Fig. 6 below. Also,
certain aspects of our discussion — which, roughly speaking, concern the respective
“estimation apparatuses” that occur in the two theories — are illustrated in
Figs. 7 and 8 below. Here, we note that the mathematical content of Fig. 8 is
essentially identical to the mathematical content of [IUTchIII], Fig. I.6 [cf. also
[IUTchI], Fig. I1.3].
