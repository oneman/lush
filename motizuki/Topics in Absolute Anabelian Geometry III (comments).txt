(1.) In Remark 5.10.2, (iv), “On the other,” should read “On the other hand,”.
(2.) In Theorem 1.11, (b), the text “totally ramiﬁed at precisely one closed point
but unramiﬁed elsewhere” should read “totally ramiﬁed at some closed point”.
(3.) In the ﬁnal sentences of Proposition 5.8, (iii), (vi), the phrase “despite the fact
one does not” should read “despite the fact that one does not”.
(4.) In Remark 3.7.5, (ii), (2), “muliplication” should read “multiplication”.
(5.) In the statement of Proposition 3.2, (iv), the phrase “if T = TM, or” should
read as follows:
“if T = TM, and (Π  MT ), (Π∗  MT∗ ) are of hyperbolic orbicurve
type, or”
In the proof of Proposition 3.2, (iv), the phrase “[cf. also the ﬁrst displayed isomorphism of Corollary 1.10, (b)]” should read as follows:
“[cf. also the ﬁrst displayed isomorphism of Corollary 1.10, (b); [Mzk20],
Theorem 2.6, (v)]”
In the statement of Proposition 3.3, (ii), the phrase “if T = TCG. If T = TLG,”
should read as follows:
“if T = TCG, and (Π  M ), (Π∗  M ∗ ) are of hyperbolic orbicurve
type. If T = TLG, and (Π  M ), (Π∗  M ∗ ) are of hyperbolic
orbicurve type,”
These changes have no eﬀect either on the subsequent discussions and results of
the paper under consideration or on subsequent papers.
