In
the
second
line
of
the
ﬁnal
display
of
Example
1.1,
(ii),
the
notation
“ord(K
×
)
⊆
Φ(K)”
should
read
“ord(K
×
)
⊆
Φ(K)gp
”.
(2.)
In
the
proof
of
Theorem
2.4,
(ii),
the
notation
“B(Gi
,
G◦i
)”
should
read
“B
temp
(Gi
,
G◦i
)”.
(3.)
In
the
display
following
the
phrase
“the
assignment”
in
Example
3.3,
(i),
the
notation
“ord(K)
∼
=
R≥0
”
should
read
=
R>0
∼
“ord(O
)
∼
=
R≥0
”.
K
Also,
in
the
explanation
following
this
display,
the
phrase
“[where
the
isomorphism
∼
R>0
→
R≥0
is
given
by
the
natural
logarithm],
then”
should
read

“[where
OK
⊆
K
×
denotes
the
multiplicative
submonoid
of
elements
of

∼
)
=
R≥0
is
given
by
minus
the
norm
≤
1,
and
the
isomorphism
ord(OK
natural
logarithm],
then”.
(4.)
The
observation
“Observe
that
all
real
objects
of
N0
are
isomorphic.”
at
the
beginning
of
Example
3.3,
(iv),
is
correct
as
stated,
but
may
be
replaced
by
the
stronger
observation
“Observe
that
all
real
objects
of
N0
are
isomorphic,
and
all
morphisms
between
such
objects
are
isomorphisms.”.
(5.)
The
following
sentence
should
be
added
to
the
end
of
Deﬁnition
3.3,
(iv):
Finally,
we
shall
refer
to
as
the
angular
region
of
an
object
of
C,
A,
N
,
or
R
the
angular
region
of
the
object
obtained
by
projecting
the
given
object
to
C0
.
(6.)
In
the
proof
of
Proposition
3.5,
(iii),
the
notation
“C
F”
should
read
“C
G[C]”.

In
the
ﬁrst
displayed
diagram
of
the
proof
of
Theorem
5.5,
the
notation
“Ψ
”
should
read
“(Ψpf
)birat
”.
(8.)
In
Example
5.6,
(iii),
(b),
the
phrase
“for
some
group-like
functor
Dv
→
Mon”
:
Dv
→
Mon”.
should
read
“for
some
group-like
functor

(9.)
In
Example
1.1,
(i),
(ii),
it
is
to
be
understood
that
ΦZ0
=
Φ0
,
BZ0
=
B0
.
(10.)
In
the
two
lines
of
the
ﬁnal
display
of
Example
1.1,
(ii),
the
notation
“Φ(K)”
should
be
replaced
by
“Φ(A)”;
the
phrase
“for
every
Spec(K)
∈
Ob(D0
),
then”
should
be
replaced
by
the
phrase
“for
every
A
∈
Ob(D),
where
we
denote
the
image
of
A
in
D0
by
Spec(K)
∈
Ob(D0
),
then”.
(11.)
In
the
notation
“AutFA
(B)”
that
appears
in
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(v),
the
“B”
is
to
be
understood
as
the
object
of
FA
determined
by
the
morphism
B
→
A
of
F.
(12.)
All
tempered
groups
[hence
also
proﬁnite
groups
that
are
regarded
as
tempered
groups]
(respectively,
all
[quasi-]temperoids)
that
appear
in
the
present
paper
should
be
assumed
to
be
equipped
with
a
topology
that
admits
a
countable
basis
(respectively,
assumed
to
be
connected
[quasi-]temperoids
associated
to
such
tempered
groups).
This
assumption
is
necessary
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
index
sets
of
“universal
covering
pro-objects”
implicit
in
the
deﬁnition
of
the
tempered
fundamental
group
associated
to
a
connected
temperoid
[cf.
[Mzk2],
Remark
3.2.1]
may
to
be
taken
to
be
countable.
This
countability
of
the
index
sets
involved
implies
that
the
various
objects
that
constitute
such
a
universal
covering
pro-object
admit
a
compatible
system
of
basepoints,
i.e.,
that
the
obstruction
to
the
existence
of
such
a
compatible
system
—
which
may
be
thought
of
as
an
element
of
a
sort
of
“nonabelian
R1
lim
←−”
—
vanishes.
In
order
to
deﬁne
the
tempered
fundamental
group
in
an
intrinsically
meaningful
fashion,
it
is
necessary
to
know
the
existence
of
such
a
compatible
system
of
basepoints.
(13.)
In
Remark
3.5.1,
the
phrase
“since,
for
instance
in
the
case
of”
should
read
“since,
for
instance,
in
the
case
of”.
(14.)
The
following
[essentially
formal]
modiﬁcations
should
be
made
to
the
proof
of
Proposition
3.4,
(viii):
(i)
In
the
fourth
paragraph
of
this
proof:
“On
the
other
hand,
β”
should
read
“On
the
other
hand,
if
β
is
not
an
isomorphism,
then
β”;
“we
conclude
that
φ”
should
read
“we
conclude
that
if
φ
is
not
an
isomorphism,
then
φ”.
(ii)
In
the
ﬁfth
paragraph
of
this
proof:
“of
FSMI-morphisms
φ1
,
.
.
.
,
φn
such
that
the
domain
of
φ
is
equal
to
A”
should
read
“of
a
morphism
φ1
whose
domain
is
equal
to
A
with
FSMI-morphisms
φ2
,
.
.
.
,
φn
”;
“If
φj
projects”
should
read
“If,
for
j
≥
2,
φj
projects”.

(iii)
In
the
sixth
paragraph
of
this
proof:
all
instances
of
the
term
“FSMImorphisms”
should
be
replaced
by
the
phrase
“FSMI-morphisms/isomorphisms
[i.e.,
morphisms
which
are
either
FSMI-morphisms
or
isomorphisms]”.
(15.)
The
following
[essentially
formal]
modiﬁcations
should
be
made
to
Defnition
5.3,
(v);
Proposition
5.4;
the
statement
and
proof
of
Theorem
5.5,
(iv):
(i)
In
Deﬁnition
5.3,
(v),
the
text
“[where
“pf”
is
deﬁned
whenever
C
is
of
Frobenius-isotropic
type]”
should
read
as
follows:
“[where
“pf”
is
deﬁned
whenever
C
is
of
Frobenius-isotropic
type;
“birat”
is
deﬁned
whenever
C
is
of
birationally
Frobenius-normalized
type]”.
(ii)
In
the
statement
and
proof
of
Proposition
5.4,
the
term
“Frobeniusnormalized”
should
be
replaced
by
the
term
“birationally
Frobenius-normalized”
(2
instances).
(iii)
In
the
statement
of
Theorem
5.5,
(iv),
the
phrase
“of
poly-non-grouplike
type”
should
read
“of
poly-non-group-like
and
poly-birationally
Frobenius-normalized
type”.
In
the
proof
of
Theorem
5.5,
the
text
“of
standard,
perfect”
should
read
“of
standard,
birationally
Frobeniusnormalized
[cf.
[Mzk5],
Proposition
3.2,
(ii)],
perfect”.
