Abstract.
Let
Σ
be
a
subset
of
the
set
of
prime
numbers
which
is
either
equal
to
the
entire
set
of
prime
numbers
or
of
cardinality
one.
In
the
present
paper,
we
continue
our
study
of
the
pro-Σ
fundamental
groups
of
hyperbolic
curves
and
their
associated
conﬁguration
spaces
over
algebraically
closed
ﬁelds
in
which
the
primes
of
Σ
are
invertible.
The
focus
of
the
present
paper
is
on
applications
of
the
theory
developed
in
previous
papers
to
the
theory
of
tempered
fundamental
groups,
in
the
style
of
André.
These
applications
are
motivated
by
the
goal
of
surmounting
two
fundamental
technical
diﬃculties
that
appear
in
previous
work
of
André,
namely:
(a)
the
fact
that
the
characterization
of
the
local
Galois
groups
in
the
global
Galois
image
associated
to
a
hyperbolic
curve
that
is
given
in
earlier
work
of
André
is
only
proven
for
a
quite
limited
class
of
hyperbolic
curves,
i.e.,
a
class
that
is
“far
from
generic”;
(b)
the
proof
given
in
earlier
work
of
André
of
a
certain
key
injectivity
result,
which
is
of
central
importance
in
establishing
the
theory
of
a
“p-adic
local
analogue”
of
the
well-known
“global”
theory
of
the
Grothendieck-Teichmüller
group,
contains
a
fundamental
gap.
In
the
present
paper,
we
surmount
these
technical
diﬃculties
by
introducing
the
notion
of
an
“M-admissible”,
or
“metric-admissible”,
outer
automorphism
of
the
proﬁnite
geometric
fundamental
group
of
a
p-adic
hyperbolic
curve.
Roughly
speaking,
M-admissible
outer
automorphisms
are
outer
automorphisms
that
are
compatible
with
the
data
constituted
by
the
indices
at
the
various
nodes
of
the
special
ﬁber
of
the
p-adic
curve
under
consideration.
By
combining
this
notion
with
combinatorial
anabelian
results
and
techniques
developed
in
earlier
papers
by
the
authors,
together
with
the
theory
of
cyclotomic
synchronization
[also
developed
in
earlier
papers
by
the
authors],
we
obtain
a
generalization
of
André’s
characterization
of
the
local
Galois
groups
in
the
global
Galois
image
associated
to
a
hyperbolic
curve
to
the
case
of
arbitrary
hyperbolic
curves
[cf.
(a)].
Moreover,
by
applying
the
theory
of
local
contractibility
of
p-adic
analytic
spaces
developed
by
Berkovich,
we
show
that
the
techniques
developed
in
the
present
and
earlier
papers
by
the
authors
allow
one
to
relate
the
groups
of
M-admissible
outer
automorphisms
treated
in
the
present
paper
to
the
groups
of
outer
automorphisms

Introduction
Let
Σ
⊆
Primes
be
a
subset
of
the
set
of
prime
numbers
Primes
which
is
either
equal
to
Primes
or
of
cardinality
one.
In
the
present
paper,
we
continue
our
study
of
the
pro-Σ
fundamental
groups
of
hyperbolic
curves
and
their
associated
conﬁguration
spaces
over
algebraically
closed
ﬁelds
in
which
the
primes
of
Σ
are
invertible
[cf.
[MzTa],
[CmbCsp],
[NodNon],
[CbTpI],
[CbTpII]].
The
focus
of
the
present
paper
is
on
applications
of
the
theory
developed
in
previous
papers
to
the
theory
of
tempered
fundamental
groups,
in
the
style
of
[André].
Just
as
in
previous
papers,
the
main
technical
result
that
underlies
our
approach
is
a
certain
combinatorial
anabelian
result
[cf.
Theorem
1.11;
Corollary
1.12],
which
may
be
summarized
as
a
generalization
of
results
obtained
in
earlier
papers
[cf.,
e.g.,
[NodNon],
Theorem
A;
[CbTpII],
Theorem
1.9]
in
the
case
of
pro-Σ
fundamental
groups
to
the
case
of
almost
pro-Σ
fundamental
groups
[i.e.,
maximal
almost
pro-Σ
quotients
of
proﬁnite
fundamental
groups
—
cf.
Deﬁnition
1.1].
The
technical
details
surrounding
this
generalization
occupy
the
bulk
of
§1.
In
§2,
we
observe
that
the
theory
of
§1
may
be
applied,
via
a
similar
argument
to
the
argument
applied
in
[NodNon]
to
derive
[NodNon],
Theorem
B,
from
[NodNon],
Theorem
A,
to
obtain
almost
pro-Σ
generalizations
[cf.
Theorem
2.9;
Corollary
2.10;
Remark
2.10.1]
of
the
injectivity
portion
of
the
theory
of
combinatorial
cuspidalization
[i.e.,
[NodNon],
Theorem
B].
In
the
ﬁnal
portion
of
§2,
we
discuss
the
theory
of
almost
pro-l
commensurators
of
tripods
[i.e.,
copies
of
the
[geometric
fundamental
group
of
the]
projective
line
minus
three
points
—
cf.
Lemma
2.12,
Corollary
2.13],
in
the
context
of
the
theory
of
the
tripod
homomorphism
developed
in
[CbTpII],
§3.
Just

theory
of
§1,
the
theory
of
§2
is
conceptually
not
very
diﬃcult,
but
technically
quite
involved.
Before
proceeding,
we
recall
that
a
substantial
portion
of
the
theory
of
[André]
revolves
around
the
study
of
outomorphism
[i.e.,
outer
automorphism]
groups
of
the
tempered
geometric
fundamental
group
of
a
p-adic
hyperbolic
curve,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
goal
of
establishing
a
p-adic
local
analogue
of
the
well-known
theory
of
the
Grothendieck-Teichmüller
group
[i.e.,
which
appears
in
the
context
of
hyperbolic
curves
over
number
ﬁelds].
From
the
point
of
view
of
the
theory
of
the
present
series
of
papers,
outomorphisms
of
such
tempered
fundamental
groups
may
be
thought
of
as
[i.e.,
are
equivalent
to
—
cf.
Remark
3.3.1;
Proposition
3.6,
(iii);
Remark
3.13.1,
(i)]
outomorphisms
of
the
proﬁnite
geometric
fundamental
group
that
are
“G-admissible”
[cf.
Deﬁnition
3.7,
(i)],
i.e.,
preserve
the
graph-theoretic
structure
on
the
proﬁnite
geometric
fundamental
group.
In
a
word,
the
essential
thrust
of
the
applications
to
the
theory
of
tempered
fundamental
groups
given
in
the
present
paper
may
be
summarized
as
follows:
By
replacing,
in
eﬀect,
the
G-admissible
outomorphism
groups
that
[modulo
the
“translation”
discussed
above]
appear
throughout
the
theory
of
[André]
by
“M-admissible”
outomorphism
groups
—
i.e.,
groups
of
outomorphisms
of
the
proﬁnite
geometric
fundamental
group
that
preserve
not
only
the
graph-theoretic
structure
on
the
proﬁnite
geometric
fundamental
group,
but
also
the
[somewhat
ﬁner]
metric
structure
on
the
various
dual
graphs
that
appear
[i.e.,
the
various
indices
at
the
nodes
of
the
special
ﬁber
of
the
p-adic
curve
under
consideration
—
cf.
Deﬁnition
3.7,
(ii)]
—
it
is
possible
to
overcome
various
signiﬁcant
technical
diﬃculties
that
appear
in
the
theory
of
[André].
Here,
we
recall
that
the
two
main
technical
diﬃculties
that
appear
in
the
theory
of
[André]
may
be
described
as
follows:
•
The
characterization
of
the
local
Galois
groups
in
the
global
Galois
image
associated
to
a
hyperbolic
curve
that
is
given
in
[André],
Theorems
7.2.1,
7.2.3,
is
only
proven
for
a
quite
limited
class
of
hyperbolic
curves
[i.e.,
a
class
that
is
“far
from
generic”
—
cf.
[MzTa],
Corollary
5.7],
which
are
“closely
related
to
tripods”.
•
The
proof
given
in
[André]
of
a
certain
key
injectivity
result,
which
is
of
central
importance
in
establishing

“local

of

group”,
contains
a
fundamental
gap
[cf.
Remark
3.19.1].
In
the
present
paper,
our
approach
to
surmounting
the
ﬁrst
technical
diﬃculty
consists
of
the
following
result
[cf.
Theorems
3.17,
(iv);
3.18,
(i)],
which
asserts,
roughly
speaking,
that
the
theory
of
the
tripod
homomorphism
developed
in
[CbTpII],
§3,
is
compatible
with
the
property
of
M-admissibility.

One
central
technical
aspect
of
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
lies
in
the
equivalence
[cf.
Theorem
3.9]
between
the
M-admissibility
of
outomorphisms
of
the
proﬁnite
geometric
fundamental
group
of
the
given
p-adic
hyperbolic
curve
and
the
I-admissibility
[i.e.,
roughly
speaking,
compatibility
with
the
outer
action,
by
some
open
subgroup
of
the
inertia
group
of
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
the
base
ﬁeld,
on
an
arbitrary
almost
pro-l
quotient
of
the
proﬁnite
geometric
fundamental
group
—
cf.
Deﬁnition
3.8]
of
such
outomorphisms.
This
equivalence
is
obtained
by
applying
the
theory
of
cyclotomic
synchronization
developed
in
[CbTpI],
§5.
Once
this
equivalence
is
established,
the
almost
pro-l
injectivity
results
obtained
in
§2
then
allow
us
to
conclude
that
this
M-admissibility
of
outomorphisms
of
the
proﬁnite
geometric
fundamental
group
of
the
given
p-adic
hyperbolic
curve
is,
in
fact,
equivalent
to
the
I-admissibility
of
any
[necessarily
unique!]
lifting
of
such
an
outomorphism
to
an
outomorphism
of
the
proﬁnite
geometric
fundamental
group
of
a
higher-dimensional
conﬁguration
space
associated
to
the
given
p-adic
hyperbolic
curve
[cf.
Theorem
3.17,
(ii)].
Finally,
by
combining
this
“higher-dimensional
I-admissibility”
with
the
combinatorial
anabelian
theory
of
[CbTpII],
§1,
we
conclude
[cf.
Proposition
3.16,
(i);
Theorem
3.17,
(ii)]
that
a
certain
“higher-dimensional
G-admissibility”
also
holds,
i.e.,
that
the
lifted
outomorphism
of
the
proﬁnite
geometric
fundamental
group
of
a
higher-dimensional
conﬁguration
space
associated
to
the
given
padic
hyperbolic
curve
preserves
the
graph-theoretic
structure
not
only
on
the
proﬁnite
geometric
fundamental
group
of
the
original
hyperbolic
curve,
but
also
on
the
proﬁnite
geometric
fundamental
groups
of
the
various
successive
ﬁbers
of
the
higher-dimensional
conﬁguration
space
under
consideration.
In
a
word,
it
is
precisely
by
applying
this
chain
of
equivalences
—
which
allows
us
to
control
the
graph-theoretic
structure
of
the
successive
ﬁbers
of
the
higher-dimensional
conﬁguration
space
under
consideration
—
that
allow
us
to
surmount
the
two
main
technical
diﬃculties
discussed
above
that
appear
in
the
theory
of
[André].
Put
another
way,
if,
instead
of
considering
M-admissible
outomorphisms
[i.e.,
of
the
proﬁnite
geometric
fundamental
group
of
the
given
COMBINATORIAL

p-adic
hyperbolic
curve],
one
considers
arbitrary
G-admissible
outomorphisms
[of
the
proﬁnite
geometric
fundamental
group
of
the
given
p-adic
hyperbolic
curve,
as
is
done,
in
eﬀect,
in
[André]],
then
there
does
not
appear
to
exist,
at
least
at
the
time
of
writing,
any
eﬀective
way
to
control
the
graph-theoretic
structure
on
the
successive
ﬁbers
of
higher-dimensional
conﬁguration
spaces.
In
this
context,
we
recall
that
in
the
theory
of
[CbTpII],
a
result
is
obtained
concerning
the
preservation
of
the
graph-theoretic
structure
on
the
successive
ﬁbers
of
higher-dimensional
conﬁguration
spaces
[cf.
[CbTpII],
Theorem
4.7],
in
the
context
of
pro-l
geometric
fundamental
groups.
The
signiﬁcance,
however,
of
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
is
that
it
may
be
applied
to
almost
pro-l
geometric
fundamental
groups,
i.e.,
where
the
order
of
the
ﬁnite
quotient
implicit
in
the
term
“almost”
is
allowed
to
be
divisible
by
p.
Once
one
establishes
the
“higher-dimensional
G-admissibility”
discussed
above,
it
is
then
possible
to
apply
the
theory
of
local
contractibility
of
p-adic
analytic
spaces
developed
in
[Brk]
to
construct
from
the
given
outomorphism
of
a
proﬁnite
geometric
fundamental
group
[of
a
higher-dimensional
conﬁguration
space]
an
outomorphism
of
the
corresponding
tempered
fundamental
group
[cf.
Proposition
3.16,
(ii)].
This
portion
of
the
theory
may
be
summarized
as
follows
[cf.
Theorem
3.19,
(ii)].

Up

the

If,

specializes

discussed

to
the
case
of
tripods
[i.e.,

then
one
obtains
the

the

by
considering
the

In
closing,
we
recall
that
“conventional
research”
concerning
the
Grothendieck-Teichmüller
group
GT
tends
to
focus
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
natural
inclusion
of
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
Q
GQ
→
GT
is,
in
fact,
an
isomorphism
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[CbTpII],
Remark
3.19.1].
By
contrast,
one
important
theme
of
the
present
series
of
papers
lies
in
the
point
of
view
that,
instead
of
pursuing
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
GT
is
literally
isomorphic
to
GQ
,
it
is
perhaps
more
natural
to
concentrate
on
the
issue
of
verifying
that
GT
exhibits
analogous
behavior/properties
to
GQ
[or
Q].
From
this
point
of
view,
the
theory
of
tripod
synchronization
and
surjectivity
of
the
tripod
homomorphism
developed
in
[CbTpII]
[cf.
[CbTpII],
Theorem
C,
(iii),
(iv),
as
well
as
the
following
discussion]
may
be
regarded
as
an
abstract
combinatorial
analogue
of
the
scheme-theoretic
fact
that
Spec
Q
lies
under
all
characteristic
zero
schemes/algebraic
stacks
in
a
unique
fashion
—
i.e.,
put
another
way,
that
all
morphisms
between
schemes
and
moduli
stacks
that
occur
in
the
theory
of
hyperbolic
curves
in
characteristic
zero
are
compatible
with
the
respective
structure
morphisms
to
Spec
Q.
In
a
similar
vein,
the
theory
of
the
subgroup
GTM
⊆
GT
developed
in
the
present
paper
may
be
regarded
as
an
abstract
combinatorial
analogue
of
the
various
decomposition
subgroups
Gp
⊆
GF
(⊆
GQ
)
[cf.
Theorem
B]
associated
to
nonarchimedean
primes.
In
particular,
from
the
point
of
view
of
pursuing
“abstract
behavioral
similarities”
to
the
subgroups
Gp
⊆
GF
(⊆
GQ
),
it
is
natural
to
pose
the
question:
Is
the
subgroup
GTM
⊆
GT
commensurably
terminal?
Unfortunately,
in
the
present
paper,
we
are
only
able
to
give
a
partial
answer
to
this
question.
That
is
to
say,
we
show
[cf.
Theorem
3.17,
(v),
and
its
proof;
Remark
3.20.1]
the
following
result.
[Here,
we
remark
that
although
this
result
is
not
stated
explicitly
in
Theorem
3.17,
(v),
it
follows
by
applying
to
GTM
the
argument,
involving
l-graphically
full
actions,
that
was
applied,
in
the
proof
of
Theorem
3.17,
(v),
to
“OutFC

”.]

In

the

Almost
pro-Σ
combinatorial
anabelian
geometry
In
the
present
§1,
we
discuss
almost
pro-Σ
analogues
of
results
on
combinatorial
anabelian
geometry
developed
in
earlier
papers
of
the
authors.
In
particular,
we
obtain
almost
pro-Σ
analogues
of
combinatorial
versions
of
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
for
outer
representations
of
NN-
and
IPSC-type
[cf.
Theorem
1.11;
Corollary
1.12
below].
These
almost
pro-Σ
analogues
of
combinatorial
versions
of
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
will
be
applied
in
§2,
together
with
various
standard
techniques
of
combinatorial
anabelian
geometry,
to
obtain
almost
pro-Σ
analogues
of
certain
standard
injectivity
results
that
will
be
applied
in
§3
to
derive
fundamental
results
concerning
the
outer
representations
of
Galois
groups
that
arise
from
hyperbolic
curves
and
their
associated
conﬁguration
spaces
over
p-adic
ﬁelds.
In
the
present
§1,
let
Σ
⊆
Σ†
be
nonempty
sets
of
prime
numbers
and
G
a
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
of
pro-Σ†
PSC-type.
Write
G
for
the
underlying
semi-graph
of
G,
ΠG
for
the
[pro-Σ†
]
fundamental
group
of
G,
and
G
→
G
for
the
universal
covering
of
G
corresponding
to
ΠG
.
Deﬁnition
1.1.
Let
G
be
a
proﬁnite
group,
N
⊆
G
a
normal
open
subgroup
of
G,
and
G

Q
a
quotient
of
G.
Then
we
shall
say
that
Q
is
the
maximal
almost
pro-Σ
quotient
of
G
with
respect
to
N
if
the
kernel
of
the

[cf.
the
discussion
entitled
“Topological
groups”
in
§0],
i.e.,
Q
=
G/Ker(N

N
Σ
).
Thus,
Q
ﬁts
into
an
exact
sequence
of
proﬁnite
groups
1
−→
N
Σ
−→
Q
−→
G/N
−→

.
[Note
that
since
N
is
normal
in
G,
and
the
kernel
Ker(N

)
of
the
natural
surjection
N

N
Σ
is
characteristic
in
N
,
it
holds
that
Ker(N

N
Σ
)
is
normal
in
G.]
We
shall
say
that
Q
is
a
maximal
almost
pro-Σ
quotient
of
G
if
Q
is
the
maximal
almost
pro-Σ
quotient
of

with
respect
to
some

open

Write
NJ
⊆

for
the

of

[Thus,
NJ
is
a
normal

subgroup
of
J.]
Then
the
quotient
of
J
determined
by
the

i.e.,
the

is
the
maximal

then
the

H
⊆
G
be
a
normal
closed
subgroup
of
G
and
H

H
∗
a
maximal
almost
pro-Σ
quotient
of
H.
Suppose
that
H
is
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated.
Then
there
exists
a
maximal
almost
pro-Σ
quotient
H

H
∗∗
of
H
which
dominates
H

H
∗
[cf.
the
discussion
entitled
“Topological
groups”
in
§0]
such
that
the
kernel
of
H

H
∗∗
is
normal
in
G.
Proof.
Assertions
(i),
(ii)
follow
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved.
Next,
we
verify
assertion
(iii).
Let
N
⊆
H
be
a
normal
open
subgroup
of
H
with
respect
to
which
H
∗
is
the
maximal
almost
pro-Σ
quotient
of
H.
Now
since
H
is
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated,
and
N
⊆
H
is
open,
it
follows
that
there
exists
a
characteristic
open
subgroup
J
⊆
H
such
that
J
⊆
N
.
Observe
that
since
H
is
normal
in
G,
and
J
is
characteristic
in
H,
it
holds
that
J
is
normal
in
G.
Thus,
if
we
write
H
∗∗
for
the
maximal
almost
pro-Σ
quotient
of
H
with
respect
to
J,
then
H
∗∗
satisﬁes
the
conditions
of
assertion
(iii).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii).

pose
that

Proof.
Necessity
in
the

of

from
[NodNon],

To
verify
sufﬁciency,
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that

immediately
from

that

that

that

Then
suﬃciency
in
the
case
of
outer
representations
of
VA-type
(respectively,
NN-type;

follows
immediately,
in
light
of
the
criterion
of
[CbTpI],
Corollary
5.9,

from

Proof.
Let
N
⊆
ΠG
be
a
normal
open
subgroup
of
ΠG
with
respect
to
which
Π∗G
is
the
maximal
almost
pro-Σ
quotient
of

.
[Thus,
N
Σ
⊆
Π∗G
.]
Write
GN
→
G
for
the
connected
ﬁnite
étale
Galois
subcovering
of
G
→
G
corresponding
to
N
⊆
ΠG
.
Thus,
N
Σ
⊆
Π∗G
may
be
regarded
as
the
[pro-Σ]
fundamental
group
of
the
pro-Σ
completion
Σ
GN
[cf.
[SemiAn],
Deﬁnition
2.9,
(ii)]
of
GN
,
i.e.,
N
Σ
=
ΠGNΣ
.
First,
we
verify
assertion
(i).
Since
ΠG
is
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated,
it
is
immediate
that
Π∗G
is
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated.
Now
let
us
recall
[cf.
[MzTa],
Remark
1.2.2;
[MzTa],
Proposition
1.4]
that
N
Σ
=
ΠGNΣ
is
torsion-free
and
slim.
Thus,
the
fact
that
Π∗G
is
almost
torsion-free
is
immediate;
the
slimness
of
Π∗G
follows
immediately,
by
considering
the
natural
outer
action
ΠG
/N
→
Out(N
Σ
),
from
the
wellknown
fact
that
any
nontrivial
automorphism
of
a
stable
log
curve
over
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
of
characteristic
∈
Σ
induces
a
nontrivial
outomorphism
of
the
maximal
pro-Σ
quotient
of
the
geometric
log
fundamental
group
of
the
stable
curve
[cf.
[CmbGC],
Proposition
1.2,
(i),
(ii);
[MzTa],
Proposition
1.4,
applied
to
the
verticial
subgroups
of
the
geometric
log
fundamental
group
under
consideration].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Next,
we
verify
assertion
(ii).
Let
us
recall
that
since
Πz
∩
N
⊆
N
=
ΠGN
is
a
VCN-subgroup
of
ΠGN
,
the
natural
homomorphism
(Πz
∩
N
)Σ
→
ΠΣ
GN
is
injective
[cf.,
e.g.,
the
proof
of
[SemiAn],
Proposition
2.5,
(i);
[SemiAn],
Example
2.10].
Thus,
it
follows
immediately
from
Lemma
1.2,
(ii),
that
Π∗z
is
a
maximal
almost
pro-Σ
quotient
of
Πz
.
In
particular,
if
z
∈
Vert(G),
then
it
follows
immediately
from
assertion
(i)
that
Π∗z
is
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated
and
slim.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).

Next,
we
verify
assertions
(iii),
(v),
and
(vi).
Since
N
Σ
=
ΠGNΣ
,
one
veriﬁes
easily
—
by
considering
the
intersections
of
N
Σ
=
ΠGNΣ
with
the
various
VCN-subgroups
of
Π∗G
under
consideration
and
applying
[NodNon],
Lemma
1.9,
(ii)
(respectively,
[NodNon],
Lemma
1.5;
[NodNon],
Lemma
1.7),
together
with
the
well-known
fact
that
every
VCN-subgroup
of
ΠGNΣ
is
nontrivial
and
torsion-free
[hence
also
inﬁnite]
—
that
assertion
(iii)
(respectively,
(v);
(vi))
holds.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertions
(iii),
(v),
and
(vi).
Assertion
(vii)
follows
formally
from
assertions
(iii),
(v).
Indeed,
let
Π∗z
⊆
Π∗G
be
the
VCN-subgroup

and
γ
∈
CΠ∗
(Π∗
).
Then
of
Π∗G
associated
to
an
element
z
∈
VCN(G)
z
G
it
follows
immediately
from
assertions
(iii),
(v)
that
z
=
zγ
;
we
thus
conclude
that
γ
∈
Π∗z.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(vii).
Next,
we
verify
assertion
(iv).
By
applying
[NodNon],
Lemma
1.8,
Σ
to
GN
,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
(EG
∗
(
v1
(G
∗
))
∩
EG
∗
(
v2
(G
∗
)))
=
1.
Thus,
it
follows
immediately
from
assertion
(vi);
[NodNon],
Lemma
1.5;
[NodNon],
Lemma
1.9,
(ii),
that
Π∗e
∩N
Σ
=
Π∗v1
∩Π∗v2
∩N
Σ
.
Since
N
Σ
is
open
in
Π∗G
,
we
conclude
from
assertion
(vi)
that
Π∗e
is
an
open
subgroup
of
Π∗v1
∩
Π∗v2
,
hence
that
Π∗v1
∩
Π∗v2
⊆
CΠ∗G
(Π∗e)
=
Π∗e
[cf.
assertion
(vii)].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iv).
Finally,
we
verify
assertion
(viii).
It
follows
from
the
deﬁnition
of
an
almost
pro-Σ
quotient
that
the
natural
surjection
Πz

Π‡z
factors
through
a
maximal
almost
pro-Σ
quotient
of
Πz
.
Thus,
by
replacing
Π‡z
by
a
suitable
maximal
almost
pro-Σ
quotient
of
Πz
,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
Π‡z
is
a
maximal
almost
pro-Σ
quotient
of
Πz
.
Let
Nz
⊆
Πz
be
a
normal
open
subgroup
of
Πz
with
respect
to
which
Π‡z
is
the
maximal
almost
pro-Σ
quotient
of
Πz
and
NG
⊆
ΠG
a
normal
open
subgroup
of
ΠG
such
that
NG
∩
Πz
⊆
Nz
.
Here,
we
recall
that
the
existence
of
such
a
subgroup
NG
follows
immediately
from
the
fact
that
the
natural
proﬁnite
topology
on
Πz
coincides
with
the
topology
on
Πz
induced
by
the
topology
of
ΠG
.
Then
one
veriﬁes
easily
that
the
maximal
almost
pro-Σ
quotient
of
ΠG
with
respect
to
NG
⊆
ΠG
is
a
maximal
almost
pro-Σ
quotient
of
ΠG
as
in
the
statement
of
assertion
(viii).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(viii).

[cf.
i
i
Deﬁnition
1.6,
(v)].
Then
α
is
the
identity
outomorphism.
Proof.
First,
let
us
observe
that
it
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
a
proﬁnite
Dehn
multi-twist
that
α
is
a
proﬁnite
Dehn
multitwist
of
Π∗G
.
Let
us
ﬁx
a
verticial
subgroup
Πv2
⊆
ΠG
associated
to
v2
.
Let
Πe1
,
Πe2
⊆
ΠG
be
nodal
subgroups
associated
to
e1
,
e2
,
respectively,
which
are
contained
in
Πv2
;
Πv1
⊆
ΠG
a
verticial
subgroup
associated
to
v1
which
contains
Πe1
;
Πv3
⊆
ΠG
a
verticial
subgroup
associated
to
v3
which
contains
Πe2
.
Thus,
we
have
inclusions
Πv1
⊇
Πe1
⊆
Πv2
⊇
Πe2
⊆
Πv3
.
For
each
z
∈
{v1
,
v2
,
v3
,
e1
,
e2
},
write
Π∗z
⊆
Π∗G
for
the
VCN-subgroup
of
Π∗G
associated
to
z
obtained
by
forming
the
image
of
Πz
⊆
ΠG
in
Π∗G
.
Then
since
α
is
a
proﬁnite
Dehn
multi-twist,
there
exists
a
lifting
α[v2
]
∈
Aut(Π∗G
)
of
α
which
preserves
and
induces
the
identity
automorphism
of
Π∗v2
;
in
particular,
α[v2
]
preserves
and
induces
the
identity
automorphisms
of
Π∗e1
,
Π∗e2
.
Moreover,
by
applying
a
similar
argument
to
the
argument
given
in
the
proof
of

On

it
follows
immediately
from
a
similar
argument
to
the
argument
applied
in

of
[CmbCsp],

that

topologically

in

Π∗G

topologically

Thus,
we

Suppose,
moreover,
that
ρI
,
ρJ
are
of
NN-type
[cf.
Deﬁnition

Then
the
following
three
conditions
are
equivalent:
(1)
The
isomorphism
α
is
group-theoretically
verticial
[i.e.,
roughly
speaking,
preserves

—
cf.

that

that

Then
α
is
group-theoretically

hence
also
group-theoretically

Proof.
The
implication
(1)
⇒
(2)
of
assertion
(i)
and
the
ﬁnal
portion
of
assertion
(ii)
[i.e.,
the
portion

follow
immediately
from
Proposition
1.7,
(iv).
The
implication
(2)
⇒
(3)
of

(i)
is
immediate.
Finally,
we
verify
assertion
(ii)
(respectively,
the
implication
(3)
⇒
(1)
of
assertion
(i)).
Suppose
that
ρI
,
ρJ

in

Let
NG

respect
to
which
Π∗G

Π∗H

the
maximal

of
ΠG
,
ΠH
,
respectively.
[Thus,
NGΣ
⊆
Π∗G
,
NHΣ
⊆

.]
Now
it
follows
immediately
from
the
fact
that
Π∗G
,
Π∗H
are
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated
[cf.
Proposition

that
there

that

Thus,
it
follows

of

(respectively,
the

Almost

In
the

§2,
we
develop
an
almost
pro-Σ
version
of
the
injectivity
portion
of
the
theory
of
combinatorial
cuspidalization
[cf.

The
signiﬁcance
of
developing
these
almost
pro-l
analogues
of
standard
results
in

is
that
they
allow

to

techniques
that
are,
a

only
available
in
the
pro-l
case
to
proﬁnite
fundamental
groups.
Such
pro-l
techniques
will
be
necessary
to
verify
the
results
obtained
in

concerning
various
metric
aspects
of
the
outer
representations
of

arise
from

Proof.
First,
we
verify
assertion
(i).
Observe
that
it
follows
immediately
from
Proposition
1.7,
(i),
together
with
the
deﬁnition
of
an
SA-maximal
almost
pro-l
quotient,
that
Π∗n
is
a
successive
extension
of
almost
pro-l,
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated,
slim
proﬁnite
groups.
Thus,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
Π∗n
is
almost
pro-l,
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated,
and
slim.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Next,
we
verify
assertion
(ii).
First,
observe
that
since
(Πn/m1
/Πn/m2
)‡
may
be
regarded
as
an
almost
pro-l
quotient
of
Πn/m1
,
we
may
assume
def
without
loss
of
generality
that
m2
=
n.
Write
m
=
m1
.
If
m
=
n,
then
one
may
take
the
quotient
Π∗∗
n
to
be
the
maximal
pro-l
quotient
of
Πn
[cf.
[MzTa],
Proposition
2.2,
(i)].
Thus,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
m
≤
n
−
1.
Let
us
verify
assertion
(ii)
by
induction
on
n.
If
n
=
1,
then
assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
the
fact
that
Π1
is
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated,
which
implies
that
the
topology
of
Π1
admits
a
basis
of
characteristic
open
subgroups.
Thus,
we
suppose
that
n
≥
2,
and
that
the
induction
hypothesis
is
in
force.
Then
observe
that
since
the
subgroup
Πn/n−1
⊆
Πn
may
be
regarded
as
the
“Π1
”
associated
to
some
stable
log
curve
of
type
(g,
r
+
n
−
1),
by
applying
the
induction
hypothesis
to
the
quotient
Πn/n−1

Π‡n/n−1
determined
by
the
quotient
Πn/m

Π‡n/m
,
we
obtain
an
F-characteristic

quotient
Π∗∗
n/n−1
of
Πn/n−1
which
dominates
Πn/n−1

Πn/n−1
.
In
particular,
since
the
quotient
Πn/n−1

Π∗∗
n/n−1
is
F-characteristic,
hence
arises
from
a
subgroup
of
Πn/n−1
which
is
normal
in
Πn
,
we
thus
obtain
a
natural
outer
action
∼
Πn
/Πn/n−1
(→
Πn−1
)
→
Out(Π∗∗
n/n−1
)
.
Since
the
proﬁnite
group
Π∗∗
n/n−1
is
almost
pro-l
and
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated
[cf.
assertion
(i)],
it
follows
immediately
that
the
outer
action
Πn
/Πn/n−1
→
Out(Π∗∗
n/n−1
)
factors
through
an
almost
pro-l
quotient
Πn
/Πn/n−1

Q
of
Πn
/Πn/n−1
.
In
particular,
it
follows
that
the
natural
outer
action
Πn/m
/Πn/n−1
⊆
Πn
/Πn/n−1
→
Out(Π∗∗
n/n−1
)
factors
through
an
almost
pro-l
quotient
of
Πn/m
/Πn/n−1
.
Note
that
this
implies
[cf.
the
slimness
of
Π∗∗
n/n−1
proved
in
assertion
(i)]
that
there
exists
an
almost
pro-l
quotient
Πn/m

Q∗∗
of
Πn/m
that
induces
the
quotient
Πn/n−1

Π∗∗
n/n−1
of
Πn/n−1
.
Now
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
the
∗∗∗
quotient
Q
determined
by
the
intersection
of
the
kernels
of
the
two
quotients
Πn/m

Π‡n/m
,
Πn/m

Q∗∗
is
an
almost
pro-l
quotient
of
Πn/m
that
induces
the
quotient
Πn/n−1

Π∗∗
n/n−1
of
Πn/n−1
.
Thus,
we
conclude
that
by
replacing
the
quotient
Πn/m

Π‡n/m
by
this
quotient
Q∗∗∗
,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
the
quotient
Πn/m

Π‡n/m
induces
the
quotient
Πn/n−1

Π∗∗
n/n−1
of
Πn/n−1
.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
if
we
regard
Πn
/Πn/n−1
as
the
“Πn−1
”
associated
to
some
stable
log
curve
of
type
(g,
r),
then:
•
If
we
apply
the
induction
hypothesis
to
the
almost
pro-l
quotient
Πn/m
/Πn/n−1

Π‡n/m
/Π‡n/n−1
,
then
we
obtain
an
[Fcharacteristic
SA-maximal]
almost
pro-l
quotient
Πn
/Πn/n−1

Q‡
of
Πn
/Πn/n−1
which
induces
a
quotient
of
Πn/m
/Πn/n−1
that
dominates
the
quotient
Πn/m
/Πn/n−1

Π‡n/m
/Π‡n/n−1
.
•
If
we
apply
the
induction
hypothesis
to
any
almost
pro-l
quotient
of
Πn
/Πn/n−1
that
dominates
both
Q
and
Q‡
[e.g.,
the
quotient
determined
by
the
intersection
of
the
kernels
determined
by
the
quotients

],
then
we
obtain
an
F-characteristic

moreover,
induces
a

In
particular,
the

The

the

we

in

since

This
completes
the
proof

Finally,
we
claim
that
the
following
assertion
holds:
Claim
2.8.C:
Lemma
2.8
holds
for
arbitrary
(g,
r).
We
verify
Claim
2.8.C
by
induction
on
3g
−
3
+
r.
If
3g
−
3
+
r
=
0,
i.e.,
(g,
r)
=
(0,
3),
then
Claim
2.8.C
amounts
to
Claim
2.8.A.
On
the
other
hand,
if
(g,
r)
=
(1,
1),
then
Claim
2.8.C
amounts
to
Claim
2.8.B.
Thus,
we
suppose
that
3g
−
3
+
r
>
0,
that
(g,
r)
=
(1,
1),
and
that
the
induction

is
in

Since
3g

3

r
>
0
and
(g,
r)
=
(1,

one
veriﬁes
easily
that
there

Then

Proof.
First,
we
claim
that
the
following
assertion
holds:
Claim
2.9.A:
To
verify
Theorem
2.9,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
Theorem
2.9
in
the
case
where
the
kernel
of
the
natural

Π∗n+1
is
contained
in

,
i.e.,
the

∼


Π∗n+1
/Π∗n+1/n
—
where
the
ﬁrst
arrow
is
the
natural

—
is
an
isomorphism.
Indeed,
Claim
2.9.A
follows
immediately,
by
considering
the
objects
obtained
by
base-changing
the
various
objects
that
appear
in
the
case
∼
of
an
arbitrary
quotient

Π∗n+1
via
the
natural
surjection
Πn
←
Πn+1
/Πn+1/n

Π∗n+1
/Π∗n+1/n
.
By
Claim
2.9.A,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
the
kernel
of
Πn+1

Π∗n+1
is
contained
in
Πn+1/n
.
Next,
we
claim
that
the
following
assertion
holds:
Claim
2.9.B:
To
verify
Theorem
2.9,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
Theorem
2.9
in
the
case
where
n
=
1.
Indeed,
suppose
that
n
≥
2,
and
that
Theorem
2.9
holds
whenever
n
=
1.
Write
Πn+1/n−1
⊆
Πn+1
for
the
kernel
of
the
outer
surjection
Πn+1

Πn−1
induced
by
the
projection
Xn+1

for
∗
the
quotient
of
Πn+1/n−1
determined
by
the
quotient
Πn+1

Πn+1
.
Then
let
us
recall
[cf.
[MzTa],
Proposition
2.4,
(i)]
that
one
may
interpret
the
surjection
Π∗n+1/n−1

Πn/n−1
induced
by
the
ﬁxed
surjection
prΠ
:
Πn+1



Π1
”
in
the
case
where
“X”
is
of
type
(g,

+
n
−

Thus,
by
applying
Theorem
2.9

in
the
case
where
n
=
1
to
the
quotient
Πn+1/n−1

Π∗n+1/n−1
,
we
obtain
a
quotient
Π∗∗

of
Πn+1/n−1
which
satisﬁes
conditions
(i),
(ii),
(iii)
in
the

of
Theorem
2.9.
[Here,
we
note
that
since
the
kernel
of
Πn+1/n−1

Π∗n+1/n−1
is
contained
in
Πn+1/n
,
the
kernel
of
Πn+1/n−1

Π∗∗
n+1/n−1
is
also
contained
in
Πn+1/n
.]
Next,
let
N
⊆
Πn+1/n
be
a
normal
open
subgroup
of
Πn+1/n
with
respect
to
which
Π∗∗
n+1/n
is
a
maximal
almost
pro-Σ
quotient
of
Πn+1/n
.
Then
it
follows
immediately
from
Lemma
1.2,
(iii)
[cf.
also
[MzTa],
Proposition
2.2,
(ii)],
that
we
may
assume
without
loss
of

—
by
replacing
N

N
—
∗∗
that
the
kernel
of
Πn+1/n

Π∗∗
n+1/n
is

Write
Πn+1
for
the
quotient
of
Πn+1
by
the
kernel
of
Πn+1/n

Π∗∗
n+1/n
.
Then
it
is
im∗∗
mediate
that
this
quotient
Πn+1
satisﬁes
conditions
(i),
(ii)
in
the
statement
of
Theorem
2.9,
and,
moreover,
that
the
kernel
of
Πn+1

Π∗∗
n+1
is
satisﬁes
condition
(iii)
in
the

To

that

statement
of
Theorem

let
Πn+1

Πn+1
be
a

statement
of
Theorem
2.9
and
α
∗
an

of
Π∗∗∗
Π∗n+1
which
arises
from
an
FC-admissible
automorphism
α
n+1
∗∗∗
over

Then
since
α

FC-admissible,
it
is
immediate
that
α

preserves
Π∗∗∗

where
we

for
the

of

determined
by


Π∗∗∗

In
particular,
it
,
together
with
the
fact
that
α
∗∗∗
is
follows
from
our
choice
of
Π∗∗

that
we
may
assume
without

of

—
i.e.,
by
replacing
α
∗
by
a
suitable
Π∗n+1/n−1
-conjugate,
which
may
in
fact

light
of
the
slimness
of

e.g.,

be
taken
to
be
a
Π∗n+1/n

—
that
the
automorphism
of

is
the

Thus,
since
α
∗
is
an
Π∗n+1/n
induced
by

automorphism
of
Π∗n+1
over
Πn
,
and
Π∗n+1/n
is
slim
[cf.
Proposition

we
may

that

In
particular,
we
conclude
that

This

From

natural
to
pose
the

question:
Is
it
possible

the

Proof.
First,
we
verify
assertion
(i).
Observe
that
we
have
inclusions
Π∗cdiag
⊆
Dc∗diag
⊆
CΠ∗2
(Π∗cdiag
).
Thus,
since
Πc∗diag
is
commensurably
terminal
in
Π∗2/1
[cf.
Proposition
1.7,
(vii)],
we
conclude
that
Π∗cdiag
⊆
Dc∗diag
∩
Π∗2/1
⊆
CΠ∗2
(Π∗cdiag
)
∩
Π∗2/1
=
CΠ∗2/1
(Π∗cdiag
)
=
Π∗cdiag
.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Assertions
(ii),
(iii)
follow
immediately
from
assertion
(i),
together
with
the
[easily
veriﬁed]
fact
that
the
com)∗
(pΠ
2/1
posite
Dc∗diag
→
Π∗2

Π∗1
is
surjective.
Next,
we
verify
assertion
(iv).
Since
Π∗vnew
is
slim
and
commensurably
terminal
in
Π∗2/1
[cf.
Proposition
1.7,
(ii),
(vii)],
it
follows
that
Iv∗new
|zx
∩
Π∗2/1
=
{1},
which
implies
the
injectivity
of
the
composite
in
question.
On
the
other
hand,
since
the
composite
Ivnew
|zx
→
Dvnew
|zx
→
Π2
|zx

Πzx
is
surjective
[cf.

it
follows
immediately
that
the
composite
Iv∗new
|zx
→
Dv∗new
|zx
→
Π∗2
|zx

Π∗zx
is
surjective.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iv).
Next,
we
verify
assertion
(v).
It
follows
immediately
from
assertion
(iv),
together
with
the
commensurable
terminality
of
Π∗vnew
in
Π∗2/1
[cf.
Proposition
1.7,

that
we
have
a

—
where
we
observe
that
the
inclusion
Iv∗new
|zx
→
Dv∗new
|zx
determines
a
splitting
of
this
exact
sequence.
Thus,
it
follows
from
the
deﬁnition

that
the

mine
an

On

other
hand,
again
by
the
commensurable
terminality
of
Π∗vnew
in
Π∗2/1
[cf.
Proposition
1.7,
(vii)],
the
above
displayed
sequence
implies
that
Dv∗new
|zx
=
CΠ∗2
|zx
(Π∗vnew
).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(v).
Next,
we
verify
assertion
(vi).
It
follows
from
the
commensurable
terminality
of
Π∗vnew
in
Π∗2/1
[cf.
Proposition
1.7,
(vii)]
that
Dv∗new
|zx
∩
Π∗2/1
=
Π∗vnew
.
Thus,
since
Π∗2/1
is
normal
in
Π∗2
,
assertion
(vi)
follows
immediately
from
[CbTpII],
Lemma
3.9,
(i).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(vi).
Finally,
we
verify
assertion
(vii).
Since
Π∗zx
⊆
Π∗1
is
commensurably
terminal
in
Π∗1
[cf.
Proposition
1.7,
(vii)],
it
follows
from
the
surjectivity
of
the
composite
Dv∗new
|zx
→
Π∗2
|zx

Π∗zx
[cf.
assertion
(iv)]
that
CΠ∗2
(Dv∗new
|zx
)
⊆
Π∗2
|zx
.
In
particular,
it
follows
immediately
from
assertions
(v),
(vi)
that
Dv∗new
|zx
⊆
CΠ∗2
(Dv∗new

CΠ∗2
(Π∗vnew

Π∗2

Finally,
we

it

This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion

Finally,
before
proceeding,
we
review
the
following
well-known
result.
Lemma

(Automorphisms
of
stable
log
curves).
Let
l
be
a
def
def
prime
number.
Write
laut
=
l
if
l
is
odd;
laut
=
4
if
l
is
even.
If
G
is
a
proﬁnite
group,
then
we
shall
refer
to
the
tensor
product
with
Z/laut
Z
of
the
abelianization
of
G
as
the
laut
-abelianization
of
G.
Let
(g,
r)
be
a
pair
of
nonnegative
integers
such
that
2g
−
2
+
r
>
0.
(i)
Let
k
be
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
such
that
l
is
invertible
in
k,
(Spec
k)log
the
log
scheme
obtained
by
equipping
Spec
k
with
the
log
structure
determined
by
the
fs
chart
N

that
maps
1
→
0,
X
log
a
stable
log
curve
over
(Spec

and
α
an
automorphism
of

Write



((Spec

Suppose
that
α
acts
trivially
on
the
laut
-abelianization
of
Π1
.
Then
α
is
the
identity
automorphism.
(ii)
Write
Mlog
for
the
moduli
stack
of
pointed
stable
curves
of
type
(g,
r)
over
Z[1/l],
where
we
regard
the
marked
points
as
unordered,
equipped
with
the
log
structure
determined
by
the
divisor
at
inﬁnity,
and
C
log
→
Mlog
for
the
tautological
stable

curve
over
Mlog
.
Write
N
log
→
Mlog
for
the
ﬁnite
log
étale
morphism
of

regular
log
stacks
determined
by
the
local
system
of
trivializations
of
the
laut
-abelianizations
of
the
log
fundamental
groups
of
the
various
logarithmic
ﬁbers
of
C
log
→
Mlog
.
Then
the
underlying
algebraic
stack
N
of
N
log
is
an
algebraic
space.
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
We
begin
by
recalling
that
when
X
log
is
a
smooth
log
curve,
and
r
≤
1
[so
g
≥
1],
assertion
(i)
follows
immediately
from
classical
theory
of
endomorphisms
of
semi-abelian
varieties
and
automorphisms
of
stable
curves
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Des],
Lemme
5.17;
[DM],
Theorems
1.11,
1.13],
together
with
[in
the
case
where
l
=
2]
the
well-known
fact
that
every
root
of
unity
ζ
such
that
(ζ
−
1)/laut
is
an
algebraic
integer
is
necessarily
equal
to
1.
Now
let
us
return
to
the
case
of
an
arbitrary
stable
log
curve
X
log
.
Then
it
follows
immediately
from
the
description
of
the
relationship
between
the
abelianization
of
Π1
and
the
abelianizations
of
verticial
subgroups
of
Π1
given
in
[NodNon],
Lemma
1.4,
together
with
the
portion
of
assertion
(i)
that
has
already
been
veriﬁed,
that
α
stabilizes
and
induces
the
identity
automorphism
on
each
of
the
irreducible
components
of
X
log
of
genus
≥
1.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
it
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
laut
,
together
with
the
well-known
structure
of
the
submodule
of
the
abelianization
of
Π1
generated
by
the
cuspidal
inertia
subgroups,
that
α
acts
trivially
on
the
set
of
cusps
of
X
log
.
Thus,
by
considering
the
various
connected
components
of
the
union
of
the
genus
zero
irreducible
components
of
X
log
,
we
conclude
that,
to
complete
the
veriﬁcation
of
assertion
(i),
it
suﬃces
to
verify,
in
the
case
where
g
=
0,
that
any
automorphism
of
X
log
over
(Spec
k)log
that
acts
trivially
on
the
set
of
cusps
of
X
log
is
equal
to
the
identity
automorphism.
But
this
follows
immediately
by
induction
on
r,
i.e.,
by
considering,
when
r
≥
4,
the
stable
log
curve
obtained
from
X
log
by
“forgetting”,
successively,
each
of
the
cusps
of
X
log
.
[Here,
we
apply
the
elementary
combinatorial
fact
that
every
non-smooth
pointed
stable
curve
of
genus
0
has
at
least
two
irreducible
components
that
contain
cusps.]
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
assertion
(i),
together
with
well-known
generalities
concerning
algebraic
stacks
[cf.,
e.g.,
the
discussion
surrounding

Applications

In

we
apply
the

together
with
the

of
[CbTpI],
§5,
to
obtain
applications
to
the

In

we
prove
a
generalization
of
a

due
to
André

concerning

[cf.

Write

for

If

then
we
suppose
further
that

either
equal
to

or
of

Let

We

for

Thus,

On

In

veriﬁes

Let

Then:

imply

Proof.
First,
we
claim
that

Claim

Suppose
that

that

suppose

that
◦
p
=
•

=
•
Σ,
and,
moreover,
that
(c∃
)
is
satisﬁed.
This
completes
the
proof
of
Claim
3.6.A.
Next,
we
verify
assertion
(i).
Let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
it
follows
from
the
fact
that
graphicity
implies
group-theoretic
verticiality
that
the
following
implications
hold:
(c∀
)
⇒
(b∀
)
and
(c∃
)
⇒
(b∃
).
Next,
we
verify
the
implication
(b∃
)
⇒
(b∀
)
(respectively,
(c∃
)
⇒
(c∀
)).
Suppose
that
(b∃
)
(respectively,
(c∃
))
is
satisﬁed.
Then
it
follows
that
◦
Σ
=
•
Σ
⊆
{◦
p,
•
p}.
Next,
let
us
observe
that,
to
complete
the
veriﬁcation
of
(b∀
)
(respectively,
(c∀
)),
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
—
by
replacing
the
open
subgroup
◦
H
⊆
◦
Π1
in
(b∀
)
(respectively,
(c∀
))
by
◦
Π1
—
that
◦
H
=
◦
Π1
and
•
H
=
•
Π1
.
Moreover,
one
veriﬁes
easily
that,
to
complete
the
veriﬁcation
of
(b∀
)
(respectively,
(c∀
)),
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
—
by
replacing
the
subset
Σ
in
(b∀
)
(respectively,
(c∀
))
by
◦
Σ\(◦
Σ∩{◦
p,
•
p})
=
•
Σ\(•
Σ∩{◦
p,
•
p})
(=
∅)
—
that
Σ
=
◦
Σ
\
(◦
Σ
∩
{◦
p,
•
p})
=
•
Σ
\
(•
Σ
∩
{◦
p,
•
p})
(=
∅).
Let
◦
U
⊆
◦
Π1
def
be
a
characteristic
open
subgroup.
Write
•
U
=
α(◦
U
)
⊆
•
Π1
.
Then
it
follows
immediately
from
(b∃
)
(respectively,
(c∃
))
that
there
exists
a
nonempty
subset
Σ◦
U
⊆
Σ
such
that
α
induces
a
functorial
bijection
∼
Vert(G◦
U
[Σ])
=
Vert(G◦
U
[Σ◦
U
])
−→
Vert(G•
U
[Σ◦
U
])
=
Vert(G•
U
[Σ])
(respectively,
∼
VCN(G◦
U
[Σ])
=
VCN(G◦
U
[Σ◦
U
])
−→
VCN(G•
U
[Σ◦
U
])
=
VCN(G•
U
[Σ])).
In
particular,
by
considering
these
functorial
bijections
between
the
sets
“Vert”
(respectively,
“VCN”)
associated
to
the
connected
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
corresponding
to
the
various
characteristic
open
subdef
groups
◦
U
⊆
◦
Π1
,
•
U
=
α(◦
U
)
⊆
•
Π1
,
we
conclude
that
the
isomor∼
•
Σ
phism
◦
ΠΣ
1
→
Π1
is
group-theoretically
verticial
(respectively,
grouptheoretically
verticial
and
group-theoretically
edge-like,
hence
graphic
[cf.
[CmbGC],
Proposition
1.5,
(ii)]).
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
implication
(b∃
)
⇒
(b∀
)
(respectively,
(c∃
)
⇒
(c∀
)).
Next,
we
observe
that
since
(a)
implies
that
◦
Σ
=
•
Σ
⊆
{◦
p,
•
p},
the
implication
(a)
⇒
(b∃
)
follows
from
[SemiAn],
Theorem
3.7,
(iv),
together
with
[the
evident
Σ-tempered
analogue
of]
the
discussion
of
[SemiAn],
Example
2.10.
Thus,
to
complete
the
veriﬁcation
of
assertion
(i),
it
suﬃces
to
verify
the
implication
(b∃
)
⇒
(a).
To
this
end,
suppose
that
(b∃
)
is
satisﬁed.
Let
◦
H
⊆
◦
Π1
be
a
characteristic
open
subgroup
of
◦
Π1
.
Then
it
follows
from
(b∃
)
that
there
exists
a
nonempty
subset
def
Σ
⊆

=
•

such
that
◦
p,

and,
moreover,
if

Proposition

the

Thus,
it
follows
immediately
from

Moreover,
it
follows
immediately
from

that

First,

ﬁx

l
and
consider
the
condition:
(b{l}
):
α
is
{l}-I-admissible

Then
[since
l
is
arbitrary,
and
condition
(a)
is
manifestly
independent
of
the
choice
of
l]
it
follows
formally
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved
that
to
verify
Theorem

it
suﬃces
to
verify
the
equivalence
(a)
⇐⇒
(b{l}

.

we

Proof.
First,
we
verify
assertion
(i)
by
induction
on
n.
Write
◦
J
n−1
for
the
image
of
◦
J
in
◦
Πn−1
and
(◦
J
n/n−1
){l}
for
the
maximal
pro-l
def
quotient
of
the
kernel
◦
J
n/n−1
=
Ker(◦
J

◦
J
n−1
).
Now
let
us
observe
that
if
n
=
1,
then
assertion
(i)
follows
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved
[cf.
also
the
fact
that
◦
Πn
is
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated
—
cf.
[MzTa],
Proposition
2.2,
(ii)]].
Thus,
suppose
that
n
≥
2,
and
that
the
induction
hypothesis
is
in
force.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
since
◦
Πn
is
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated
[cf.
[MzTa],
Proposition
2.2,
(ii)],
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
—
by
replacing
◦
J
by
a
suitable
open
subgroup
of
◦
J
—
that
◦
J
satisﬁes
condition
(a)
of
Deﬁnition
3.10
in
the
case
where
we
take
“i”
to
be
n.
Next,
by
applying
the
induction
hypothesis
to
◦
J
n−1
,
we
obtain
an
open
subgroup
◦
H
n−1
⊆
◦
Πn−1
of
◦
Πn−1
that
is
contained
in
def
◦
J
n−1
and
of
l-polystable
type.
Write
◦
H
=
◦
H
n−1
×◦
J
n−1
◦
J.
Thus,
we
have
an
exact
sequence
of
proﬁnite
groups
1
−→
◦
J
n/n−1
−→
◦
H
−→
◦
H
n−1
−→
1.
Then
it
follows
immediately
from
the
condition
imposed
above
on
◦
J,
together
with
the
induction
hypothesis,
that
[by
taking
◦
J
n−1
to
be
suﬃciently
small]
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
◦
H
satisﬁes
conditions
(a)
and
(c)
of
Deﬁnition
3.10
[hence
also
(d)
of
Remark
3.10.1,
(i)].
On
the
other
hand,
by
considering
the
quotient
◦
out
H

(◦
J
n/n−1
){l}

(◦
H
n−1
){l}
[i.e.,
that
arises
from
the
fact
that
◦
H
satisﬁes
condition
(d)
of
Remark
3.10.1,
(i)
—
cf.
also
the
discussion
entitled
“Topological
groups”
in
[CbTpI],
§0],
we
conclude
that
the
natural
homomorphism
(◦
J
n/n−1
){l}
→
(◦
H){l}
induced
by
the
natural
inclusion
◦
J
n/n−1
→
◦
H
is
injective.
Thus,
one
veriﬁes
easily
from
Lemma
1.2,
(i)
[where
we
take
“(G,
N,
J)”
to
be
(◦
Πn
,
◦
H,
◦
Πn−1
)],
(ii)
[where
we
take
“(G,
N,
H)”
to
be
(◦
Πn
,
◦
H,
◦
Πn/n−1
)],
together
with
our
choice
of
◦
H
n−1
,
that
◦
H
satisﬁes
condition
(b)
of
Deﬁnition
3.10,
i.e.,
that
◦
H
is
l-polystable
type.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved.
Next,
we
verify
assertions
(iii),
(iv).
Let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that,
to
verify
assertions
(iii),
(iv),
it
suﬃces
to
verify
the
following
assertion:
Claim
3.14.A:
Let
◦
J

that
arises
from

Proof.
First,
we
verify
assertion
(i).
Let
◦
J
⊆
◦
Πn
be
an
open
subgroup
of
◦
Πn
.
Then
it
follows
from
Lemma
3.14,
(i),
(ii),
(iii),
that
there
exist
an
open
subgroup
◦
H
⊆
◦
Πn
of
◦
Πn
of
l-polystable

[cf.
Deﬁnition
3.10]
and
an

H-l-system
◦
H

{◦

[cf.
Deﬁnidef
tion
3.11,

such
that
◦
H

•
H

is
of

def
and
•
H
=
{•
H
λ
=
α(◦
H

)}λ∈Λ
is
an
•
H-l-system.
Now
it
follows
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved
that,
to
complete
the
veriﬁcation
of
assertion
(i),
it
suﬃces
to
verify
the
following
assertion:
Claim
3.16.A:
For

the

[cf.

We
verify
Claim
3.16.A
by
induction
on
i.
If
i
=
1,
then
Claim
3.16.A
follows
immediately
from
the
equivalence
(a)
⇔
(b∃
)
of
Theorem
3.9,
together
with
Remark
3.13.1,
(i).
Now
suppose
that
i
≥
2,
and
that
the
induction
hypothesis
is
in
force.
Then
it
follows
immediately
from
the
induction
hypothesis
that,
for
each

i
−

the
isomorphism
∼
◦
H

a

Let

be
elements
that
correspond
via
the
above
bijection,
relative
to
the
◦-,
•-versions
of
the
displayed
bijection
of
Deﬁnition
3.12,
(iv).
Now
since
α
is
{l}-I-admissible,
for


{◦,

there
exist
an
open
subgroup

J

as
in
Deﬁnition

such
that
◦

is

relative
to

with

ρ.
Thus,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
∼
involved
that
the
isomorphism

H

In

Thus,
it

from

Theorem

together
with
the

Corollary

Next,
let

in

In

if
either

then,
by
allowing
the
open
subgroup
“◦

of
◦
Πn
to
vary
and
applying
the
group-theoretic
nodality
of
the
resulting

“αi/i−1

one
concludes
from
the
“existence
of

[cf.
the

of

that

Thus,
by

we
conclude
immediately
from

This

the

of

Next,
we

The

as
well
as

[cf.

In

the

gives
rise

Here,
we
recall
further
that
this

is
completely
determined
by
the
set
of

of
the

together
with
the

Assertion

have
equalities
OutFC

=

OutFC

Indeed,
this
follows
immediately
—
in
light
of
the
deﬁnition
of
Iadmissibility,
{l}-I-admissibility
[cf.
Deﬁnition

from

This
completes
the

of
Claim

Next,
we

that
the

We
have
equalities
OutFC

=

Indeed,
the
ﬁrst
four
equalities
follow
from
Claims
3.17.A,
3.17.B.
On
the
other
hand,
the
ﬁnal
inclusion
follows
immediately
from
Proposition
3.16,
(i)
[cf.
also
the
ﬁnal
portion
of

This
completes
the
proof
of
Claim
3.17.C.
Next,
we
claim
that
the
following
assertion
holds:
Claim
3.17.D:
We

Indeed,
let
us
observe
that
the
left-hand
upper
inclusion
follows
immediately
from
Claim
3.17.C.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
the
left-hand
lower
inclusion
follows
immediately
from
assertion
(i).
On
the
other
hand,
the
remaining
inclusions
follow
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved.
This
completes
the
proof
of
Claim
3.17.D.
The
various
equalities
and
inclusions
of
assertion
(ii)
that
precede
assertion
(ii-a)
all
follow
from
Claims
3.17.C,
3.17.D.
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii-a).
It
follows
immediately
from
Proposition
3.16,
(i),
that
the
inclusion
OutF
{l}-I
(Πn
)
⊆
Out{l}-G
(Πn
)
holds.
In
particular,
it
follows
from
Remark
3.13.1,
(ii),
that
the
inclusion
OutF
{l}-I
(Πn
)
⊆
OutFC
(Πn
),
hence
also
the
equality
OutF
{l}-I
(Πn
)
=
OutFC
{l}-I
(Πn
),
holds.
Thus,
the
ﬁrst
two
equalities
of
assertion
(ii-a)
follow
immediately
from
Claims
3.17.C,
3.17.D.
On
the
other
hand,
the
ﬁnal
two
equalities
of
assertion
(ii-a)
follow
immediately
from
the
ﬁnal
portion
of
assertion
(i).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii-a).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii-b).
If
p
∈
Σ,
then
assertion
(ii-b)
follows
from
assertion
(ii-a).
Thus,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
p
∈
Σ.
Then
since
[by
assumption!]
Σ
=
{l},
the
ﬁrst
equality
of
assertion
(ii-b)
follows
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved.
On
the
other
hand,
the
ﬁnal
two
equalities
follow
immediately
from
assertion
(i),
together
with
[CbTpI],
Theorem
A,
(ii).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii-b).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii-c).
If
n
≥
3
and
(r,
n)
=
(0,
3),
then
assertion
(ii-c)
follows
immediately
from
[CbTpII],
Theorem
A,
(ii),
together
with
Claim
3.17.C.
On
the
other
hand,
if
p
∈
Σ
and
n
=
1,
then
assertion
(ii-c)
follows
immediately
from
the
ﬁnal
portion
of
assertion
(i),
together
with
Claim
3.17.C
[cf.
also
Remark
3.13.1,
(ii)].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii-c),
hence
also
of
assertion
(ii).
Next,
we
verify
assertion
(iii).
First,
we
claim
that
the
following
assertion
holds:
Claim
3.17.E:
We
have
an
equality
Out{l}-I
(Π1

=
NOut(Π1

(ρ1

Indeed,
let

we
have
a

log
that,
in
light
of
our
assumption
that
XK
extends
to
a
stable
log
curve
over
(Spec
R)log
,
it
follows
from
[CbTpI],
Deﬁnition
5.3,
(i),
that
the
image
of
ρ1
is
contained
in
∼
Dehn(G
Π1
[Σ])
⊆
Out(ΠG
Π1
[Σ]
)
←
Out(Π1
)
[cf.
[CbTpI],
Deﬁnition
4.4]
and,
moreover,
is
pro-cyclic.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
it
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
{l}-Iadmissibility
that
NOut(Π1
)
(ρ1
(IK
)[l])
⊆
Out{l}-I
(Π1
).
Thus,
to
complete
the
veriﬁcation
of
Claim
3.17.E,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
we
have
an
inclusion
Out{l}-I
(Π1
)
⊆
NOut(Π1
)
(ρ1
(IK
)[l]).
Let
α
∈
Out{l}-I
(Π1
)
and
H
⊆
Π1
a
characteristic
open
subgroup
of
Π1
.
Write
Π1

Π∗1
for
the
maximal
almost
pro-l
quotient
of
Π1
with
respect
to
H
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.1];
ΠG
Π1
[Σ]

Π∗G
Π
[Σ]
for
the
[necessarily
1
maximal
almost
pro-l]
quotient
of
ΠG
Π1
[Σ]
corresponding
to
Π1

Π∗1
∼
[relative
to
the
above
natural
outer
isomorphism
Π1
→
ΠG
Π1
[Σ]
].
Then
it
follows
immediately
[in
light
of
the
well-known
simple
structure
of
pro-cyclic
proﬁnite
groups]
from
the
deﬁnition
of
{l}-I-admissibility
that
there
exists
an
open
subgroup
J
⊆
IK
such
that
the
image
of
ρ1
(J)
in
Out(Π∗1
)
is
normalized
by
the
outomorphism
α∗
∈
Out(Π∗1
)
determined
by
α
∈
Out(Π1
).
On
the
other
hand,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
above
discussion
that
the
outer
representation
∼
ρ1
(J)
−→
Out(Π∗1
)
−→
Out(Π∗G
Π
[Σ]
)
1
is
of
PIPSC-type
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.6,
(iv)].
Thus,
it
follows
from
Theorem
1.11,
(ii),
that
α∗
∈
Out(Π∗1
)
is
group-theoretical
verticial
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.6,
(ii)].
In
particular,
by
allowing
H
to
vary,
we
conclude
that
α
∈
Out(Π1
)
is
group-theoretical
verticial.
Thus,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
a
proﬁnite
Dehn
multi-twist
that
∼
α
∈
Out(Π1
)
normalizes
Dehn(G
Π1
[Σ])
⊆
Out(ΠG
Π1
[Σ]
)
←
Out(Π1
),
hence
also
[cf.
[CbTpI],
Theorem
4.8,
(iv)]
the
maximal
pro-l
subgroup
Dehn(G
Π1
[Σ])[l]
of
Dehn(G
Π1
[Σ]).
On
the
other
hand,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
again
from
[CbTpI],
Theorem
4.8,
(iv),
that
Dehn(G
Π1
[Σ])[l]
is
a
free
Zl
-module
of
ﬁnite
rank,
and
that
the
composite
Dehn(G
Π1
[Σ])[l]
→
Out(Π1
)
→
Out(Π∗1
)
is
injective.
Thus,
since
some
open
subgroup
of
the
maximal
pro-l
subgroup
of
the
image
of
IK
in
Out(Π∗1
)
is
normalized
by
α∗
∈
Out(Π∗1
)
[cf.
the
above
discussion
concerning
“J”!],
one
veriﬁes
immediately
[from
well-known
elementary
properties
of
free
Zl
-modules
of
ﬁnite
rank]
that
α
∈
NOut(Π1
)
(ρ1
(IK
)[l]).
This
completes
the
proof
of
Claim
3.17.E.
Now
let
us
observe
that
one
veriﬁes
easily
[cf.
also
the
discussion
of
the
inclusion
“NOut(Π1
)
(ρ1
(IK
)[l])
⊆
Out{l}-I
(Π1
)”
in
the
proof
of
Claim
3.17.E]
that
the
inclusions

(ρn

⊆
OutF

⊆

hold.
In
particular,
assertion
(iii-a)
follows
immediately
from
Claim
3.17.E,
together
with
the
injectivity
portion
of
[CbTpII],
Theorem
A,
(i)
[cf.
also
[CbTpI],
Theorem
A,
(ii);
[NodNon],
Theorem
B,
in
the
case
where
r
=
0].
Thus,
to
complete
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii),
it
suﬃces
to
verify
the
two
equalities
of
assertion
(iii-b)
in
the
case
where
(r,
n)
=
(0,
2).
Suppose
that
(r,
n)
=
(0,
2),
hence
that
Σ
=
{l}.
Then
one
veriﬁes
easily
that,
to
complete
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii),
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
OutF
{l}-I
(Πn
)
⊆
NOutF
(Πn
)
(ρn
(IK
)[l]).
Thus,
let
α

∈
Aut(Πn
)
be
a
lifting
of
an
element
α
∈
OutF
{l}-I
(Πn
).
Then
let
us
observe
that
it
follows
immediately
from
Claim
3.17.E
that
out
α

induces
an
automorphism
β
of
the
extension
group
Π1

ρ1
(IK
)[l]
[i.e.,
arising
from
the
outer
representation
of
IPSC-type
ρ1
(IK
)
→
Out(Π1
)
implicit
in
the
discussion
surrounding
Claim
3.17.E
above],
whose
restriction
to
Π1
is
G-admissible
[cf.
assertion
(i)].
In
particular,
out
it
follows
that
β
maps
verticial
inertia
groups
of
Π1

ρ1
(IK
)[l]
[each
of
which
surjects
onto
ρ1
(IK

—
cf.
[NodNon],
Deﬁnition
2.2,
(i);
[NodNon],
Deﬁnition
2.4,
(ii);
[NodNon],
Remark
2.4.2]
to
verticial
inout
ertia
groups
of
Π1

ρ1
(IK
)[l].
Moreover,
let
us
observe
that
it
follows
immediately
from
the
fact
that
α
∈
OutF
{l}-I
(Πn
)
that
β
is
compatible
with
the
natural
outer
representations
of
suitable
open
subgroups
out
of
such
verticial
inertia
groups
of
Π1

ρ1
(IK
)[l]
on
Π2/1
[relative
to
the
action
of
α

on
Π2/1
].
Thus,
since
the
natural
outer
representation
out
of
such
a
verticial
inertia
group
of
Π1

ρ1
(IK
)[l]
on
Π2/1
is
[easily
veriﬁed
to
be]
an
outer
representation
of
IPSC-type,
one
concludes
from
a
similar
argument
to
the
[ﬁnal
portion
of
the]
argument
applied
above
to
verify
Claim
3.17.E
that
β
is
compatible
with
these
natural
out
outer
representations
of
verticial
inertia
groups
of
Π1

ρ1
(IK
)[l]
on

on
Π2/1
].
Now
it
follows
formally
Π2/1
[relative
to
the
action
of
α
that
α
∈
NOutF
(Πn
)
(ρn
(IK
)[l]),
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
of
(iii).
Next,
we
verify
assertion
(iv).
The
closedness
of
Out(Π1
)G
in
Out(Π1
)
follows
immediately
from
condition
(c∀
)
of
Proposition
3.6
[cf.
Proposition
3.6,
(ii)].
Thus,
the
closedness
of
Out(Π1
)M
in
Out(Π1
)
follows
from
the
easily
veriﬁed
fact
that
OutM
(Π1
)
is
closed
in
Out(Π1
)G
.
The
fact
that
the
subgroup
Out{l}-I
(Π1
),
hence
also
OutI
(Π1
),
is
closed
in
Out(Π1
)
may
be
veriﬁed
as
follows:
If
p
∈
Σ,
then
the
closedness
in

follows
from
the
closedness
of
Out(Π1

[veriﬁed
above],
together
with
the
ﬁnal
portion
of
assertion
(i).
On
the
other
hand,
if
p
∈

then
the
closedness
in

follows
immediately
from
assertion
(iii).
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
closedness
of
Out{l}-I
(Π1

and
OutI
(Π1

in
Out(Π1

,
OutF
(Πn

from
the

deﬁnitions

the

of
Out(Π1

,
OutI
(Π1

and
Out{l}-I

in

[veriﬁed

The
closedness
of
OutFCI
(Πn

OutFC
{l}-I
(Πn

in
Out(Πn

follow
from
the
closedness
of

(Πn

in
Out(Πn
)
[veriﬁed
above],
together
with
the
equalities
at
the
beginning
of
assertion
(ii).
Next,
we
verify
the
closedness
of
OutG
(Πn
),
Out{l}-G
(Πn
)
in
Out(Πn
).
Let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
it
is
immediate
that,
to
verify
the
desired
closedness,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
the
closedness
of
Out{l}-G
(Πn
)
in
Out(Πn
).
Next,
to
verify
the
closedness
of
Out{l}-G
(Πn
)
in
Out(Πn
),
let
(αξ
)ξ≥1
be
a
sequence
[indexed
by
the
positive
integers]
of
elements
∈
Out{l}-G
(Πn
)
that
converges
to
an
element
α∞
∈
Out(Πn

Then
since
[one
veriﬁes
easily
that]
the
subgroup
of
Out(Πn
)
consisting
of
SAF-admissible
outomorphisms
is
closed,
α∞
is
SAF-admissible.
Next,
to
verify
that
α∞
satisﬁes
the
condition
of
Deﬁnition
3.13,
(ii),
let
us
ﬁx
an
open
subgroup
J
⊆
Πn
of
Πn
.
Now
we
deﬁne
open
subgroups
Hξ
⊆
Jξ
⊆
Πn
of
Πn
inductively
on
ξ
as
follows:
def
•
Set
J1
=
J.
•
Suppose
that
Jξ
⊆
Πn
has
already
been
deﬁned.
Then
since
αξ
is
{l}-G-admissible,
there
exists
an
open
subgroup
H
⊆
◦
Πn
of
◦
Πn
of
l-polystable
type
such
that
H
⊆
Jξ
,
and,
moreover,
αξ
satisﬁes
the
condition
of
Deﬁnition
3.13,
(ii),
in
the
case
where
we
take
the
“(◦
J,
◦
H)”
of
Deﬁnition
3.13,
(ii),
to
be
(Jξ
,
H).
def
Then
deﬁne
Hξ
=
H.
•
Suppose
that
ξ
≥
2,
and
that
Hξ−1
⊆
Πn
has
already
been
def
deﬁned.
Then
set
Jξ
=
Hξ−1
.
Then
it
follows
immediately
from
Lemma
3.14,
(iii),
(v),
that
α∞
satisﬁes
the
condition
of
Deﬁnition
3.13,
(ii),
in
the
case
where
we
take
the
“(◦
J,
◦
H)”
of
Deﬁnition
3.13,
(ii),
to
be
(J
=
J1
,
H
=
H1
).
In
particular,
the
SAF-admissible
outomorphism
α∞
is
{l}-G-admissible,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
closedness
of
Out{l}-G
(Πn
)
in
Out(Πn
).
The
fact
that
the
subgroup
OutF
{l}-I
(Πn

hence
also
OutFI
(Πn

is
closed
in
Out(Πn

may
be
veriﬁed
as
follows:
If
n
=
1,
then
the
closedness
in
question
has
already
been
veriﬁed.
If
p
∈
Σ,
then
the
closedness
in

follows
from
the
closedness
of

together
with
assertion
(ii-a).
On
the
other
hand,
if
p
∈
Σ,
then
the
closedness
in
question
follows
from
assertion
(iii-b).
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
closedness
of
OutF
{l}-I
(Πn
),
OutFI
(Πn
)
in
Out(Πn

hence
also
of
assertion
(iv).
Next,
we
verify
assertion
(v).
Let
α
∈
COutF
(Πn

(OutG
(Πn

(respectively,
COutF
(Πn

(Out{l}-G
(Πn

(OutFC

and
α
∈
F
Aut

a
lifting
of
α.
Now
observe
that
to
complete
the
veriﬁcation
of
assertion
(v),
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
α
∈
Out{l}-G
(Πn
).
To
this
end,
let
J
⊆
Πn
be
an
open
subgroup
of
Πn
.
Then
it
follows
from
Lemma
3.14,
(i),
(iii),
that
there
exist
an
open
subgroup
H
⊆
J
⊆
Πn
of
Πn
of
l-polystable
type
[cf.
Deﬁnition
3.10]
and
an
H-l-system
H
=
{Hλ
}λ∈Λ
[cf.
Deﬁnition
3.11,
(ii)].
Note
that
it
follows
from
condition
(a)
of
Deﬁnition
3.10
that
the
subgroups
H,
Hλ
of
Πn
are
stabilized
by
α
.
Then
it
follows
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved
that,
to
complete
the
veriﬁcation
of
the
fact
that
α
∈
Out{l}-G
(Πn

it
suﬃces
to
verify
the
following
assertion:

the

(Hλ

for
the

of

Hi

{(Hλ

We
verify
Claim
3.17.F
by
induction
on
i.
If
i

then
Claim
3.17.F
is
immediate.
Now
suppose
that
i
≥

and
that
the

is
in

Then
it
follows
immediately
from
the

that,
for

the

Now
let
us
recall
that
we
have
assumed
that
the
smooth
log
curve
log
XK
arises,
via
base-change,
from
a
smooth
log
curve
over
a
complete
discrete

ﬁeld
whose
residue
ﬁeld
is
ﬁnitely
generated
over
a
ﬁnite

In
particular,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
from
the
openness
of

,
N2
in

(respectively,

OutFC
(Πn

=
OutFC
(Πn

⊆
Out{l}-G
(Πn

[cf.
assertion
(ii)])
that
the
composite
horizontal
arrows
of
the
above
commutative
diagram
factor
through
Aut(Gi,y

Aut(Gi,y
),
respectively,
and,
moreover,
are
l-graphically
full
[i.e.,
in
the
sense
of
[CmbGC],
Deﬁnition
2.3,
(iii)]
—
cf.
the
argument
applied
in
the
proof
of
[CmbGC],
Proposition
2.4,
(v).
Thus,
it
follows
from
[CmbGC],
Corollary
2.7,
(ii),
that
the
isomorphism
∼
α
y,y
:
ΠGi,y
→
ΠGi,y
is
graphic.
In
particular,
by
allowing
y,
y
to
vary,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved
that
Claim
3.17.F
holds.
This
completes
the
proof
of
Claim
3.17.F,
hence
also
of
assertion
(v).
Assertion
(vi)
follows
from
[NodNon],
Theorem
B;
[CbTpII],
Theorem
A,

This
completes
the

of

Remark
3.17.1.
In
the
notation
of
Theorem
3.17,
suppose
that
we
are
in
the
situation
of
Theorem
3.17,
(v).
Then
it
follows
from
Theorem
3.17,
(v),
that
COutF
(Πn
)
(OutFC
(Πn

)
⊆
OutG
(Πn

On
the
other
hand,
OutFC
(Πn

is
not,
in
general,
commensurably
terminal
in
OutG
(Πn
)
[or
indeed
in
OutF
(Πn
)
or
OutFC
(Πn

Indeed,
suppose,
moreover,
that
we
are
in
the
situation
of
Theorem
3.17,
(iii)
[so
p
∈

and
that
the
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
G
of
pro-Σ
PSC
type
log
determined
by
the
geometric
special
ﬁber
of
the

satisﬁes
the
following
conditions:
•
Vert(G)
=
Node(G)
=
2.
Write
Vert(G)
=
{v1
,
v2
},
Node(G)
=
{e1

e2

•
For
each
i
∈
{1,
2},
V(ei

=
Vert(G)
=
{v1
,
v2
}.
•
There
exists
an
automorphism
of
G
that
induces
a
nontrivial
automorphism
of
Node(G).
Finally,
suppose
that
if
we
write
μX
log
for
the
metric
structure
on
the
K
log
underlying
semi-graph
of
G
associated
to
the
stable

of
XK
[cf.
Deﬁnition
3.5,
(iii)],
then
μX
log
(e1

=
μX
log
(e2
).
[Here,
we
note
that
one
K
K
log
veriﬁes
easily
that
such
a
smooth
log
curve

exists.]
Then
it
follows
immediately
from
the
various
assumptions
imposed
on
the
objects
under
consideration
that
OutFC
(Π1
)M
is
of
index
2,
hence
also
normal,
in
OutG
(Π1

In
particular,
OutFC
(Π1

is
not
normally
terminal,
hence,
a
fortiori,
not
commensurably
terminal,
in
OutG
(Π1

Remark
3.17.2.
In
the
notation
of
Theorem
3.17,
suppose
that
p

It
follows
from
Theorem

(ii-c),
that
if
either
(†1

n
≥

or
n
≥

and
r

then
we
have
equalities
OutF

In
Corollary
2.10,
the
authors
gave
what
may
be
regarded
as
an
almost
pro-l
version
of
the
injectivity
portion
of
[NodNon],
Theorem
B
[i.e.,
the
injectivity
of
the
natural
homomorphism
OutFC
(Πn+1
)
→
OutFC
(Πn

In
fact,
however,
although
a
detailed
exposition
lies
beyond
the
scope
of
the
present
paper
[cf.
the
discussion
of
(iii)
below],
it
seems
quite
likely
that
92
YUICHIRO

it
should
be
possible
to
verify
an
almost
pro-l
version
of
the
injectivity
portion
of
[CbTpII],
Theorem
A,
(i)
[i.e.,
the
injectivity
of
the
natural
homomorphism
OutF
(Πn+1

→
OutF
(Πn
)
for
(r,
n)
=
(0,

Such
an
almost

would
then
imply,
via
a
similar
argument
to
the

applied
in
the

of

[cf.

that
if
either

the

(iii)
The
main
reason
that
the
authors
did
not
go
to
the
trouble
to
verify
the
nine
equalities
of
the
display
of
(i)
under
the
more
general
hypotheses
[i.e.,
(†2
)]
discussed
in
(ii)
is
the
following.
The
main
applications
of
the
theory
developed
in
the
present
paper
are
the
following:
(1)
the
generalization,
given
in
Corollary
3.20
below
[cf.
also
Remark
3.20.1
below],
of
a
result
due
to
Andre
[cf.
[André],
Theorems
7.2.1,
7.2.3]
concerning
the
characterization
of
local
Galois
groups
in
the
global
Galois
image
associated
to
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
a
number
ﬁeld
and
(2)
the
establishment
of
an
appropriate
local
analogue,
satisfying
various
expected
properties,
of
the
GrothendieckTeichmüller
group
[cf.
Remark
3.19.2
below].
The
theory
surrounding
these
applications
[cf.
Theorem
3.18
below]
revolves
around
the
theory
of
the
tripod
homomorphism
developed
in
[CbTpII],
§3.
On
the
other
hand,
this
theory
of
the
tripod
homomorphism
is
only
well-behaved
[cf.
[CbTpII],
Deﬁnition
3.19]
under
the
more
restrictive
hypotheses
[i.e.,
(†1
)]
discussed
in
(i).
Theorem
3.18
(Metric-admissible
outomorphisms
and

In

Next,

Next,

0,r+1
and
Γ0,r
are
center-free
[cf.,
e.g.,
[MzTa],
Proposition
2.2,
(ii)],
it
follows
that
the
respective
subgroups
of
inner
automorphisms
determine
compatialg
alg
alg
ble
injections
Γalg
0,r+1
→
Aut
(Γ0,r+1
),
Γ0,r
→
Aut
(Γ0,r
).
On
the
other
alg
hand,
since
the
natural
surjection
Γalg
0,r+1

Γ0,r
is
far
from
injective,
it
alg
thus
follows
that
the
natural
homomorphism
Aut
(Γalg
0,r+1
)
→
Aut
(Γ0,r
)
also
fails
to
be
injective.
In
particular,
the
proof
given
in
[André]
of
the
injectivity
of
the
ﬁrst
displayed
homomorphism
GT(r+1)
−→
GT(r)
p
p
of
[André],
Proposition
8.6.2,
(1)
—
hence
also
of
•
[André],
Proposition
8.6.2,
(2),
•
[André],
Corollary
8.6.4,
•
the
ﬁnal
portion
of
[André],
Theorem
8.7.1,
and
•
the
portion
of
[André],
Corollary
8.7.2,
concerning
“GT(r)
p
”
—
must
be
considered
incomplete.
Moreover,
although
it
is
not
directly
related
to
the
injectivity
of
the
above
discussion,
we
observe
in
passing
[cf.
Remark
3.19.4
below
for
more
details]
that
the
discussion
of
[André],
§8,
also
contains
another
misleading
error.
Remark
3.19.2.
Recall
that,
relative
to
the
notation
of
the
present
series
of
papers,
the
usual
Grothendieck-Teichmüller
group
corresponds
to
the
group
def
GT
=
OutF
(Πn
)Δ+
=
OutFC
(Πn
)Δ+
discussed
in
Theorem
3.18,
(ii)
[cf.
also
Remark
3.18.1],
in
the
case
where
(g,
r,
Σ)
=
(0,
3,
Primes)
[cf.
[CmbCsp],
Remark
1.11.1].
Thus,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
present
paper,
it
seems
that
one
natural
candidate
for
the
notion
of
a
local
version
of
the
GrothendieckTeichmüller
group
is
the
“metrized
Grothendieck-Teichmüller
group”
def
GTM
=
OutF
(Πn
)MΔ+
=
OutFC
(Πn
)MΔ+
⊆
GT
discussed
in
Theorem
3.18,
(ii),
again
in
the
case
where
(g,
r,
Σ)
=
(0,
3,
Primes).
Here,
we
recall
that
each
of
these
groups
GTM
,
GT
admits
a
natural
proﬁnite
topology,
hence,
in
particular,
is
compact
[cf.
Theorem
3.17,
(iv)],
and,
moreover,
is
independent,
up
to
canonical
isomorphism,
of
the
choice
of
n
≥
1
[cf.
Theorem
3.18,
(ii)].
Finally,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
from
the
existence
of
the
natural
splitting
of
the
split
surjection
discussed
in
Theorem
3.19,
(ii)
[cf.
also
the
discussion
COMBINATORIAL

TOPICS

97
of
the
construction
of
this
splitting
in
the
proof
of
Proposition
3.16,
(ii);
Remark
3.19.3
below]
that,
for
any
positive
integer
n,
one
has
a
natural
inclusion
GTM
→
GT(n+3)
p
[cf.
[André],
Notation
8.6.1],
hence
also
a
natural
inclusion
GTM
→
GTp
[cf.
[André],
Deﬁnition
8.6.3].
In
particular,
one
obtains
a
natural
outer
action
of
GTM
on
the
“tower”
of
tempered
fundamental
groups
“(Γtemp
0,r
)r≥4
”
discussed
in
[André],
Corollary
8.6.4,
i.e.,
in
the
notation
of
Theorem
3.19
of
the
present
paper,
on
the
system
of
tempered
fundamental
groups
{Πtp
n
}n≥1
that
is
manifestly
compatible
with
the
temp
tp
quotients
Πn

Γ0,n+3
[cf.
[André],
§8.5].
Remark
3.19.3.
The
construction
of
the
splitting
Φ
given
in
the
proof
of
Theorem
3.19,
(ii),
appears,
at
ﬁrst
glance,
to
depend
on
the
choice
of
the
prime
l,
as
well
as
on
the
ordering
of
the
n
factors
of
the
conﬁguration
spaces
that
give
rise
to
Πn
,
Πtp
n
.
In
fact,
however,
it
is
not
diﬃcult
to
verify
—
by
•
observing
that
symmetries
[e.g.,
that
arise
from
permutations
of
the
n
factors]
of
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
the
various
conﬁguration
spaces
over
ﬁelds
that
appear
always
extend
to
symmetries
of
the
corresponding
stable
polycurves
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
3.10.1,
(i),
(e);
[ExtFam],
Theorem
A];
•
applying
the
functoriality
of
the
various
constructions
involved
[cf.
the
discussion
of
“functorial
bijections”
in
the
proof
of
Proposition
3.6]
to
relate
the
“decomposition
groups”
of
the
various
strata
that
appear
in
the
proof
of
Proposition
3.16,
(ii);
and
•
observing
that
these
strata
may
be
described
in
terms
of
“jumps”
in
the
rank
of
the
group-characteristic
sheaf
[cf.
[MzTa],
Definition
5.1,
(i)]
associated
to
the
log
structure
of
the
stable
polycurves
that
appear
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Remark
3.10.1,
(i),
(e)],
hence
are
independent
of
the
ordering
of
the
n
factors
of
the
conﬁguration
spaces
that
appear
—
that
Φ
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
l,
as
well
as
of
the
ordering
of
the
n
factors
of
the
conﬁguration
spaces
that
give
rise
to
Πn
,
Πtp
n
.
Remark
3.19.4.
In
passing,
we
observe,
relative
to
the
discussion
of
[André],
§8,
that
the
second
isomorphism
Out
π1top
((P1C
)an
\
{x1
,
.
.
.
,
xr
})
∼
=
Ker[OutFr−1

98
YUICHIRO
HOSHI
AND

MOCHIZUKI
of
the
ﬁnal
display
of
[André],
§8.2,
is
false
as
stated
and
should
be
replaced
by
an
inclusion
arrow
“→”.
Indeed,
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
the
ﬁrst
isomorphism
of
the
ﬁnal
display
of
[André],
§8.2,
is
correct
as
stated
—
and
indeed
is
a
special
case
of
the
well-known
theorem
of
Dehn-Nielsen-Baer
—
if
one
interprets
the
phrase
“local
monodromies”
in
the
deﬁnition
of
“Out
”
as
referring
to
generators
γi
of
the
inertia
def
groups
at
the
points
xi
.
Write
Π
=
π1top
((P1C
)an
\
{x1
,
.
.
.
,
xr
}).
Then
the
falsity
of
the
second
isomorphism
—
i.e.,
the
non-surjectivity
of
∼
the
natural
inclusion
“→”
induced
by
an
isomorphism
Π
→
Fr−1
—
may
be
veriﬁed
as
follows.
First,
we
observe
that
if
one
assumes
the
surjectivity
of
this
natural
inclusion,
then
it
follows
that
the
subgroup
Out
(Π)
⊆
Out(Π)
is
normal.
Thus,
it
suﬃces
to
obtain
a
contradiction
under
the
assumption
that
the
subgroup
Out
(Π)
⊆
Out(Π)
is
normal.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
the
discrete
free
group
Π
on
r
−
1
generators
is
generated
by
γ1
,
.
.
.
,
γr−1
.
In
particular,
for
any
element
δ
∈
Π
that
appears
as
one
of
a
collection
of
r
−
1
generators
of
Π,
there
exists
an
element
φ
∈
Out(Π)
such
that
φ(δ)
=
γ1
.
Thus,
since
Out
(Π)
⊆
Out(Π)
is
normal,
it
follows
that
any
element
of
Out
(Π)
preserves
the
def
def
conjugacy
class
of
δ.
Write
δ1
=
γ1
·γ2
;
for
i
=
2,
.
.
.
,
r−3,
δi
=
δi−1
·γi
.
Then,
by
taking
“δ”
to
be
δ1
,
.
.
.
,
δr−3
,
we
conclude
that
any
element
of
Out
(Π)
preserves
the
conjugacy
classes
of
each
of
δ1
,
.
.
.
,
δr−3
.
On
the
other
hand,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that,
for
a
standard
choice
of
generators
γ1
,
.
.
.
,
γr−1
,
the
elements
δ1
,
.
.
.
,
δr−3
may
be
regarded
as
generators
of
the
nodal
inertia
groups
associated
to
the
nodes
that
appear
in
a
totally
degenerate
pointed
stable
curve
[over
the
ﬁeld
of
complex
numbers]
that
arises
as
a
degeneration
of
the
pointed
stable
curve
corresponding
to
the
given
Riemann
surface
(P1C
)an
.
Thus,
it
follows
from
[CbTpIV],
Corollary
2.19,
(i);
[CmbGC],
Theorem
1.6,
(ii);
[CmbGC],
Proposition
1.3,
that
any
element
of
Out
(Π)
is
graphic,
i.e.,
in
particular,
preserves
the
conjugacy
classes
of
the
verticial
and
nodal
subgroups
of
Π
that
arise
from
this
totally
degenerate
structure.
On
the
other
hand,
in
light
of
[CbTpIV],
Corollary
2.21,
(iii);
[CbTpIV],
Theorem
2.24,
(ii),
this
implies
that
Out
(Π)
is
an
extension
of
a
ﬁnite
group
by
an
abelian
group,
i.e.,
in
contradiction
to
the
fact
that
Out
(Π)
admits
a
surjection
to
a
[highly
nonabelian!]
discrete
free
group
of
rank
≥
2.
Remark
3.19.5.
Finally,
in
passing,
we
note
the
following
consequence,
in
the
context
of
[Tsjm],
of
the
theory
developed
in
the
present
paper.
Suppose,
in
the
notation
of
Theorem
3.18,
(i),
that
n
≥
4
or
r
>
0.
Then
the
homomorphism

(Πn

Out(Πtpd

of

a

In

with
the
restriction
to

of
the

[cf.

we

Assertion

Finally,
we

First,
let
us
observe
that
if
the
smooth

curve
“XFlog

is
the
smooth
log
curve
associated
to

\
{0,

then
assertion

follows
immediately
from

Theorem

Write
(XF

for

Then
it

immediately
from

that

be

Moreover,
it

immediately
from

that
the

Thus,
to

possibly
smaller
group
Out(π1
(XFlog

⊆
Out(π1

Here,
we
note
that
unlike
the
subgroups
Gp
⊆
GF
[cf.,
e.g.,
[AbsHyp],
Theorem
1.1.1,
(i)]
and
Out(π1temp

(XFlog

→
Out(π1

⊆
Out(π1

Deﬁnition
3.7,
(i);
Proposition
3.6,
(i);
Remark
3.13.1,
(i);
Theorem
3.17,
(v)],
which
are
commensurably
terminal,
the
subgroup
Out(−)M
⊆
Out(−)
fails,
in
general
[at
least
in
the
pro-l
case],
even
to
be
normally
terminal
[cf.
Remark
3.17.1].
Remark
3.20.2.
Let
us
recall
that,
in
the
proof
of
[NodNon],
Theorem
C,
the
authors
applied
•
the
injectivity
portion
of
the
theory
of
combinatorial
cuspidalization,
together
with
•
the
injectivity
of
the
outer
Galois
representation
associated
to
a
tripod,
to
prove
•
the
injectivity
of
the
outer
Galois
representation
associated
to
an
arbitrary
hyperbolic
curve.
On
the
other
hand,
in
the
proof
of
Corollary
3.20,
the
authors
applied
•
the
[almost
pro-l]
injectivity
portion
of
the
theory
of
combinatorial
cuspidalization
[in
the
form
of
Theorem
3.18,
(i)],
together
with
•
the
characterization
of
the
local
Galois
groups
in
the
global
Galois
image
for
tripods,
to
prove
•
an
analogous
characterization
of
the
local
Galois
groups
in
the
global
Galois
image
for
arbitrary
hyperbolic
curves.

The
formal
similarity
of
these
two
proofs
suggests
that
it
is
perhaps
natural
to
think
of
the
injectivity
portion
of
the
theory
of
combinatorial
cuspidalization
as
a
sort
of
tool
for
reducing
certain
problems
concerning
arbitrary
hyperbolic
curves
to
the
case
of
tripods.
Remark
3.20.3.
By
comparison
to
André’s
original
characterization
of
the
local
Galois
groups
in
the
global
Galois
image
[cf.
[André],
Theorems
7.2.1,
7.2.3],
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
researcher
who
is
interested
only
in
tripods
[i.e.,
not
in
arbitrary
hyperbolic
curves],
the
motivation
for
the
theory
developed
in
the
present
paper
concerning
Out(−)M
may
at
ﬁrst
glance
appear
insuﬃcient.
In
fact,
however,
as
discussed
in
Remarks
3.19.1,
3.19.2,
even
if
one
is
interested
only
in
tripods,
it
is
necessary
to
apply
the
extensive
theory
developed
in
the
present
paper
concerning
Out(−)M
in
order
to
repair
the
mistake
in
[André]
and
realize
the
original
goal
of
the
present
paper,
i.e.,
of
deﬁning
a
suitable
local
analogue
of
the
Grothendieck-Teichmüller
group.
