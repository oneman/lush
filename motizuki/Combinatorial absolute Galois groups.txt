Abstract
In this paper, we give a purely combinatorial/group-theoretic construction of the conjugacy class of subgroups of the Grothendieck-Teichmüller
def
group GT determined by the absolute Galois group GQ = Gal(Q/Q)
[where Q denotes the ﬁeld of algebraic numbers] of the ﬁeld of rational
numbers Q. In fact, this construction also yields, as a by-product, a purely
combinatorial/group-theoretic characterization of the GT-conjugates of
closed subgroups of GQ that are “suﬃciently large” in a certain sense.
We then introduce the notions of TKND-ﬁelds [i.e., “torally Kummernondegenerate ﬁelds”] and AVKF-ﬁelds [i.e., “abelian variety Kummerfaithful ﬁelds”], which generalize, respectively, the notions of “torally
Kummer-faithful ﬁelds” and “Kummer-faithful ﬁelds” [notions that appear in previous work of Mochizuki]. For instance, if we write Qab ⊆ Q
for the maximal abelian extension ﬁeld of Q, then every ﬁnite extension
of Qab is a TKND-AVKF-ﬁeld [i.e., both TKND and AVKF]. We then
apply the purely combinatorial/group-theoretic characterization referred
to above to prove that, if a subﬁeld K ⊆ Q is TKND-AVKF, then the
commensurator in GT of the subgroup GK ⊆ GQ determined by K is
contained in GQ . Finally, we combine this computation of the commensurator with a result of Hoshi-Minamide-Mochizuki concerning GT to prove
a semi-absolute version of the Grothendieck Conjecture for higher dimensional [i.e., of dimension ≥ 2] conﬁguration spaces associated to hyperbolic
curves of genus zero over TKND-AVKF-ﬁelds.

Introduction
The present paper builds on the theory of combinatorial Belyi cuspidalization developed in [Tsjm], §1. The theory of combinatorial Belyi cuspidalization
may be understood as a certain combinatorial version of the theory of Belyi
cuspidalization developed in [AbsTopII], §3.
In the present paper, we apply the theory of combinatorial Belyi cuspidalization to give a purely combinatorial/group-theoretic deﬁnition of a certain
class of closed subgroups “BGT” [cf. Deﬁnition 3.3, (v)] of the GrothendieckTeichmüller group
GT (⊆ Out(Πtpd
n )),
denotes the étale fundamental group of the n-th conwhere, for n ≥ 1, Πtpd
n
ﬁguration space associated to the projective line, minus the three points “0”,
“1”, “∞”, over the ﬁeld of algebraic numbers Q [cf. [CmbCsp], Deﬁnition 1.11,
(i); [CmbCsp], Remark 1.11.1; the ﬁrst display of [HMM], Corollary C]. In the
def

following, we shall also write Πtpd = Πtpd
1 . This class of closed subgroups
“BGT” is deﬁned to be the class of closed subgroups of GT that satisfy certain
properties, which may be summarized roughly as follows:
• the COF-property, i.e., “coﬁltered property” [cf. Deﬁnition 3.3, (ii)]:
for any pair of arithmetic Belyi diagrams [cf. [Tsjm], Deﬁnition 1.4], there
exists an arithmetic Belyi diagram that dominates [cf. Deﬁnition 3.3, (i)]
both of the given arithmetic Belyi diagrams;
• the RGC-property, i.e.,“Relative Grothendieck Conjecture property”
[cf. Deﬁnition 3.3, (iii)]: if there exists a geometric domination between
two arithmetic Belyi diagrams, then it is the unique geometric domination
between the two arithmetic Belyi diagrams.
Our ﬁrst main result is the following [cf. Theorem 4.4]:
2

Theorem A (Combinatorial construction of an algebraic closure of the
ﬁeld of rational numbers). Let BGT ⊆ GT be a closed subgroup that satisﬁes
the COF- and RGC-properties [cf. Deﬁnition 3.3, (ii), (iii), (v)]. Then one
may construct from BGT a ﬁeld
QBGT
isomorphic to the ﬁeld of algebraic numbers Q and a natural homomorphism
def

CGT (BGT) → GQBGT = Aut(QBGT )
from the commensurator of BGT in GT to the group of automorphisms of the
ﬁeld QBGT . [We refer to Theorem F below for a special case, which is of central
interest in the present paper, of this sort of situation.] In particular, one may
construct a natural outer homomorphism
def

CGT (BGT) → GQ = Gal(Q/Q)
from the commensurator of BGT in GT to the absolute Galois group GQ of Q.
At the time of writing, the authors do not know whether or not the outer
homomorphism CGT (BGT) → GQ is injective in general. On the other hand,
by imposing further purely combinatorial/group-theoretic conditions — i.e., the
QAA- and AA-properties [cf. Deﬁnition 5.12; the brief description following
Theorem C below] — on BGT, one may conclude that the following hold [cf.
Theorems 5.15, (ii); 5.17, (i), (ii)]:
Theorem B (Injectivity of the natural homomorphism CGT (BGT) → GQ ).
Let BGT ⊆ GT be a closed subgroup that satisﬁes the COF- and RGC-properties
[cf. Deﬁnition 3.3, (ii), (iii), (v)]. Suppose that BGT satisﬁes the QAAproperty [cf. Deﬁnition 5.12]. Then the natural outer homomorphism
CGT (BGT) → GQ
of Theorem A is injective.
Theorem C (Combinatorial construction of GQ ).
(i) Write Out|C| (Πtpd ) ⊆ Out(Πtpd ) for the closed subgroup of outer automorphisms that induce the identity automorphisms on the set of conjugacy
classes of cuspidal inertia subgroups of Πtpd . Then the conjugacy class
of subgroups of Out|C| (Πtpd ) determined by the absolute Galois group
[cf.
of Q may be constructed from the abstract topological group Πtpd
2
Corollary 4.5, Remark 4.5.1], in a purely combinatorial/group-theoretic
way, as the set of maximal elements [relative to the relation of inclusion]
in the set of closed subgroups of Out|C| (Πtpd ) that arise as Out|C| (Πtpd )conjugates of closed subgroups of GT that satisfy the QAA-property [cf.
Deﬁnitions 3.3, (v); 5.12].

(ii) The conjugacy class of subgroups of GT determined by the absolute
Galois group of Q may be constructed from the abstract topological group
Πtpd
[cf. Corollary 4.5, Remark 4.5.1], in a purely combinatorial/group2
theoretic way, as the set of maximal elements [relative to the relation
of inclusion] in the set of closed subgroups of GT that arise as closed
subgroups of GT that satisfy the AA-property [cf. Deﬁnitions 3.3, (v);
5.12].
The class of closed subgroups “BGT” satisfying the QAA-property [i.e.,
“quasi-algebraically ample property”] (respectively, the AA-property [i.e., “algebraically ample property”]) is deﬁned to be the class of closed subgroups of
GT that satisfy the COF- and RGC-properties, together with certain properties
(i), (ii), (iii) (respectively, (i), (ii), (iii), (iv)), which may be summarized roughly
as follows:
(i) The Kummer theory associated to BGT is suﬃciently nondegenerate.
(ii) The Kummer theory associated to the various arithmetic Belyi diagrams
arising from BGT is suﬃciently nondegenerate.
(iii) There exists a family of QBGT -valued set-theoretic functions on a certain
set of cuspidal inertia subgroups associated to the various arithmetic Belyi diagrams arising from BGT that satisﬁes properties satisﬁed by the
function ﬁelds arising from these arithmetic Belyi diagrams.
(iv) The family of set-theoretic functions in (iii) determines a Galois group
that satisﬁes a certain compatibility property involving Πtpd
2 .
Of course, it is by no means the case that the approach of Theorem C to
constructing the conjugacy class of subgroups of GT determined by GQ is, in any
sense, unique. On the other hand, the approach of Theorem C is an attractive
application of the technique of combinatorial Belyi cuspidalization developed in
[Tsjm], §1. Moreover, the approach of Theorem C has interesting applications,
i.e., Theorems F and G, given below.
The approach of Theorem C to constructing the conjugacy class of subgroups
of GT determined by GQ may be thought of as a sort of
conditional [cf. the condition of maximality within a certain collection of closed subgroups] surjectivity counterpart of the well-known
injectivity result of Belyi, i.e., to the eﬀect that the natural outer
homomorphism GQ → GT is injective, or, alternatively, as one [of
many possible] natural answer(s) to the problem posed by Belyi
in the discussion following the Corollary to [Belyi], Theorem 4, of
giving a group-theoretic description of the image of this outer injection GQ → GT.
The idea that there should exist such a [conditional] surjectivity counterpart of
Belyi injectivity that could be proven by applying Belyi maps in some suitable

4

fashion [i.e., just as in the case of Belyi injectivity!] was motivated in part by
the proofs given in [CmbCsp], §2, §3, of the injectivity/bijectivity of the natural
homomorphism
OutFC (Πn ) → OutFC (Πn−1 )
of [CmbCsp], Theorem A, (i). That is to say, these proofs given in [CmbCsp],
§2, §3, are in some sense remarkable in the sense that
the conditional surjectivity proven in [CmbCsp], §3, is proven by
applying an argument that is entirely similar to the argument applied in the proof of the corresponding injectivity result in [CmbCsp],
§2.
In this context, it is of interest to note that this fascinating general phenomenon
— i.e., of obtaining [conditional] surjectivity results by means of essentially similar arguments to the arguments used to verify corresponding injectivity results
— may also be observed in numerous well-known aspects of algebraic topology, such as the theory of long exact sequences of (co)homology groups and the
homotopy theory of CW-complexes.
The proofs of Theorems B and C depend on the following elementary ﬁeldtheoretic results proven in §1 [cf. Theorem 1.2, Corollary 1.3]:
Theorem D (Non-algebricity of ﬁeld automorphisms of algebraically
closed ﬁelds). Let K be an algebraically closed ﬁeld. Write Aut(K) for the
group of the ﬁeld automorphisms of K. Let α ∈ Aut(K). Write
αΓ : K → K × K = A2 (K)
for the graph of α, i.e., the map K  x → (x, xα ) ∈ K × K. If K is of
characteristic 0 (respectively, p > 0), then we shall write Fr ∈ Aut(K) for the
identity automorphism (respectively, the Frobenius automorphism [i.e., given by
raising to the p-th power]) of K; FrZ ⊆ Aut(K) for the subgroup generated by
Fr. Then the image Im(αΓ ) ⊆ A2 (K) of αΓ is Zariski-dense if and only if
α∈
/ FrZ .
Corollary E (A criterion for the algebricity of certain set-theoretic
def

automorphisms). In the notation of Theorem D, write X = P1K [i.e., the projective line over K]. Let Y → X be a ﬁnite ramiﬁed Galois covering of smooth,
proper, connected curves over K. Write X(K) (respectively, Y (K)) for the set
of K-valued points of X (respectively, Y ); AutX(K) (Y (K)) for the group of bi∼
jections Y (K) → Y (K) which preserve the ﬁbers of the natural map Y (K) →
X(K); K(Y ) for the rational function ﬁeld of Y . For τ ∈ AutX(K) (Y (K)),
f ∈ Fn(Y (K), K ∪ {∞}) [where “Fn(−, −)” denotes the set of maps from the
ﬁrst argument to the second argument], write
f τ = f ◦ τ ∈ Fn(Y (K), K ∪ {∞}).
def

We shall regard K(Y ) as a subset of Fn(Y (K), K ∪ {∞}) by evaluating rational
functions at closed points of Y and Gal(Y /X) as a subgroup of AutX(K) (Y (K))
5

by means of the natural action of Gal(Y /X) on Y (K). Let k ⊆ K be a subﬁeld
such that the covering Y → X descends to a Galois covering Yk → Xk deﬁned
over k, and
(Aut(K) ⊇) Aut(K/k) ⊆ FrZ (⊆ Aut(K)),
where we write Aut(K/k) ⊆ Aut(K) for the subgroup of automorphisms that
restrict to the identity automorphism of k. Let σ ∈ AutX(K) (Y (K)) that satisﬁes
the following property: for each f ∈ K(Y )× , there exist
φf ∈ Fn(Y (K), k × ) (⊆ Fn(Y (K), K ∪ {∞})),

gf ∈ K(Y )×

such that f σ = φf · gf . Then σ ∈ Gal(Y /X).
def

Next, let K ⊆ Q be a subﬁeld. Write GK = Gal(Q/K). If K is stably ×μindivisible [cf. [Tsjm], Deﬁnition 3.3, (v)], then we recall from [Tsjm], Corollary
E, that one may construct a natural homomorphism
CGT (GK ) → GQ
whose restriction to CGQ (GK ) ⊆ CGT (GK ) is the natural inclusion.
In the present paper, we shall say that the subﬁeld K ⊆ Q is an AVKF-ﬁeld
[i.e., “abelian variety Kummer-faithful ﬁeld”] if the following property holds [cf.
Deﬁnition 6.1, (iii)]:
Let A be an abelian variety over a ﬁnite extension L of K. Write
A(L)∞ for the group of divisible elements ∈ A(L). Then A(L)∞ =
{1}.
Here, we recall in passing that any ﬁnite extension of the maximal abelian
extension ﬁeld Qab ⊆ Q of Q is a stably ×μ-indivisible AVKF-ﬁeld [cf. [Tsjm],
Theorem 3.1, and its proof; [Tsjm], Remark 3.4.1]. On the other hand, it is not
clear to the authors at the time of writing
• whether or not there exist AVKF-ﬁelds that are not stably ×μ-indivisible;
• whether or not there exist stably ×μ-indivisible ﬁelds that are not AVKF.
If K is an AVKF-ﬁeld, then GK satisﬁes the COF- and RGC-properties [cf.
Corollary 6.5], hence may be taken to be the subgroup “BGT” of Theorem
A. In particular, by applying Theorem A, one may also construct a natural
homomorphism
CGT (GK ) → GQ
whose restriction to CGQ (GK ) ⊆ CGT (GK ) is the natural inclusion [cf. Corollary
6.5, (iii)].
At the time of writing, the authors do not know whether or not these natural
homomorphisms [i.e., of Corollary 6.5, (iii), and [Tsjm], Corollary E] are injective in general. On the other hand, by imposing a further condition on K, one
may conclude that the natural homomorphism CGT (GK ) → GQ arising from
Corollary 6.5, (iii), is injective [cf. Theorem F below]. We shall say that the
subﬁeld K ⊆ Q is a TKND-ﬁeld [i.e., “torally Kummer-nondegenerate ﬁeld”] if
the following property holds [cf. Deﬁnition 6.6, (iii)]:
6

Write

def

Kdiv =



L×∞ ⊆ Q,

L/K

where L ⊆ Q ranges over the ﬁnite extensions of K, and we write

def
def
def
L× = L \ {0}, L×∞ =
(L× )m , L×∞ = Q(L×∞ ) ⊆ L.
m≥1

Then Q is an inﬁnite ﬁeld extension of Kdiv .
We shall say that the subﬁeld K ⊆ Q is a TKND-AVKF-ﬁeld if K is both TKND
and AVKF. Our main result concerning TKND-AVKF-ﬁelds is the following [cf.
Theorem 6.8]:
Theorem F (Injectivity of the natural homomorphism CGT (GK ) → GQ ).
Suppose that K ⊆ Q is a TKND-AVKF-ﬁeld. Then GK satisﬁes the AA-,
hence also the COF-, RGC-, and QAA-properties. In particular, [cf. Theorem
B] the natural homomorphism CGT (GK ) → GQ of Theorem A is injective and
restricts to the natural inclusion GK → GQ on GK ⊆ CGT (GK ).
Theorem F is proved by applying the theory developed in §3, §4, §5 of the
present paper, i.e., the theory that underlies the proof of Theorem C [cf. the
discussion surrounding Theorem C].
Finally, by combining Theorem F with certain combinatorial anabelian results proven in §2 of the present paper and applying a result of Hoshi-MinamideMochizuki [cf. the ﬁrst display of [HMM], Corollary C], we obtain a semiabsolute version of the Grothendieck Conjecture for the higher dimensional (of
dimension ≥ 2) conﬁguration spaces [cf. [MT], Deﬁnition 2.1, (i)] associated to
hyperbolic curves of genus 0 over K [cf. Theorem 6.10, (ii)]:
Theorem G (Semi-absolute Grothendieck Conjecture-type result over
TKND-AVKF-ﬁelds). Let (m, n) be a pair of positive integers; K, L ⊆ Q
TKND-AVKF-ﬁelds; XK (respectively, YL ) a hyperbolic curve over K (respectively, L). Write gX (respectively, gY ) for the genus of XK (respectively,
YL ); (XK )m (respectively, (YL )n ) for the m-th (respectively, n-th) conﬁguradef

tion space associated to XK (respectively, YL ); GK = Gal(Q/K) (respectively,
def

GL = Gal(Q/L));

Out(Π(XK )m /GK , Π(YL )n /GL )
∼

for the set of outer isomorphisms Π(XK )m → Π(YL )n that induce outer isomorphisms between GK and GL . Then the following hold:
(i) Suppose that
• m ≥ 4 or n ≥ 4 if X or Y is proper;
• m ≥ 3 or n ≥ 3 if X or Y is aﬃne.

7

Then the outer isomorphism
∼

GK → G L
induced by any outer isomorphism ∈ Out(Π(XK )m /GK , Π(YL )n /GL ) arises
∼
from a ﬁeld isomorphism K → L.
(ii) Suppose that
• m ≥ 2 or n ≥ 2;
• gX = 0 or gY = 0.
Then the natural map
Isom((XK )m , (YL )n ) −→ Out(Π(XK )m /GK , Π(YL )n /GL )
is bijective.
In this context, we observe that any ﬁnite extension K of Qab is a TKNDAVKF-ﬁeld [cf. Proposition 6.3, (i); Remark 6.6.3]. Other interesting examples
of TKND-AVKF-ﬁelds are given in Proposition 6.3, (ii) [cf. also Remarks 6.3.3,
6.3.4, 6.3.5, 6.6.3, 6.6.4]. In particular, we observe [cf. Remark 6.3.5] that
Theorem G constitutes an interesting example of [semi-absolute]
anabelian geometry over ﬁelds that cannot be treated by means of
well-known techniques of anabelian geometry that require the use of
p-adic Hodge theory or Frobenius elements of absolute Galois
groups of ﬁnite ﬁelds [cf. [Tama], Theorem 0.4; [LocAn], Theorem
A; [AnabTop], Theorem 4.12].
Next, suppose that K is a sub-p-adic subﬁeld [cf. [LocAn], Deﬁnition 15.4,
(i)] of Q, i.e., [as is easily veriﬁed] a subﬁeld of Q that is isomorphic to a subﬁeld
of a ﬁnite extension of the ﬁeld of p-adic numbers Qp , for some prime number p.
Then K is a Kummer-faithful ﬁeld [cf. [AbsTopIII], Deﬁnition 1.5; [AbsTopIII],
Remark 1.5.4, (i)], hence, in particular, a TKND-AVKF-ﬁeld. Thus, Theorem
G may be regarded as a sort of partial generalization of [AbsTopIII], Theorem
1.9. On the other hand, let us recall that the proof of [AbsTopIII], Theorem
1.9, depends, in an essential way, on [LocAn], Theorem A, hence, in particular,
on Faltings’ p-adic Hodge theory. By contrast, we observe [cf. Remark 3.3.2]
that
the proof of Theorem G [say, in the case where K and L are assumed to be sub-p-adic subﬁelds of Q] is based solely on results and
techniques from combinatorial anabelian geometry and hence
is, in particular, entirely independent of results concerning the
Grothendieck Conjecture for hyperbolic curves over sub-padic ﬁelds [i.e., [LocAn], Theorem A; [Tama], Theorem 0.4].
Moreover, unlike, for instance, [LocAn], Theorem A; [Tama], Theorem 0.4;
[AbsCsp], Theorem 3.2,
8

the proof of Theorem G [say, in the case where K and L are assumed
to be sub-p-adic local subﬁelds of Q] does not involve the use of any
arguments involving theories of “weights”, i.e., theories such as
Faltings’ p-adic Hodge theory or the Weil Conjectures.
Here, we recall that a somewhat weaker version of Theorem G in the case
where m = n = 1 and K and L are assumed to be stably p-×μ/×μ-indivisible
ﬁelds of characteristic 0 [cf. [Tsjm], Deﬁnition 3.3, (v)], i.e., but not necessarily
to be TKND-AVKF, is given in [Tsjm], Theorem F. Also, we recall that a version
of Theorem G in the case where m = n = 1 and K and L are assumed to be
generalized sub-p-adic may be found in [Hsh2], Corollary 5.6, (ii), (iii).
This paper is organized as follows. In §1, we prove Theorem D and Corollary
E, which will be of use in §5. In §2, we give some preliminaries on combinatorial
anabelian geometry which will be of use in the later sections. In §3, we give a
purely combinatorial/group-theoretic deﬁnition of a certain class of closed subgroups BGT of GT [cf. the discussion preceding Theorem A]. In §4, for each such
closed subgroup BGT ⊆ GT, we give a purely combinatorial/group-theoretic
construction of a ﬁeld QBGT that is isomorphic to the ﬁeld of algebraic numbers
Q and, moreover, equipped with a natural action by CGT (BGT). In particular, we obtain a natural outer homomorphism CGT (BGT) → GQ [cf. Theorem
A]. In §5, by imposing on BGT certain further combinatorial/group-theoretic
conditions, we obtain a certain class of closed subgroups BGT [cf. the discussion following Theorem C] — whose deﬁnition is purely combinatorial/grouptheoretic — for which the natural outer homomorphism CGT (BGT) → GQ is
injective [cf. Theorem B]. Moreover, we obtain Theorem C as a consequence of
this injectivity. Finally, in §6, we study various types of ﬁelds and apply the
theory of §1, §2, §3, §4, §5, to prove Theorems F and G.

If K is an extension ﬁeld of F , then we shall write Aut(K/F ) ⊆ Aut(K) for the
subgroup of automorphisms that restrict to the identity automorphism of F .
Topological groups: Let G be a topological group and H ⊆ G a closed
subgroup of G. Then we shall denote by ZG (H) (respectively, NG (H); CG (H))
the centralizer (respectively, normalizer; commensurator) of H ⊆ G, i.e.,
def

ZG (H) = {g ∈ G | ghg −1 = h for any h ∈ H}
def

(respectively, NG (H) = {g ∈ G | g · H · g −1 = H};
def

CG (H) = {g ∈ G | H ∩ g · H · g −1 is of ﬁnite index in H and g · H · g −1 }).
We shall say that the closed subgroup H is normally terminal in G if H =
NG (H). We shall say that the closed subgroup H is commensurably terminal
in G if H = CG (H). We shall say that G is slim if ZG (U ) = {1} for any open
subgroup U of G.
Let G be a topological group. Then we shall write Gab for the quotient
of G by the closure of the commutator subgroup [G, G] ⊆ G; Aut(G) for the
group of [continuous] automorphisms of G; Inn(G) ⊆ Aut(G) for the group of
def

inner automorphisms of G; Out(G) = Aut(G)/Inn(G). Now suppose that G is
center-free [i.e., ZG (G) = {1}]. Then we have an exact sequence of groups

If J is a group, and ρ : J → Out(G) is a homomorphism, then we shall denote

out

G  J
the group obtained by pulling back the above exact sequence of groups via ρ.
Thus, we have a natural exact sequence of groups
out

1 −→ G −→ G  J −→ J −→ 1
Suppose further that G is proﬁnite and topologically ﬁnitely generated. Then
one veriﬁes immediately that the topology of G admits a basis of characteristic
open subgroups, which thus induces a proﬁnite topology on the groups Aut(G)
and Out(G) with respect to which the above exact sequence relating Aut(G)
and Out(G) determines an exact sequence of proﬁnite groups. In particular, one
veriﬁes easily that if, moreover, J is proﬁnite, and ρ : J → Out(G) is continuous,
out

then the above exact sequence relating G  J to G and J determines an exact
sequence of proﬁnite groups.
Fundamental groups: For a connected Noetherian scheme S, we shall write
ΠS for the étale fundamental group of S, relative to a suitable choice of basepoint.
Schemes: For a morphism of scheme S → T , we shall write AutT (S) for the
group of automorphisms of the T -scheme S. If T = Spec Z, then we shall write
Aut(S) for AutT (S).
Log schemes: We shall, by a slight abuse of notation, regard schemes as log
schemes equipped with the trivial log structure. If S log is a log scheme, then we
shall write S for the underlying scheme of S log and US ⊆ S for the interior of
S log , i.e., the largest open subscheme of S over which the log structure of S log
is trivial.
Curves: We shall use the terms “hyperbolic curve”, “cusp”, “stable log curve”,
“smooth log curve”, and “tripod” as they are deﬁned in [CmbGC], §0; [CmbCsp],
§0. We shall use the terms “n-th conﬁguration space” and “n-th log conﬁguration
space” as they are deﬁned in [MT], Deﬁnition 2.1, (i).

The non-algebricity of ﬁeld automorphisms

In this section, we discuss an interesting elementary property of ﬁeld automorphisms of algebraically closed ﬁelds, namely, that, with the exception of
integral powers of the Frobenius automorphism, such ﬁeld automorphisms cannot be expressed algebraically [cf. Theorem 1.2]. We then apply this property to
give a criterion for the algebricity of certain set-theoretic automorphisms of sets
of rational points of curves valued in algebraically closed ﬁelds [cf. Corollary
1.3]. This criterion will play an important role in the theory to be developed in
the present paper.

Lemma 1.1 (The inversion map on the multiplicative group of a ﬁeld).
Let k be a ﬁeld. Write
∼
σ : k × ∪ {0} → k × ∪ {0}
for the bijection such that
• σ(x) = x−1 for each x ∈ k × ,
• σ(0) = 0.
Then the following hold:
∼

(i) The bijection σ is a ﬁeld automorphism if and only if k → F2 , F3 , or F4 .
∼

∼

(ii) If k → F2 or F3 (respectively, k → F4 ), then σ is the identity (respectively,
the unique non-trivial) automorphism of k.
Proof. First, we verify assertion (i). Suﬃciency is immediate. Next, to verify
necessity, we observe that if σ is a ﬁeld automorphism, then, for x ∈ k \ {0, −1},
1 + x1 = σ(1) + σ(x) = σ(1 + x) =

1
1+x

(⇐⇒ x2 + x + 1 = 0).

Since the equation x2 + x + 1 = 0 has at most 2 solutions in k, we thus conclude
that the cardinality of k is ≤ 4. Assertion (ii) follows immediately from the
deﬁnitions. This completes the proof of Lemma 1.1.

Theorem 1.2 (Non-algebricity of ﬁeld automorphisms of algebraically
closed ﬁelds). Let K be an algebraically closed ﬁeld; α ∈ Aut(K). Write
αΓ : K → K × K = A2 (K)
for the graph of α, i.e., the map K  x → (x, xα ) ∈ K × K. If K is of
characteristic 0 (respectively, p > 0), then we shall write Fr ∈ Aut(K) for the
identity automorphism (respectively, the Frobenius automorphism [i.e., given by
raising to the p-th power]) of K; FrZ ⊆ Aut(K) for the subgroup generated by Fr.
Then the image Im(αΓ ) ⊆ A2 (K) of αΓ is Zariski-dense if and only if α ∈
/ FrZ .
Proof. Necessity is immediate. Thus, it remains to verify suﬃciency. If αΓ is
not Zariski-dense, then there exists a nonzero polynomial

0 = f = f (X, Y ) =
ai,j X i Y j ∈ K[X, Y ]
such that
Im(αΓ ) ⊆ V (f ) ⊆ A2 (K),
where V (f ) denotes the zero set of f . In particular, for x ∈ K, we have

ai,j xi (xj )α = 0.

12

def

For x ∈ K × , write ρi,j (x) = xi (xj )α ∈ K × . Then ρi,j : K × → K × is a
character. Thus, it follows immediately from Artin’s well-known result on the
linear independence of characters that there exist pairs of integers (i1 , j1 ) =
(i2 , j2 ) ∈ N × N such that ρi1 ,j1 = ρi2 ,j2 . In particular, there exists a pair of
integers
(i, j) ∈ Z × Z \ {(0, 0)}
such that

xi = (xj )α

for x ∈ K × . Since K is algebraically closed, it follows that i = 0, j = 0.
Moreover, since K × is divisible, we may assume without loss of generality that
i and j are co-prime.
Now suppose that the characteristic of K is p > 0. Write φi : K × →
×
K (respectively, φj : K × → K × ) for the surjection determined by x → xi
(respectively, x → xj ). Since xi = (xj )α for x ∈ K × , it follows that Ker(φi ) =
Ker(φj ). Since i and j are co-prime, we thus conclude that i, j ∈ {±pZ }.
Moreover, we may assume without loss of generality that j = 1. Thus, by
applying Lemma 1.1, (i), we conclude that α ∈ FrZ .
Next, we consider the case where the characteristic of K is 0. In this case,
we have, for example, 2i = 2j . This implies that i = j. Thus, since i and j
are co-prime, we conclude that α ∈ FrZ . This completes the proof of Theorem
1.2.
Remark 1.2.1.
(i) Theorem 1.2 was in some sense motivated by the following complex analytic
analogue of Theorem 1.2, i.e., the non-holomorphicity of the automorphism
of C given by complex conjugation. Let n be a positive integer; U ⊆
C a nonempty relatively compact open subset; {fj (z)}1≤j≤n a family of
holomorphic functions on U . Write μ for the Lebesgue measure on C;
z ∈ C for the complex conjugate of z ∈ C. Then
∃z ∈ U such that z ∈
/ {fj (z)}1≤j≤n .
Indeed, suppose that z ∈ {fj (z)}1≤j≤n for every z ∈ U . By enlarging
the family of holomorphic functions {fj (z)}1≤j≤n if necessary, we may
assume without loss of generality that it is stabilized by multiplication by
−1. Write
def

gj (z) = fj (z) + z,

def

Ej = {z ∈ U | ± z = fj (z)}.

Then it follows immediately from the deﬁnitions that Ej ⊆ Uis a closed
[hence, in particular, Lebesgue measurable] subset, and U = 1≤j≤n Ej .
Thus, we conclude that

0 < μ(U ) ≤
μ(Ej ) < ∞.
1≤j≤n

13

In particular, there exists an element j ∈ {1, . . . , n} such that μ(Ej ) >
0. Fix such an element j. Since the family of holomorphic functions
{fj (z)}1≤j≤n is stabilized by multiplication by −1, by possibly replacing
j by j  ∈ {1, . . . , n} such that fj (z) = −fj  (z) for z ∈ U [which implies
that Ej = Ej  ], we may assume without loss of generality that√gj (z) is
a non-constant holomorphic function. But then gj (Ej ) ⊆ R ∪ −1 · R,
which implies that
√
0 < μ(gj (Ej )) ≤ μ(R ∪ −1 · R) = 0
— a contradiction!
(ii) Finally, we observe that Theorem 1.2 in the case where K = C, and α is
the automorphism given by complex conjugation follows immediately from
the fact veriﬁed in Remark 1.2.1, (i). Indeed, if αΓ is not Zariski-dense,
then there exists a nonzero polynomial

0 = f = f (X, Y ) =
ai,j X i Y j ∈ C[X, Y ]
such that
Im(αΓ ) ⊆ V (f ) ⊆ A2 (C),
where V (f ) denotes the zero set of f . Since the map V (f ) → C induced
by the ﬁrst projection C × C → C is a nonconstant algebraic map [i.e.,
corresponds to a dominant morphism between one-dimensional schemes
of ﬁnite type over C], there exists a nonempty relatively compact open
subset U ⊆ C such that the induced map
def

V (f )|U = V (f ) ∩ (U × C) → U
determines a split ﬁnite étale morphism of complex analytic spaces. The
ﬁnite collection of sections of this induced map thus determines a family
of holomorphic functions as in Remark 1.2.1, (i). This yields the desired
contradiction.

Corollary 1.3 (A criterion for the algebricity of certain set-theoretic
def

automorphisms). In the notation of Theorem 1.2, write X = P1K [i.e., the
projective line over K]. Let Y → X be a ﬁnite ramiﬁed Galois covering of
smooth, proper, connected curves over K. Write X(K) (respectively, Y (K))
for the set of K-valued points of X (respectively, Y ); AutX(K) (Y (K)) for the
∼
group of bijections Y (K) → Y (K) which preserve the ﬁbers of the natural
map Y (K) → X(K); K(Y ) for the rational function ﬁeld of Y . For τ ∈
AutX(K) (Y (K)), f ∈ Fn(Y (K), K ∪ {∞}), write
f τ = f ◦ τ ∈ Fn(Y (K), K ∪ {∞}).
def

14

We shall regard K(Y ) as a subset of Fn(Y (K), K ∪ {∞}) by evaluating rational
functions at closed points of Y and Gal(Y /X) as a subgroup of AutX(K) (Y (K))
by means of the natural action of Gal(Y /X) on Y (K). Let k ⊆ K be a subﬁeld
such that the covering Y → X descends to a Galois covering Yk → Xk deﬁned
over k, and
(Aut(K) ⊇) Aut(K/k) ⊆ FrZ (⊆ Aut(K)).
Let σ ∈ AutX(K) (Y (K)) that satisﬁes the following property: for each f ∈
K(Y )× , there exist
φf ∈ Fn(Y (K), k × ) (⊆ Fn(Y (K), K ∪ {∞})),

gf ∈ K(Y )×

such that f σ = φf · gf . Then σ ∈ Gal(Y /X).
Proof. Write n for the degree of the covering Y → X; σ1 , . . . , σn for the n
distinct elements of Gal(Y /X). Let α ∈ Aut(K/k) \ FrZ . Write
αΓ,X : X(K) → X(K) × X(K),
αΓ,Y : Y (K) → Y (K) × Y (K)
for the respective graphs of α, i.e., the maps X(K)  x → (x, xα ) ∈ X(K) ×
X(K) and Y (K)  y → (y, y α ) ∈ Y (K) × Y (K). Then it follows immediately
from Theorem 1.2 that the subset Im(αΓ,X ) ⊆ X(K) × X(K) is Zariski-dense
in X(K) × X(K). Next, we observe that
• the covering Y → X, hence also the morphism Y × Y → X × X [i.e., the
product over K of two copies of the covering Y → X] is ﬁnite;
• the map Im(αΓ,Y ) → Im(αΓ,X ) induced by the ﬁnite morphism Y × Y →
X × X is surjective.
Thus, since the Zariski closure of Im(αΓ,Y ) is an algebraic set in Y (K)×Y (K), it
follows immediately from the above observations that Im(αΓ,Y ) is Zariski-dense
in Y (K) × Y (K).
Next, we observe that the existence of the Galois covering Yk → Xk [i.e.,
whose base-change over k to K is the covering Y → X] implies that the natural
action of Aut(K/k) on K induces a natural action of Aut(K/k) on Y (K) that
commutes with the natural action of Gal(Y /X) on Y (K). If, moreover, β ∈
Aut(K/k), h ∈ Fn(Y (K), K ∪ {∞}), then we shall write
hβ = β −1 ◦ h ◦ β ∈ Fn(Y (K), K ∪ {∞}).

Fix such a pair of integers (i, j).

ular, that the morphism ψ is not dominant. On the other hand, if both h†f and

h‡f are nonconstant rational functions, then the morphism ψ is easily veriﬁed to

be dominant. Thus, we conclude that either h†f or h‡f is constant, and hence,

since Im(ψ) ⊆ Δ(K), that both h†f and h‡f are constant. Write cf ∈ K for the

unique constant value of h†f . Thus,

completes the proof of Corollary 1.3.

Remark 1.3.1.
(i) Corollary 1.3 was in some sense motivated by the following complex anadef

lytic analogue of Corollary 1.3. Write S1 = {z ∈ C | |z| = 1} ⊆ C× . In the
notation of Corollary 1.3 in the case where K ⊆ C, let ζ ∈ AutX(K) (Y (K))
that satisﬁes the following property: for each f ∈ K(Y )× , there exist
ωf ∈ Fn(Y (K), S1 ),

qf ∈ K(Y )×

such that f ζ = ωf · qf . Then
ζ ∈ Gal(Y /X).
Indeed, write μ for the Lebesgue measure on C; μY for the measure on
Y (C) induced by a [nowhere-vanishing] volume form on the Riemann surface associated to Y ×K C; n for the degree of the covering Y → X;
ζ1 , . . . , ζn for the n distinct elements of Gal(Y /X). For each j = 1, . . . , n,
write
def
Ej = {y ∈ Y (K) | y ζζj = y} ⊆ Y (C);
Fj ⊆ Y (C)
for the closure of Ej ⊆ Y (C) in the complex topology [i.e., the topology
induced by the topology of the topological ﬁeld C]. Thus, Ej ⊆ Y (C)
is measurable [i.e., with respect to the measure μY ]. Note that, since
ζ ∈ AutX(K) (Y (K)),

Ej = Y (K).
1≤j≤n

Since the subset Y (K) ⊆ Y (C) is easily veriﬁed to be dense in the complex
topology, it follows immediately that

Fj = Y (C).

Thus, we conclude that
0 < μY (Y (C)) ≤



μY (Fj ) < ∞.

1≤j≤n

In particular, there exists an element j ∈ {1, . . . , n} such that μY (Fj ) > 0.
Fix such an element j. Next, for each f ∈ K(Y )× , it follows immediately
that

μY (Fj∗ ) > 0, where Fj∗ denotes the closure of Ej∗ ⊆ Y (C) in the complex
topology. Thus, we conclude that, for y ∈ Fj∗ (⊆ Y (C)),
ζ

ζ

|(f · (qfj )−1 )(y)| = 1 (⇐⇒ (f · (qfj )−1 )(y) ∈ S1 ).

In particular, since μ(S1 ) = 0 and μY (Fj∗ ) > 0, the meromorphicity of
ζ

[the function Y (C) → C ∪ {∞} determined by] f · (qfj )−1 implies that
ζ

f · (qfj )−1 is in fact a constant function. Thus, we conclude as in the ﬁnal
portion of the proof of Corollary 1.3 that ζ ∈ Gal(Y /X).
(ii) Finally, we observe that Corollary 1.3 in the case where

follows immediately [since μ(Qab ) ⊆ S1 ] from the fact veriﬁed in Remark
1.3.1, (i).

Preliminaries on combinatorial anabelian geometry

In this section, we give some preliminaries on combinatorial anabelian geometry which will be of use in the theory developed in the present paper.
Theorem 2.1 (Outer automorphisms of conﬁguration space groups
induced by open immersions). Let n be an integer such that n ≥ 2; k an
algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic 0; X a hyperbolic curve over k of type
(g, rX ); U an open subscheme of X which is a hyperbolic curve over k of type
(g, rU ), where rU > rX [which implies that (g, rU ) ∈
/ {(0, 3), (1, 1)}; rU > 0].
Write Sn for the symmetric group on n letters; Xn (respectively, Un ) for the
n-th conﬁguration space associated to X (respectively, U ). Let
α ∈ Out(ΠUn ).
Recall that there exists a unique permutation σ ∈ Sn ⊆ Out(ΠUn ) of the factors
of Un [cf. [CbTpII], Theorem B] such that
• α ◦ σ ∈ OutF (ΠUn ) [cf. [CbTpII], Theorem B, (i)];
• the outer automorphism α1 ∈ Out(ΠU ) induced by α◦σ [which does not depend on the choice of projection morphisms of co-length 1 — cf. [CbTpI],
Theorem A, (i)] preserves the set of cuspidal inertia subgroups of ΠU [cf.
[CbTpI], Theorem A, (ii)].
Suppose that
(a) if n = 2, then either rX > 0 or α ◦ σ ∈ OutFC (ΠUn ) [cf. [CmbCsp],
Deﬁnition 1.1, (ii)];
18

(b) α1 stabilizes the set of conjugacy classes of cuspidal inertia subgroups of
ΠU associated to the cusps of U that arise from the cusps of X;
Then α determines an outer automorphism of ΠXn via the natural outer surjection ΠUn  ΠXn induced by the natural open immersion Un → Xn .
Proof. First, since Sn acts compatibly on Un and Xn , by replacing α ◦ σ by α,
we may assume without loss of generality that
α ∈ OutF (ΠUn ).
Next, observe that it follows immediately from condition (b) that, by replacing
α by the composite of α with a suitable element ∈ OutFC (ΠUn ) that
• arises, via various specialization and generization isomorphisms, from [log]
scheme theory, and, moreover,
• determines an outer automorphism of ΠXn via the natural outer surjection
ΠU n  Π X n
[cf. the proof of [CmbCsp], Lemma 2.4], we may also assume without loss of
generality that
(c) α1 induces the identity automorphism on the set of conjugacy classes of
cuspidal inertia subgroups of ΠU .
Let V  U be an open subscheme which is a hyperbolic curve over k of type
(g, rU + 1); α̃ ∈ AutF (ΠUn ) a lifting of α ∈ OutF (ΠUn ). Write
def

{x} = U \ V,

def

Xx = X \ {x} ⊆ X.

Then, for suitable choices of basepoints, we obtain a commutative diagram of
homomorphisms of proﬁnite groups

where Vn−1 (respectively, (Xx )n−1 ) denotes the (n − 1)-th conﬁguration space
of V (respectively, Xx ); the horizontal sequences denote the homotopy exact
sequences induced by the ﬁrst projections Un → U and Xn → X; the vertical
arrows denote the homomorphisms induced by the natural open immersions
Vn−1 → (Xx )n−1 , Un → Xn , and U → X [cf. [MT], Proposition 2.2, (i)].
Next, we verify the following assertion:
Claim 2.1.A: Suppose that n = 2. Then the automorphism α̃|ΠV ∈
Aut(ΠV ) [induced by α̃ ∈ AutF (ΠUn ) via the injection ΠV → ΠU2 in
the above commutative diagram] preserves and ﬁxes the conjugacy
classes of cuspidal inertia subgroups of ΠV that are not associated
to x.
19

In the case where α ∈ OutFC (ΠUn ), it follows immediately from condition (c)
that α̃|ΠV preserves and ﬁxes the conjugacy classes of cuspidal inertia subgroups
of ΠV [cf. [CmbCsp], Proposition 1.2, (iii); [CbTpII], Lemma 3.2, (iv)]. Thus,
by condition (a), we may assume without loss of generality that rX > 0. Then
it follows from our assumption that rU > rX that rU ≥ 2. Write
• Cusp(U ) for the set of cusps of U ;
• ρU : ΠU → Out(ΠV ) for the outer representation determined by the exact
sequence in the above commutative diagram
1 −→ ΠV −→ ΠU2 −→ ΠU −→ 1;
• Y log for the [uniquely determined, up to unique isomorphism] smooth log
curve over Spec k such that UY = U ;
• Y2log for the second log conﬁguration space associated to Y log ;
def

• for each y ∈ Cusp(U ), y log = y ×Y Y log [where the ﬁber product is
determined by the natural morphism Y log → Y obtained by forgetting
the log structure];
def

• Yylog = Y2log ×Y log y log [where the ﬁber product is determined by the ﬁrst
projection Y2log → Y log and the natural projection y log → Y log ];
• Gy for the semi-graph of anabelioids of pro-Primes PSC-type determined
by the stable log curve Yylog over y log [cf. [CmbGC], Deﬁnition 1.1, (i)];
• vynew (respectively, vy ) for the vertex of Gy associated to the irreducible
component that contains (respectively, does not contain) the cusp that
arises from the diagonal divisor of Y2log ;
• ΠGy for the pro-Primes fundamental group of Gy [cf. [CmbGC], Deﬁnition
1.1, (ii)].
Thus, for each y ∈ Cusp(U ), we have a natural Im(ρU ) (⊆ Out(ΠV ))-torsor
of outer isomorphisms
∼
ΠV → ΠGy
that induces a bijection between the respective sets of cuspidal inertia subgroups.
For each y ∈ Cusp(U ), let us ﬁx an outer isomorphism
∼

ΠV → ΠGy
that belongs to this collection. Then, by conjugating by this ﬁxed outer isomorphism, we conclude that α̃|ΠV determines an outer automorphism αy ∈
Out(ΠGy ) for each y ∈ Cusp(U ).
Let y, z ∈ Cusp(U ) such that y = z. [Recall that rU ≥ 2.] Then observe [by
varying y, z ∈ Cusp(U )] that it suﬃces to prove that αy preserves and ﬁxes the
20

conjugacy class of cuspidal inertia subgroups of ΠGy associated to z [where we
identify naturally the set of cusps of V with the set of cusps of Gy ].
Next, we recall that α1 ∈ Out(ΠU ) preserves and ﬁxes the conjugacy class
of cuspidal inertia subgroups of ΠU associated to y [cf. condition (c)]. Thus,
it follows from [CbTpII], Theorem 1.9, (ii), that, by replacing α̃ by the composite of α̃ with an inner automorphism of ΠU2 , we may assume without loss
of generality that αy preserves the set of verticial subgroups of ΠGy . Since
(g, rU ) ∈
/ {(0, 3), (1, 1)}, it follows [cf. [MT], Remark 1.2.2] that αy preserves
and ﬁxes the conjugacy classes of verticial subgroups of ΠGy . Let Πvy ⊆ ΠGy be
a verticial subgroup associated to vy ; α̃y ∈ Aut(ΠGy ) a lifting of αy such that
α̃y (Πvy ) = Πvy . On the other hand, observe that the composite
∼

Πvy ⊆ ΠGy ← ΠV → ΠU2  ΠU
— where the ﬁnal arrow denotes the natural outer surjection induced by the
∼
second projection U2 → U — determines an outer isomorphism Πvy → ΠU that
induces a bijection between the respective sets of cuspidal inertia subgroups
and is compatible with the respective outer automorphisms αy and α1 . Here,
we recall that the cusp z abuts to the vertex vy . Thus, by condition (c), we
conclude that αy preserves and ﬁxes the conjugacy class of cuspidal inertia
subgroups of ΠGy associated to z. This completes the proof of Claim 2.1.A.
In the remainder of the proof of Theorem 2.1, we proceed by induction on
n ≥ 2. Next, we verify the following assertion:
Claim 2.1.B: Suppose that n = 2. Then Theorem 2.1 holds.
Indeed, let us note that, by condition (c), α1 preserves the kernel of the natural
surjection ΠU  ΠX . On the other hand, it follows immediately from Claim
2.1.A that α̃|ΠV ∈ Aut(ΠV ) preserves the kernel of the surjection ΠV  ΠXx .
Thus, since ΠXx is center-free, we conclude that α̃ induces an automorphism of
out

ΠX2 = ΠXx  ΠX . This completes the proof of Claim 2.1.B.
Next, we verify the following assertion [by a similar argument to the argument used to prove Claim 2.1.B]:
Claim 2.1.C: Let m be an integer such that m ≥ 2. Suppose that
Theorem 2.1 holds in the case where n = m. Then Theorem 2.1
holds in the case where n = m + 1.
Indeed, let us note that, by condition (c), α1 preserves the kernel of the natural
surjection ΠU  ΠX . Moreover, since m ≥ 2, it follows from [CbTpI], Theorem
A, (ii) [cf. also condition (c); [CbTpI], Theorem A, (i); [CbTpII], Lemma 3.2,
(iv)], that the automorphism α̃|ΠVm ∈ Aut(ΠVm ) [induced by α̃ ∈ AutF (ΠUm+1 )
via the injection ΠVm → ΠUm+1 in the above commutative diagram] induces
an automorphism of ΠV that induces the identity automorphism on the set of
conjugacy classes of cuspidal inertia subgroups of ΠV . On the other hand, since
Xx is an aﬃne hyperbolic curve, it follows from the induction hypothesis that
the automorphism α̃|ΠVm ∈ Aut(ΠVm ) preserves the kernel of the surjection
21

ΠVm → Π(Xx )m . Thus, since Π(Xx )m is center-free [cf. [MT], Proposition 2.2,
out

(ii)], we conclude that α̃ induces an automorphism of ΠXm+1 = Π(Xx )m  ΠX .
This completes the proof of Claim 2.1.C, hence of Theorem 2.1.

Corollary 2.2 (Group-theoreticity of cuspidal inertia subgroups in
conﬁguration space groups of genus 0). In the notation of Theorem 2.1,
suppose that g = 0 [so rU ≥ 4]. Then
OutFC (ΠUn ) = OutF (ΠUn )
[cf. [CmbCsp], Deﬁnition 1.1, (ii)]. In particular,
Out(ΠUn ) = OutgF (ΠUn ) × Sn
= OutF (ΠUn ) × Sn
= OutFC (ΠUn ) × Sn
[cf. [HMM], Corollary B].
Proof. Write
p1,...,n−1 : ΠUn  ΠUn−1
for the surjection induced by the projection Un → Un−1 obtained by forgetting
the n-th factor. Let Z be a hyperbolic curve over k of genus 0 that arises as a
ﬁber of the projection Un−1 → Un−2 obtained by forgetting the (n−1)-th factor.
Write Z2 for the second conﬁguration space associated to Z; pZ : ΠZ2  ΠZ
for the surjection induced by the ﬁrst projection Z2 → Z. Then, for suitable
choices of basepoints, we obtain a commutative diagram of homomorphisms of
proﬁnite groups

Thus, by replacing U by Z and applying [CbTpI], Theorem A, (ii), we may
assume without loss of generality that n = 2.
Let β ∈ OutF (ΠU2 ). Write β1 ∈ Out(ΠU ) for the outer automorphism
induced by β [cf. [CbTpI], Theorem A, (i)]. Observe that, by replacing β
by the composite of β with a suitable element ∈ OutFC (ΠU2 ) [cf. [CmbCsp],
Lemma 2.4], we may also assume without loss of generality that β1 induces
the identity automorphism on the set of conjugacy classes of cuspidal inertia
subgroups of ΠU .
In the remainder of the proof, we use the notation in the proof of Claim
def
2.1.A in the proof of Theorem 2.1 in the case where (g, rX ) = (0, 3) and α = β.
Observe that it follows from Claim 2.1.A that α ∈ OutFwC (ΠU2 ) [cf. [CbTpII],
Deﬁnition 2.1, (ii)].

Suppose that y, z ∈ Cusp(U ), where y = z, arise from cusps of X. Then our
goal is to prove that the outer automorphism αy ∈ Out(ΠGy ) [which preserves
and ﬁxes the conjugacy classes of verticial subgroups of ΠGy ] preserves and ﬁxes
the conjugacy class of cuspidal inertia subgroups of ΠGy associated to x, i.e.,
the cusp associated to the diagonal divisor of Y2log . Let Πvynew ⊆ ΠGy be a
verticial subgroup associated to vynew ; α̃ynew ∈ Aut(ΠGy ) a lifting of αy such that
α̃ynew (Πvynew ) = Πvynew . Write
α̃X ∈ AutFwC (ΠX2 )
for the automorphism induced by α̃ ∈ AutFwC (ΠU2 ) and the natural surjection
φ2 : ΠU2  ΠX2 [cf. Theorem 2.1]. Write T ⊇ Xx for the tripod over k obtained
by eliminating the cusp z of Xx . Then it follows immediately from the various
deﬁnitions involved that the composite
∼

Πvynew ⊆ ΠGy ← ΠV  ΠXx  ΠT
— where ΠV  ΠXx (respectively, ΠXx  ΠT ) denotes the natural outer
surjection induced by the natural open immersion V → Xx (respectively, Xx →
∼
T ) — determines an outer isomorphism Πvynew → ΠT that induces a bijection
between the respective sets of cuspidal inertia subgroups and is compatible
with the outer automorphisms [of Πvynew , ΠT , respectively] induced by α̃ynew
and the restriction α̃X |ΠXx of α̃X to ΠXx [cf. Claim 2.1.A]. On the other
hand, since α̃X ∈ AutFwC (ΠX2 ) = AutFC (ΠX2 ) [cf. [CbTpII], Theorem A,
(ii)], it follows that α̃X preserves and ﬁxes the conjugacy classes of the cuspidal
inertia subgroups of ΠXx [cf. condition (c); [CmbCsp], Proposition 1.2, (iii);
[CbTpII], Lemma 3.2, (iv)], hence of ΠT . Thus, we conclude that α̃ynew preserves
and ﬁxes the conjugacy classes of cuspidal inertia subgroups of Πvynew , hence
that αy ∈ Out(ΠGy ) preserves and ﬁxes the conjugacy class of cuspidal inertia
subgroups of ΠGy associated to x. This completes the proof of Corollary 2.2.
Remark 2.2.1. One veriﬁes immediately that Theorem 2.1 and Corollary 2.2,
as well as their proofs, go through without change when the various “Π’s” are
replaced by their respective maximal pro-l quotients, for some prime number l.
We leave the routine details to the reader. On the other hand, in the present
paper, we shall not need these pro-l versions of Theorem 2.1 and Corollary 2.2.

Various properties of closed subgroups of the
Grothendieck-Teichmüller group

In this section, we apply the technique developed in [Tsjm], §1, i.e., combinatorial Belyi cuspidalization, to give a purely combinatorial/group-theoretic

23

deﬁnition of certain classes of closed subgroups of GT [cf. Deﬁnition 3.3]. Moreover, we prove a certain relationship between these classes [cf. Corollary 3.7] by
applying Theorem 2.1.
def
Write X = P1Q \{0, 1, ∞}; Xn for the n-th conﬁguration space associated to
X, where n ≥ 2 denotes a positive integer; GT ⊆ Out(ΠX ) for the GrothendieckTeichmüller group [cf. [CmbCsp], Deﬁnition 1.11, (i); [CmbCsp], Remark 1.11.1].
Then recall from the ﬁrst display of [HMM], Corollary C, that we have a natural
inclusion GT → Out(ΠXn ). We shall write GTn ⊆ Out(ΠXn ) for the image of
this inclusion.
Corollary 3.1 (Purely combinatorial/group-theoretic reconstruction
of the symmetric group). For each positive integer m, write Sm for the
symmetric group on m letters; Am (⊆ Sm ) for the alternating group on m
letters. Let us regard An+3 ⊆ Sn+3 as subgroups of Out(ΠXn ) via the natural
injection Sn+3 → Out(ΠXn ) induced by the natural action of Sn+3 on Xn [cf.
[HMM], Remark 2.1.1]. Let
ψn : Out(ΠXn )  Sn+3
be a representative of the outer surjection ξn induced by the natural action of
Out(ΠXn ) on the set of generalized ﬁber subgroups of length 1 [cf. [HMM],
Theorem A, (ii)]. Then the following hold:
(i) Write
F ⊆ ΠXn
for the generalized ﬁber subgroup of co-length 1 associated to the subset
{5, . . . , n + 3} ⊆ {1, . . . , n + 3} of labels of cardinality n − 1 [cf. [HMM],
Theorem A, (ii); [HMM], Deﬁnition 2.1, (ii)]. Let
α ∈ Out(ΠXn )
be an outer automorphism of ΠXn such that ψn (α) = (1 2)(3 4), and
∼
α induces the identity outer automorphism of ΠXn /F (→ ΠX ) via the
natural surjection ΠXn  ΠXn /F . Then
α = (1 2)(3 4) ∈ An+3 ⊆ Sn+3 ⊆ Out(ΠXn )
[cf. [CmbCsp], Corollary 4.2, (ii); the ﬁrst display of [HMM], Corollary
C; [HMM], Deﬁnition 2.7], and the subgroup An+3 ⊆ Out(ΠXn ) may be
reconstructed, in a purely combinatorial/group-theoretic way, from ΠXn
as the subgroup of Out(ΠXn ) generated by the Out(ΠXn )-conjugacy class
of α [which depends only on the outer surjection ξn ].
(ii) Suppose that n ≥ 3. Write

F ⊆ ΠXn

24

for the generalized ﬁber subgroup of length 2 associated to the subset {1, 2} ⊆
{1, . . . , n + 3} of labels of cardinality 2 [cf. [HMM], Theorem A, (ii);
[HMM], Deﬁnition 2.1, (ii)]. Let
α ∈ Out(ΠXn )
be an outer automorphism of ΠXn such that ψn (α) = (1 2), and α induces
∼
the identity outer automorphism of ΠXn /F (→ ΠXn−2 ) via the natural
surjection ΠXn  ΠXn /F . Then
α = (1 2) ∈ Sn+3 ⊆ Out(ΠXn )
[cf. [CmbCsp], Corollary 4.2, (ii); the ﬁrst display of [HMM], Corollary
C; [HMM], Deﬁnition 2.7], and the subgroup Sn+3 ⊆ Out(ΠXn ) may be
reconstructed, in a purely combinatorial/group-theoretic way, from ΠXn
as the subgroup of Out(ΠXn ) generated by the Out(ΠXn )-conjugacy class
of α [which depends only on the outer surjection ξn ].
Proof. Write A ⊆ Out(ΠXn ) (respectively, S ⊆ Out(ΠXn )) for the subgroup
constructed by the algorithm of assertion (i) (respectively, assertion (ii)). Then
it follows immediately from the well-known structure of Sn+3 [where we recall
that n + 3 ≥ 5] that An+3 ⊆ A (respectively, Sn+3 ⊆ S). [Here, we recall
that the kernel of the unique outer surjection S4  S3 is normally generated
by (1 2)(3 4).] On the other hand, by applying the ﬁrst display of [HMM],
Corollary C, we conclude that An+3 = A (respectively, Sn+3 = S). This
completes the proof of Corollary 3.1.
Remark 3.1.1. In [HMM], Corollary C, the subgroup Sn+3 ⊆ Out(ΠXn ) is
reconstructed by forming the local center Z loc (Out(ΠXn )) of Out(ΠXn ). This
local center is calculated by applying the Grothendieck Conjecture for hyperbolic
curves over number ﬁelds [cf. [LocAn], Theorem A; [Tama], Theorem 0.4]. On
the other hand, if n ≥ 3, then, by applying the algorithm given in Corollary
3.1, (ii), the subgroup Sn+3 ⊆ Out(ΠXn ) may be reconstructed, in a purely
combinatorial/group-theoretic way, from ΠXn without applying the Grothendieck
Conjecture for hyperbolic curves over number ﬁelds.
Deﬁnition 3.2. Let n be an integer such that n ≥ 2; k an algebraically closed
ﬁeld of characteristic 0; U a hyperbolic curve over k. Write Un for the n-th
conﬁguration space associated to U . Recall the subgroup
OutgF (ΠUn ) ⊆ Out(ΠUn )
[cf. [HMM], Deﬁnition 2.1, (iv)]. Then we shall write
OutgF (ΠUn )cusp ⊆ OutgF (ΠUn )
for the subgroup of elements that induce outer automorphisms of ΠU that preserve and ﬁx the conjugacy classes of cuspidal inertia subgroups of ΠU .

deﬁnition of “  ” that φ is uniquely determined by φΠ , † B , and B .]
(ii) We shall say that the pair (B , † B ) satisﬁes the COF-property [i.e., “coﬁltered property”] if the pair (B , † B ) satisﬁes the following condition:

27

• the cardinality of the set of geometric dominations [cf. (i)] of B by
† 
B is ≤ 1.
(iv) Write Cusp(ΠU ) (respectively, Cusp(ΠX )) for the set of cusps of ΠU (respectively, ΠX ) [cf. [Tsjm], Theorem 1.3, (i)]. Note that the horizontal arrow in B induces a natural injection Cusp(ΠX ) = {0, 1, ∞} →
Cusp(ΠU ); we shall regard Cusp(ΠX ) as a subset of Cusp(ΠU ) via this
injection. Let T ⊆ Cusp(ΠU ) \ Cusp(ΠX ). Write I(ΠU ) for the set of
cuspidal inertia subgroups of ΠU [cf. [Tsjm], Theorem 1.3, (i)]. Thus,
Cusp(ΠU ) may be identiﬁed with I(ΠU )/ΠU . Write ΠU  ΠT for the
quotient by the normal closed subgroup topologically generated by the
out

cuspidal inertia subgroups of ΠU associated to the cusps ∈ T ; ΠU  N 
out

ΠT  N for the natural quotient induced by the quotient ΠU  ΠT . For
def
Ic ∈ I(ΠU ), write Dc = N out (Ic ); DT,c for the image of Dc via the

quotient ΠU  N  ΠT  N . Then we shall say that the arithmetic
Belyi diagram B satisﬁes the CS-property [i.e.,“cuspidal separatedness
property”] if B satisﬁes the following condition:
• for Ic , Ic ∈ I(ΠU ), DT,c is commensurable to DT,c if and only if
def

there exists σ ∈ Ker(ΠU  ΠT ) such that (Ic )σ = σIc σ −1 = Ic .
out

One veriﬁes immediately that this condition implies that DT,c ⊆ ΠT  N
is commensurably terminal, hence normally terminal.
(v) We shall say that J satisﬁes the COF-property (respectively, the RGCproperty) if every pair of arithmetic Belyi diagrams satisﬁes the COFproperty (respectively, the RGC-property). We shall say that J satisﬁes
the CS-property if every arithmetic Belyi diagram satisﬁes the CS-property.
We shall say that J satisﬁes the BC-property [i.e., “Belyi compatibility
property”] if J satisﬁes the COF- and the RGC-properties. By a slight
abuse of notation, we shall use the notation BGT to denote a closed subgroup of GT that satisﬁes the BC-property.

Remark 3.3.1. Note that it follows immediately from the various deﬁnitions
involved that:
(a) each notion deﬁned in Deﬁnition 3.3, (i), (ii), (iii) (respectively, Deﬁnition
3.3, (iv)), concerning B , † B (respectively, concerning B ) is equivalent
to the corresponding notion concerning the restrictions of B , † B (respectively, the restriction of B ) to arbitrary open subgroups of N , N †
(respectively, N ) that are normal in J;
(b) each notion deﬁned in Deﬁnition 3.3, (v), concerning J is equivalent to
the corresponding notion concerning an arbitrary open subgroup of J.

28

Remark 3.3.2. Let us recall that there are precisely two situations in [Tsjm] in
which the Grothendieck Conjecture for hyperbolic curves over number ﬁelds [cf.
[LocAn], Theorem A; [Tama], Theorem 0.4] is applied, namely:
(a) Claim 1.3.A in the proof of [Tsjm], Theorem 1.3, (ii) [which is applied in
[Tsjm], Deﬁnition 1.4, to deﬁne the notion of an arithmetic Belyi diagram];
(b) the proof of [Tsjm], Theorem 1.3, (iii) [which must be applied in order
to give a purely combinatorial/group-theoretic construction of the outer
isomorphism that is used to identify the two copies of ΠX that appear in
a Belyi diagram].
On the other hand, in Remark 3.3.3 below,
we shall give a purely combinatorial/group-theoretic algorithm for
constructing, via the algorithm of Corollary 3.1, (ii), the identifying
outer isomorphism between the two copies of ΠX that appear in a
Belyi diagram.
In particular, in the context of the theory of the present paper, instead of applying [Tsjm], Theorem 1.3, (iii), one may apply the purely combinatorial/grouptheoretic algorithm of Remark 3.3.3, which does not require any use of the
Grothendieck Conjecture for hyperbolic curves over number ﬁelds [cf. Remark
3.1.1]. In addition, [Tsjm], Theorem 1.3, (ii) [i.e., the compatibility of the identifying outer isomorphism between the two copies of ΠX with the respective
outer actions on the two copies] follows immediately from the functoriality of
the purely combinatorial/group-theoretic algorithm given in Remark 3.3.3 below.
Thus, in summary, in the argument of the present paper,
one may in fact avoid any use of the Grothendieck Conjecture for hyperbolic curves over number ﬁelds when applying the theory/results
of [Tsjm] in the present paper.
Remark 3.3.3. In the following discussion, we use the notation that appears in
the statement and proof of [Tsjm], Theorem 1.3.
(i) In the remainder of the present Remark 3.3.3, we shall reconstruct the
identifying outer isomorphism between the copies of ΠX that appear in
a given Belyi diagram B [cf. Remark 3.3.2] — by means of a purely
combinatorial/group-theoretic algorithm — from [the underlying purely
combinatorial/group-theoretic structure of] the collection of data
(a) the proﬁnite group ΠX3 ;
(b) the outer surjections pri,j : ΠX3  ΠX2 , where (i, j) ∈ {(1, 2), (1, 3),
(2, 3)}, determined by the natural projection X3  X2 to the ith and j-th factors, i.e., to be precise, the normal closed subgroups
Ker(pri,j ) ⊆ ΠX3 , together with the composite outer isomorphisms

where (i, j), (i , j  ) ∈ {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)};
29

(c) the outer surjections pi : ΠX2  ΠX (i ∈ {1, 2}) determined by the
natural projection X2  X to the i-th factor, i.e., to be precise, the
normal closed subgroups Ker(p1 ), Ker(p2 ) ⊆ ΠX2 , together with the
∼

composite outer isomorphism ΠX2 /Ker(p1 ) ← ΠX → ΠX2 /Ker(p2 );
(d) the proﬁnite groups ΠX2 and ΠX , i.e., to be precise, the quotients of
ΠX3 discussed in (b) and (c);
(e) surjections
pr1 : ΠX3  ΠX ,

pr2 : ΠX3  ΠX ,

pr3 : ΠX3  ΠX ,

that represent the respective outer surjections p1 ◦ pr1,3 , p1 ◦ pr2,3 ,
p2 ◦ pr2,3 .
(f) the open subgroup ΠU ⊆ ΠX ;
(g) the subset of labeled elements {0, 1, ∞} ⊆ Cusp(ΠU ) [cf, [Tsjm], Theorem 1.3, (i)];
(h) the subset of labeled elements {0, 1, ∞} ⊆ Cusp(ΠX ) [cf, [Tsjm], Theorem 1.3, (i)]
— i.e., without applying the Grothendieck Conjecture for hyperbolic curves
over number ﬁelds. Here, the data (f), (g), (h) correspond to the given
Belyi diagram B [cf. the data “C(ΠX )” of [Tsjm], Theorem 1.3, (iii)].
Also, we note that any two collections of choices of surjections as in (e) are
related to one another by composition with a single inner automorphism
of ΠX3 . Moreover, by applying Corollary 3.1, (ii); [HMM], Theorem A,
(ii), one may regard the data of (b), (c), (d), (e) as data reconstructed
[i.e., by using the action of the symmetric group S6 ⊆ Out(ΠX3 )], up to
unique isomorphism, from the data of (a).
(ii) Next, observe that the identifying outer isomorphism between the copies
of ΠX in B coincides with the composite

where the ﬁrst and the ﬁnal arrows denote the outer isomorphisms arising from the [scheme-theoretic!] isomorphisms of tripods determined by
the data of (i), (e), (h) [which may be used to rigidify the correspondences between cusps]; the second and the third arrows denote the natural
isomorphisms induced by the natural outer surjections ΠV3  ΠU3 and
ΠU3  ΠX3 . Recall that the open subgroup ΠV3 ⊆ ΠX3 is deﬁned to be

the inverse image of the open subgroup Π×3
U ⊆ ΠX [determined by the
open subgroup ΠU ⊆ ΠX ] via the surjection ΠX3  Π×3
X determined by
the surjection pri : ΠX3  ΠX , where i = 1, 2, 3. Thus, to reconstruct the
above composite in a purely combinatorial/group-theoretic way, it suﬃces
to reconstruct the following data:
(a) the 3-central tripods ⊆ ΠX3 [i.e., such as Πctpd ];
30

(b) the kernel of the natural outer surjection ΠV3  ΠU3 [which allows us
to characterize Πctpd [cf. Claim 1.3.C in the proof of [Tsjm], Theorem
];
1.3, (ii)] and reconstruct Πctpd

and “ΠX ” as subquotients of

Π3 = ΠU3 /Ker(ΠU3  ΠX3 ) (→ ΠX3 ).
(iii) The data of (ii), (a), may be reconstructed by applying the algorithm
implicit in the proof of [CbTpII], Theorem 3.16, (v) [cf. also [HMM],
Corollary B]. Once the data of (ii), (b) (respectively, (d)), has been reconstructed, the data of (ii), (c) (respectively, (e)), may be reconstructed
by using the action of the symmetric group S6 ⊆ Out(ΠX3 ) (respectively,
S6 ⊆ Out(Π3 )) [cf. Corollary 3.1, (ii); the construction of the geometric
∼
outer isomorphism “Πvnew → Πv ” in the proof of [CbTpII], Lemma 3.13,
(iii)]. Thus, it suﬃces to reconstruct the data of (ii), (b), (d) [cf. (v), (vi),
below].
(iv) Recall the set IX3 of inertia subgroups ⊆ ΠX3 of the discussion immediately following Claim 1.3.B in the proof of [Tsjm], Theorem 1.3, (ii).
Write
F

3
for the subset consisting of inertia subgroups ⊆ Ker(pri,j ) for some (i, j) ∈
{(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)}. Let (i, j) ∈ {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)}. Recall from [HMM],
Theorem A, (ii); the ﬁrst display of [HMM], Corollary C, that
(a) the image GT3 ⊆ Out(ΠX3 )
of the natural inclusion GT → Out(ΠX3 ) may be reconstructed from the
data of (i), (a). Next, observe that the natural outer action of GT3 =
OutgF (ΠX3 ) on ΠX3 stabilizes Ker(pri,j ) ⊆ ΠX3 , hence determines
out

(b) an outer representation ΠX3  GT3 → Out(Ker(pri,j )),
which is l-cyclotomically full [cf. [CmbGC], Deﬁnition 2.3, (ii)] for any
prime number l. In particular, by applying the algorithm implicit in the
proof of [CmbGC], Corollary 2.7, (i), we conclude that the cuspidal inertia
subgroups of Ker(pri,j ) may be reconstructed group-theoretically from the
data of (b). Thus, by varying (i, j) ∈ {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)}, we conclude
that

Proposition 3.4 (Functoriality of cuspidal inertia subgroups via geometric dominations). In the situation of Deﬁnition 3.3, (i), every conjugacy
class of cuspidal inertia subgroups of ΠU arises as the image via φ of a unique
conjugacy class of cuspidal inertia subgroups of ΠU † .
Proof. We regard U, U † as open subschemes of X via the respective natural open
immersions U → X, U † → X. Write Cusp(U † ) for the set of cusps of U † ; S ⊆
Cusp(U † ) for the subset of cusps s ∈ Cusp(U † ) such that some [or equivalently,
every] cuspidal inertia subgroup of ΠU † associated to s is contained in Ker(φ);
U † ⊆ US† (⊆ X) for the partial compactiﬁcation of U † such that U † = US† \ S.
Thus, the natural outer surjection ΠU †  ΠU † induces a bijection between the
S
set of conjugacy classes of cuspidal inertia subgroups of ΠU † associated to cusps
∈ Cusp(U † ) \ S and the set of conjugacy classes of cuspidal inertia subgroups
of ΠU † . Next, observe that it follows immediately from Deﬁnition 3.3, (i), (a),
S
(b), that φ induces an outer isomorphism
∼

φS : ΠU † → ΠU
S

such that
(i) φS maps every cuspidal inertia subgroup of ΠU † to a cuspidal inertia
S
subgroup of ΠU ;
(ii) φS maps every cuspidal inertia subgroup of ΠU † associated to 0, 1, ∞ to
S
a cuspidal inertia subgroup of ΠU associated to 0, 1, ∞, respectively.
34

Thus, to complete the proof of Proposition 3.4, it suﬃces to verify that φS
induces [cf. (i)] a bijection between the set of conjugacy classes of cuspidal inertia
subgroups of ΠU † and the set of conjugacy classes of cuspidal inertia subgroups
S
of ΠU . To this end, let us ﬁrst observe that injectivity follows immediately
from the fact that φS is an outer isomorphism. On the other hand, surjectivity
follows immediately, in light of (ii), from the fact that [since the hyperbolic
curves U † and U are of genus 0] ΠU † and ΠU are topologically generated by
S
their respective collections of cuspidal inertia subgroups associated to cusps
= ∞. This completes the proof of Proposition 3.4.
Proposition 3.5 (Natural action of GT on the set of geometric dominations). In the notation of Deﬁnition 3.3, (i), one may construct a natural
action of CGT (J) (⊆ Out(ΠX )) on the set of geometric dominations between
arbitrary arithmetic Belyi diagrams.
Proof. Let us consider the data of Remark 3.3.3, (i), (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f),

follows immediately from the various deﬁnitions involved.

hV,W

ZOutgF (ΠV2 )cusp (NV2 ) ⊆ OutgF (ΠV2 )cusp → OutgF (ΠW2 )cusp
is injective.
def

Proof. Write h = hV,W ; Cusp(V ), Cusp(W ) for the set of cusps of V , W , respectively. First, let us note that we may assume without loss of generality [i.e.,
by forming the composite of the hV,W for suitable V , W ] that the cardinality
of the set Cusp(V ) \ Cusp(W ) is 1. Let
β ∈ ZOutgF (ΠV2 )cusp (NV2 ) (⊆ OutgF (ΠV2 )cusp )
be such that h(β) = 1. Then it suﬃces to verify that
β = 1.
Note that the natural composites

determine natural outer actions of N on ΠV2 , ΠW2 , hence also on ΠV , ΠW [by
applying the natural outer surjections ΠV2 → ΠV , ΠW2 → ΠW determined by
the respective ﬁrst projections].
Next, let us write
• y for the unique element ∈ Cusp(V ) \ Cusp(W );
• ηj : OutgF (ΠV2 ) → OutgF (ΠV ) for the natural homomorphism induced by
the j-th projection, where j ∈ {1, 2} [where we note that in fact, η1 = η2

• Yylog = Y2log ×Y log y log [where the ﬁber product is determined by the ﬁrst

• Gy for the semi-graph of anabelioids of pro-Primes PSC-type determined

respectively;
• vy for the vertex of Gy associated to the irreducible component that does
not contain cΔ ;

Since β ∈ ZOutgF (ΠV2 ) (NV2 ) (⊆ OutgF (ΠV2 )), and ΠV2 is center-free [cf.
[MT], Proposition 2.2, (ii)], β determines a ΠV2 -outer automorphism γV of

out

suitable composite with an inner automorphism of ΠV2  N [determined by an
element of ΠV2 ], we may assume without loss of generality that
(γV )1 (Iy ) = Iy .
37

Let Πvy ⊆ ΠGy be a verticial subgroup associated to vy . Note that since V  W ,
vy is not of type (0, 3). Thus, it follows immediately from [CbTpII], Theorem 1.9,
(ii), that the restriction γV |ΠGy of γV to ΠGy preserves and ﬁxes the conjugacy
class of Πvy . Moreover, by replacing γV by a suitable composite with an inner

automorphism of ΠV2  N [determined by an element of ΠGy ] if necessary, we

out

by γV [cf. Theorem 2.1] via the surjection ΠV2  N  ΠW2  N in the above

Next, we verify the following assertion:
Claim 3.6.A: The outer automorphism γ ∈ Out(ΠV ) determined by
out

the restriction γW |ΠV of γW to ΠV (→ ΠW2  N ) coincides with
η2 (β) ∈ Out(ΠV ).
Recall that γV |ΠGy preserves the cuspidal inertia subgroups of ΠGy [cf. Corollary 2.2]. Write qΔ : ΠGy  ΠV for the natural outer surjection induced by the
second projection V2 → V . Note that Ker(qΔ ) coincides with the normal closed
subgroup topologically generated by the cuspidal inertia subgroups of ΠGy associated to cΔ . On the other hand, it follows immediately from the various
deﬁnitions involved that
• γ (respectively, η2 (β)) coincides with the outer automorphism induced by
γV |ΠGy via the surjection qy (respectively, qΔ );
∼

• qy and qΔ determine the same outer isomorphism (ΠGy ⊇) Πvy → ΠV .
Thus, since γV |ΠGy (Πvy ) = Πvy , we obtain the desired conclusion. This completes the proof of Claim 3.6.A.
Next, since h(β) = 1, we have

γW ∈ Inn(ΠW2  N ) ⊆ Aut(ΠW2  N ),

Dy . Recall that since B satisﬁes the CS-property, Dy is normally terminal in
out

ΠW  N [cf. the ﬁnal sentence of Deﬁnition 3.3, (iv)]. Thus, we conclude that
out

the inner automorphism (γW )1 ∈ Inn(ΠW  N ) is determined by a(n) [unique]
element ∈ Dy ∩ ΠW = {1}, hence, in particular, that the inner automorphism
γW is determined by an element ∈ ΠV ⊆ ΠW2 , i.e., that γ = 1. Finally, it follows
immediately from the injectivity of η2 [cf. Corollary 2.2; [CmbCsp], Theorem
A, (i)], together with Claim 3.6.A, that β = 1. This completes the proof of
Theorem 3.6.

Corollary 3.7 (The CS-property implies the RGC-property). Let J ⊆

Proof. In the notation of Deﬁnition 3.3, (i), let φ, φ be arithmetic dominations

to prove that φ = φ . Since Ker(φ) and Ker(φ ) are topologically generated by
[certain of the] cuspidal inertia subgroups of ΠU † [cf. Deﬁnition 3.3, (i), (a)], it
follows immediately from the CS-property [where we take the “T ” of Deﬁnition
3.3, (iv), to be “Cusp(ΠU ) \ Cusp(ΠX )”], together with Deﬁnition 3.3, (i), (b),
that
Ker(φ) = Ker(φ ).

Claim 3.7.A: φ2 and φ2 map the inertia subgroups of ΠU † associ2

ated to the diagonal divisor of U2† to the inertia subgroups of ΠU2
associated to the diagonal divisor of U2 .
Indeed, Claim 3.7.A follows immediately from Deﬁnition 3.3, (i), (a).
Next, we verify the following assertion:
Claim 3.7.B: Ker(φ2 ) = Ker(φ2 ).
Write

out

out

φ∗ : ΠU †  M  ΠU  M,

φ∗ : ΠU †  M  ΠU  M

for the ΠU -outer surjections determined by φ2 , φ2 , respectively, via the outer

tions. Then it follows immediately from Claim 3.7.A, together with a similar
argument to the argument applied in the proof of [CmbCsp], Proposition 1.2,
(iii), that the following assertion holds:
39

Claim 3.7.C: φ = φ∗ , φ = φ∗ . In particular, Ker(φ∗ ) = Ker(φ) =
Ker(φ ) = Ker(φ∗ ).
Thus, since Ker(φ2 ) and Ker(φ2 ) are topologically generated by [certain of the]
cuspidal inertia subgroups of ﬁber subgroups of ΠU † of length 1 [cf. Deﬁnition

3.3, (i), (a)], we conclude, again from Claim 3.7.A [cf. also [CbTpII], Lemma

It follows immediately from Claim 3.7.B that there exists a unique ΠU2 -outer

φ2 = φ2 , φ = φ . This completes the proof of Corollary 3.7.

Combinatorial construction of the ﬁeld QBGT

In §3, we deﬁned a certain class of closed subgroups BGT of GT [cf. Definition 3.3, (v)]. In this section, for each such closed subgroup BGT, we give
a purely combinatorial/group-theoretic construction of a ﬁeld QBGT associated

by domination, i.e., the existence of an arithmetic domination [cf. Deﬁnition
40

3.3, (i); Proposition 3.4; Claim 3.7.C in the proof of Corollary 3.7]. It follows
immediately from Remarks 3.3.2, 3.3.3; Proposition 3.5; [Tsjm], Deﬁnition 1.4,
that there is a natural action of CGT (BGT) on the preordered set IBGT . Since
BGT satisﬁes the COF-property [cf. Deﬁnition 3.3, (ii)], it follows formally that
the preordered set IBGT is directed, i.e., any pair of elements of the set admits
a(n) [not necessarily minimal!] upper bound. Since BGT also satisﬁes the RGCproperty [cf. Deﬁnition 3.3, (iii)], if ‡ B ∈ IBGT dominates † B ∈ IBGT , then

Remark 4.1.1. In the notation of Deﬁnition 4.1, it follows immediately from the

Proposition 4.2 (Countability of IBGT ). In the notation of Deﬁnition 4.1,
IBGT is countable.
Proof. Let us observe that since ΠX is topologically ﬁnitely generated,
• the set of open subgroups of ΠX is countable;
• there exists a countable open basis of BGT ⊆ Out(ΠX ).
Thus, since Cusp(B ) is ﬁnite, it follows from the various deﬁnitions involved
that IBGT is countable. This completes the proof of Proposition 4.2.

to show that xσ does not depend on the choice of B . But this follows formally from the COF-property of BGT, together with Proposition 3.5 and the
construction of xσ . To verify that the resulting action is continuous, it suﬃces
to observe that there exists an open subgroup H ⊆ CGT (BGT) [which may be
obtained, for instance, by forming the intersection of CGT (BGT) with the open

satisfying the desired property. This completes the proof of the above observation.
Next, let us ﬁx an element B ∈ IBGT . Then by applying the above observation in a recursive fashion [i.e., by applying the observation to B and some
ﬁnite subset F to obtain † B , then applying the observation to † B and some
other ﬁnite subset † F to obtain ‡ B , etc.], we conclude [cf. the deﬁnition of
QBGT ] that one may construct a family of injections
φB ,F : F ∪ {0, 1} → QBGT



{F ⊆Q }



[indexed by the ﬁnite subsets F ⊆ Q ] such that the following conditions are
satisﬁed:

• Cusp(B ) ⊆
Im(φB ,F ).
F ⊆Q





• If F1 ⊆ F2 ⊆ Q , then (φB ,F2 )|F1 = φB ,F1 .


Thus, the various injections φB ,F , indexed by the ﬁnite subsets F ⊆ Q , determine an injection
φB : Q → QBGT
46

associated to B ∈ IBGT such that Cusp(B ) \ {∞} ⊆ Im(φB ). In particular,
if we allow B ∈ IBGT to vary, then we obtain an equality of sets as follows:

Im(φB ) = QBGT .
B ∈IBGT

In fact, the following stronger property holds:
Claim 4.4.B: For each ﬁnite subset FBGT ⊆ QBGT , there exists an
arithmetic Belyi diagram B such that FBGT ⊆ Im(φB ).
Indeed, Claim 4.4.B follows formally from the COF-property of BGT, together

with the inclusion Cusp(B ) \ {∞} ⊆ Im(φ
B ), for B ∈ IBGT .
Next, we verify the following assertion:
Claim 4.4.C: Fix an arithmetic Belyi diagram B . Then BGT preserves Im(φB ) and induces the usual operation of multiplication on
Q.
×

Indeed, recall that {t−1 } and {t/x} (x ∈ QBGT ) are deﬁned by using the scheme−1
theoretic morphisms ιt , ιt/x . Thus, Claim 4.4.C follows immediately from the
deﬁnition of the multiplication map BGT .
Next, we verify the following assertion:
Claim 4.4.D:
(i) For any B ∈ IBGT , the maps {t−1 } and BGT determine an
×
abelian group structure on QBGT with respect to which φB
induces a group homomorphism
×

×

Q → QBGT .
(ii) φB (−1) = −1BGT .
−1

(iii) For any B ∈ IBGT ,
def

φB (−1) ∈ μ2 (QBGT ) = {x ∈ QBGT | BGT (x, x) = 1}.
(iv) μ2 (QBGT ) = {1, −1BGT }.
Since each axiom for an abelian group may be written as a condition concerning
ﬁnitely many elements of the set under consideration, we conclude, by applying
Claim 4.4.C for suitable B ∈ IBGT [i.e., B such that the subset Im(φB ) ⊆
QBGT is suﬃciently large — cf. Claim 4.4.B], that {t−1 } and BGT determine
×
an abelian group structure on QBGT . Thus, Claim 4.4.D, (i), follows from
Claims 4.4.B, 4.4.C. Claim 4.4.D, (ii), follows immediately from the deﬁnitions
of B
−1 and −1BGT . Claim 4.4.D, (iii), follows immediately from Claim 4.4.D,
(i), together with the equality (−1)2 = 1 ∈ Q. Next, we verify Claim 4.4.D,
(iv). The inclusion μ2 (QBGT ) ⊇ {1, −1BGT } follows immediately from Claim
47

4.4.D, (ii), (iii). Let x ∈ μ2 (QBGT ) \ {1}. Then Claim 4.4.B implies that there
exists an arithmetic Belyi diagram B such that −1BGT , x ∈ Im(φB ). Thus,
by applying Claim 4.4.D, (i), (iii), we conclude that −1BGT = x. This completes
the proof of Claim 4.4.D.
Next, we verify the following assertion:
Claim 4.4.E: Fix an arithmetic Belyi diagram B . Then BGT preserves Im(φB ) and induces the usual operation of addition on Q.
Indeed, recall that {t−1 }, {1 − t} are deﬁned by using the scheme-theoretic
−1
morphisms ιt , ι1−t . Moreover, we observe that BGT is completely determined
by {t−1 }, {1 − t}, BGT , and −1BGT . Thus, Claim 4.4.E follows immediately
from Claims 4.4.C; 4.4.D, (iv).
Since each axiom for a ﬁeld may be written as a condition concerning ﬁnitely
many elements of the set under consideration, we conclude, by applying Claims
4.4.C, 4.4.E, for suitable B ∈ IBGT [i.e., B such that the subset Im(φB ) ⊆
QBGT is suﬃciently large — cf. Claim 4.4.B], that BGT and BGT determine
a ﬁeld structure on QBGT such that φB is a ﬁeld homomorphism for each
B ∈ IBGT . Moreover, since B ∈IBGT Im(φB ) = QBGT , every element of
QBGT is algebraic over Q. Thus, we also conclude that
Claim 4.4.F: φB is, in fact, a ﬁeld isomorphism for every B ∈ IBGT .
This completes the proof of Claim 4.4.A.
Next, we prove that the natural action of CGT (BGT) on the set QBGT
[cf. Proposition 4.3] is compatible with the ﬁeld structure constructed above.
Let σ ∈ CGT (BGT). Recall that the maps BGT and BGT are completely
×
determined by {t−1 }, {1 − t}, {t/x} (x ∈ QBGT ), and −1BGT . Thus, since
σ

0 = 0 and 1 = 1, it suﬃces to prove the following assertion:

Claim 4.4.G: Let x ∈ QBGT , y ∈ QBGT . Then

• {1 − t}(y σ ) = ({1 − t}(y))σ ,
• {t/xσ }(y σ ) = ({t/x}(y))σ .
In particular, (−1BGT )σ = −1BGT [cf. Claim 4.4.D, (iv)].

Remark 4.4.1. Let p be a prime number, F a ﬁeld which is a ﬁnite extension
of the ﬁeld of rational numbers Q or the ﬁeld of p-adic numbers Qp . Thus, we
have a natural inclusion Q ⊆ F . Let F be an algebraic closure of F . By abuse
of notation, we shall identify Q with the algebraic closure of Q in F . Write
def
GF = Gal(F /F ). Thus, we obtain natural injections
GF → GQ → GT ⊆ Out(ΠX )
[cf. the discussion of the beginning of [Tsjm], Introduction], which we use
to identify GF with its image in GT. Then it follows immediately from the
fact that F is Kummer-faithful [cf. [AbsTopIII], Deﬁnition 1.5; [AbsTopIII],
Remark 1.5.4, (i)], together with a similar argument to the argument applied
in the proof of [Tsjm], Corollary 3.2, that GF satisﬁes the CS-property. Thus,
we conclude from Corollary 3.7 that GF satisﬁes the RGC-property. Since,
in this situation, the COF-property is immediate, we thus conclude that GF
satisﬁes the BC-property, i.e., that we may take “BGT” to be GF . Moreover,
the scheme-theoretic interpretation of the various arithmetic Belyi diagrams that
∼
appear determines a natural isomorphism of ﬁelds QGF → Q that is compatible,
relative to the natural injection GF → GQ , with the respective natural actions,
i.e., we obtain a diagram as follows:

Remark 4.4.2. It is not clear to the authors at the time of writing whether or
not GT satisﬁes the BC-property, i.e., whether or not “GT = BGT”.

that n ≥ 2. Write Xn for the n-th conﬁguration space of X = P1Q \{0, 1, ∞};
def

GTn = OutgF (ΠXn ) ⊆ Out(ΠXn ). Recall that we have a natural isomorphism
∼
GTn → GT [cf. the ﬁrst display of [HMM], Corollary C]. Then one may reconstruct from ΠXn , in a purely combinatorial/group-theoretic way, i.e., in a way
that only involves the structure of ΠXn as a topological group [cf. also Remark
4.5.1 below],
• the subgroups GTn ⊆ Out(ΠXn ), GT ⊆ Out(ΠX ), where we regard ΠX as
the quotient of ΠXn by a generalized ﬁber subgroup;

• the natural isomorphism GTn → GT;
• the collection of closed subgroups J ⊆ GTn such that J satisﬁes [i.e., the
image of J, via the natural isomorphism, in GT satisﬁes] the BC-property
[cf. Deﬁnition 3.3, (v)].

50

If, moreover, a closed subgroup J = BGT ⊆ GT ⊆ Out(ΠX ) satisﬁes the BCproperty, then the construction from ΠXn [cf. also Remark 4.5.1 below] of
• the preordered set of arithmetic Belyi diagrams IBGT [cf. Deﬁnition 4.1],
• the natural action of CGT (BGT) on the preordered set IBGT [cf. Deﬁnition
4.1],
• the set Cusp(−) associated to any element of IBGT [cf. Deﬁnition 4.1],
• the direct limit QBGT [cf. Deﬁnition 4.1],
• the natural continuous action of CGT (BGT) on QBGT [cf. Proposition
4.3], and
• the ﬁeld structure on QBGT [cf. Theorem 4.4]
may be phrased in purely combinatorial/group-theoretic terms, i.e., in terms that
only involve the structure of ΠXn as a topological group.
Proof. The various assertions of Corollary 4.5 follow immediately from Deﬁnitions 3.3, 4.1; Remarks 3.3.2, 3.3.3 [cf. also Remark 4.5.1 below]; Proposition
4.3 [and its proof]; Theorem 4.4 [and its proof]; [HMM], Theorem A, (ii); the
ﬁrst display of [HMM], Corollary C; [Tsjm], Theorem 1.3, (i); [Tsjm], Deﬁnition
1.4.

Remark 4.5.1.
(i) Here, in the context of Remark 3.3.3, (i), we observe that the natural
∼
isomorphism GTn → GT [cf. the ﬁrst display of [HMM], Corollary C],
together with the algorithm of Corollary 3.1, (ii), implies that there is in
fact no substantive diﬀerence between
• constructions starting from ΠXn [where we recall that n ≥ 2] and
• constructions starting from ΠX3 .
(ii) In the situation discussed in (i) [cf. also Remark 3.3.3, (i)], suppose that
we apply the constructions discussed in Corollary 4.5 to ΠX3 , regarded as
an abstract topological group. Then the algorithm of Corollary 3.1, (ii),
determines a subgroup
S3 ⊆ Out(ΠX ),
[i.e., where, by a slight abuse of notation, we use the notation “S3 ” to
denote this subgroup which is isomorphic to the symmetric group on 3
letters] of the group of outer automorphisms Out(ΠX ) of the quotient ΠX
of the given abstract topological group ΠX3 discussed in Remark 3.3.3,
(i), (d).

51

(iii) We maintain the notation of (ii). Then observe that since the quotient ΠX
of the given abstract topological group ΠX3 is not equipped with a natural
bijection between its set of cusps and the set of symbols {0, 1, ∞}, it follows
that this quotient ΠX is only related to any of the “ΠX ’s” that appear in
the arithmetic Belyi diagrams discussed in the statement of Corollary 4.5
[not by a single outer isomorphism, but rather] by an S3 -torsor of outer
isomorphisms.

the absolute Galois group of Q as the set of maximal closed subgroups BGT of
GT satisfying a certain purely combinatorial/group-theoretic condition that we
refer to as the AA-property [cf. Deﬁnition 5.12; Theorem 5.17, (ii)].
Write ΠX0∞ for the quotient of ΠX by the normal closed subgroup topologically generated by the cuspidal inertia subgroups associated to the cusp “1” [so
ΠX0∞ is isomorphic to Z as an abstract topological group]. Let J be a closed
subgroup of GT ⊆ Out(ΠX ). Then we shall write [by a slight abuse of notation]

ΠB  ,

B ∈IBGT

where the transition morphisms are the unique geometric dominations
Π‡ B   Π † B  .
Here, we observe that even though these transition morphisms are, strictly
speaking, outer homomorphisms, it follows immediately from the fact that,
for each B ∈ IBGT , ΠB is a proﬁnite group [cf. also Proposition 4.2], that
one may choose a coherent system of homomorphism representatives of the
given system of outer homomorphisms; in particular, Π is well-deﬁned as
52

a proﬁnite group, up to inner automorphisms. It follows immediately from
Proposition 3.5, together with the various deﬁnitions involved, that the
natural action of CGT (BGT) on IBGT [cf. Deﬁnition 4.1] induces a natural
outer action of CGT (BGT) on the group Π.
(ii) In the context of the inverse limit of Deﬁnition 5.1, (i), we shall refer to
an inverse limit of cuspidal inertia subgroups of some coﬁnal collection
of ΠB ’s [where the induced transition morphisms are necessarily isomorphisms] as a cuspidal inertia subgroup of Π. For each open subgroup Π∗ of
Π, we shall refer to the intersection of Π∗ with a cuspidal inertia subgroup
of Π as a cuspidal inertia subgroup of Π∗ and write
Cusp(Π∗ )
for the set of Π∗ -conjugacy classes of cuspidal inertia subgroups of Π∗ .
Thus, it follows immediately from the deﬁnitions that we obtain a natural
surjection
Cusp(Π∗ )  Cusp(Π)
with ﬁnite ﬁbers. For each ﬁnite subset E ∗ ⊆ Cusp(Π∗ ), write
Π∗  Π∗E ∗
for the topologically ﬁnitely generated [cf. Remark 5.1.1 below] quotient
proﬁnite group of Π∗ obtained by forming the quotient of Π∗ by the normal closed subgroup topologically generated by the cuspidal inertia subgroups associated to Cusp(Π∗ )\E ∗ . Observe that the natural outer action
of CGT (BGT) on Π [cf. Deﬁnition 5.1, (i)] induces a natural action of
CGT (BGT) on Cusp(Π). Finally, we observe that it follows immediately
from the various deﬁnitions involved [cf., especially, Deﬁnition 4.1] that
we have a natural CGT (BGT)-equivariant bijection
∼

Cusp(Π) → QBGT ∪ {∞}.
(iii) Write
CBGT
for the set of ﬁnite subsets of Cusp(Π) that contain {0, 1, ∞}. Observe
that the natural action of CGT (BGT) on Cusp(Π) [cf. Deﬁnition 5.1, (ii)]
induces a natural action of CGT (BGT) on CBGT . We shall write
st
⊆ CBGT
CBGT

for the subset of CGT (BGT)-stable elements, i.e., elements ﬁxed by the
action of CGT (BGT). Finally, we observe that the assignment IBGT 
B → Cusp(B ) ∈ CBGT induces a natural CGT (BGT)-equivariant map
IBGT → CBGT .

53

Remark 5.1.1. In the notation of Deﬁnition 5.1, it follows immediately from
Remark 4.1.1 that the kernel of the natural outer surjection
Π  ΠB 
is the normal closed subgroup of Π topologically generated by the cuspidal
inertia subgroups associated to Cusp(Π) \ Cusp(B ). In particular, the quotient
Π  ΠB may be naturally identiﬁed with the quotient
Π  ΠCusp(B )
of the third display of Deﬁnition 5.1, (ii) [i.e., where we take “Π∗ ” to be Π and
“E ∗ ” to be Cusp(B )].
st
[cf. Deﬁnition 5.1, (iii)]. Then it follows imRemark 5.1.2. Let E ∈ CBGT
mediately from the various deﬁnitions involved that the natural outer action of
CGT (BGT) on Π [cf. Deﬁnition 5.1, (i)] induces, via the natural outer surjection
Π  ΠE , a natural continuous outer action of CGT (BGT) on the topologically
ﬁnitely generated proﬁnite group ΠE [cf. the discussion entitled “Topological
groups” in Notations and Conventions; Deﬁnition 5.1, (ii); [Tsjm], Lemma 1.2,
(b); [Tsjm], Theorem 1.3, (ii); [Tsjm], Deﬁnition 1.4].

Remark 5.1.3. Observe that it follows immediately from the continuity [cf.
∼
Proposition 4.3] of the natural action of CGT (BGT) on QBGT ∪{∞} (→ Cusp(Π))
[cf. Deﬁnition 5.1, (ii)], together with the COF-property of BGT, that
st
for any E ∈ CBGT , there exists an element E st ∈ CBGT
(respectively,

st
B ∈ IBGT ) such that E ⊆ E (respectively, E ⊆ Cusp(B )).

Proposition 5.2 (Basic properties of Π). In the notation of Deﬁnition 5.1,
the following hold:
(i) There exists an isomorphism of proﬁnite groups between Π and the absolute
Galois group of the function ﬁeld of X that induces a bijection between the
respective sets of cuspidal inertia subgroups.
54

(ii) For each E ∈ CBGT , ΠE is slim. In particular, Π is slim.
out

(iii) The group Π  BGT admits a natural structure of proﬁnite group.
(iv) Let Π∗ be a normal open subgroup of Π. Then, for any suﬃciently small
normal open subgroup M ⊆ BGT, there exist an outer action of M on Π∗
out

out

and an open injection Π∗  M → Π  BGT such that
(a) the outer action of M on Π∗ preserves the set of cuspidal inertia
subgroups of Π∗ ;
(b) the outer action of M on Π∗ extends uniquely [cf. the slimness of Π]
to a Π∗ -outer action on Π that is compatible with the outer action of
out

out

BGT (⊇ M ) on Π; the injection Π∗  M → Π  BGT is the injection
determined by the inclusions Π∗ ⊆ Π and M ⊆ BGT, together with
the Π∗ -outer actions of M on Π∗ and Π.
out

(v) In the notation of (iv), the homomorphism Π∗  M → Aut(Π∗ ) determined by conjugation is injective.
(vi) Let Π∗ be an open subgroup of Π. Then any surjective homomorphism
∼
Π∗  Π∗ of proﬁnite groups that induces a bijection Cusp(Π∗ ) → Cusp(Π∗ )
is an isomorphism.
Proof. Assertion (i) follows immediately from Claim 4.4.F in the proof of Theorem 4.4. Assertion (ii) follows immediately from [MT], Proposition 1.4. Assertion (iii) follows immediately, in light of the second line of the ﬁnal display
of Remark 5.1.3, from Remark 5.1.2. Next, since, in the notation of Deﬁnition
5.1, (i), Π∗ arises as the inverse image in Π of some normal open subgroup of
some ΠB , assertion (iv) follows immediately from a similar argument to the
argument applied in the proof of [Tsjm], Lemma 1.2.
Next, we verify assertion (v). First, we note that since Π, hence also Π∗ ,
out

is slim [cf. (ii)], the restriction of the homomorphism Π∗  M → Aut(Π∗ )
to Π∗ is injective. Note also that since the natural surjection Π  ΠX is
compatible with the respective outer actions of M , and M ⊆ GT ⊆ Out(ΠX ),
the natural homomorphism M → Out(Π) is injective. Since Π is slim, it follows
immediately from condition (b) of assertion (iv) that the natural homomorphism
out

M → Out(Π∗ ) is injective. Thus, we conclude that the homomorphism Π∗ 
M → Aut(Π∗ ) is injective. This completes the proof of assertion (v).
Finally, we verify assertion (vi). Let φ : Π∗  Π∗ be a surjective homomor∼
phism of proﬁnite groups that induces a bijection φcusp : Cusp(Π∗ ) → Cusp(Π∗ ).
∗
∗
Then, for each ﬁnite subset E ⊆ Cusp(Π ), the surjective homomorphism φ
induces a surjective homomorphism φE ∗ : Π∗E ∗  Π∗φcusp (E ∗ ) of proﬁnite groups.
On the other hand, since the cardinality of E ∗ and the cardinality of φcusp (E ∗ )
∼
are equal, there exists an isomorphism Π∗φcusp (E ∗ ) → Π∗E ∗ of proﬁnite groups.
Then since Π∗E ∗ is topologically ﬁnitely generated [hence satisﬁes the “Hopﬁan
55

property”], the surjective homomorphism φE ∗ is an isomorphism. Thus, by allowing E ∗ ⊆ Cusp(Π∗ ) to vary, we conclude that φ is an isomorphism. This
completes the proof of assertion (vi), hence of Proposition 5.2.

that ΠX0∞ acts naturally on D0∞ (J).
(iii) Write

Remark 5.3.1. In the following, we consider certain slightly generalized analogues of [Tsjm], Corollary 1.6, (ii), (iii), obtained by replacing “ΠX ” by ΠX0∞ .
Let J be a closed subgroup of GT ⊆ Out(ΠX ). Then it follows immediately
from a similar argument [cf. also Remarks 3.3.2, 3.3.3] to the proof of [Tsjm],
Corollary 1.6, together with the various deﬁnitions involved, that:
• D0∞ (J) admits a natural action by CGT (J), hence, in particular, by J.
• Let J1 and J2 be closed subgroups of GT. If J1 ⊆ J2 ⊆ GT, then the
inclusion J1 ⊆ J2 induces, by considering the intersection of subgroups of
ΠX0∞  J2 with ΠX0∞  J1 , a natural surjection
D0∞ (J2 )  D0∞ (J1 )
that is equivariant with respect to the natural actions of J1 (⊆ J2 ) on the
domain and codomain.

Lemma 5.4 (Kummer classes of group-theoretic constant functions).
We maintain the notation of Deﬁnitions 4.1, 5.3. Then the following hold:
(i) There exists a natural injection
ιBGT : D0∞ (BGT) →

H 1 (M, ΠX0∞ ),

M ⊆BGT

where M ranges over the normal open subgroups of BGT.
(ii) There exists a natural surjection

(iii) The above maps ιBGT and ψBGT are compatible with the respective natural

(iv) The composite

is a group homomorphism [cf. Theorem 4.4].
Proof. First, we verify assertion (i). Let I1 be a cuspidal inertia subgroup of
ΠX associated to the cusp “1”. Then the image of the normalizer

[cf. [CmbGC], Proposition 1.2, (ii)] of the second to last arrow of the natural
exact sequence
1 −→ ΠX0∞ −→ ΠX0∞  BGT −→ BGT −→ 1.
On the other hand, note that an element x ∈ D0∞ (B , M, BGT), where B
denotes an arithmetic Belyi diagram as in Deﬁnition 5.3, (i) [i.e., where we take
“J” to be BGT], determines a section sx [cf. [CmbGC], Proposition 1.2, (ii)]
of the restriction to M of the second to last arrow of the above exact sequence.
Thus, by forming the diﬀerence κx between sx and the restriction to M of s1 ,
one veriﬁes immediately that the assignment sx → κx determines, by allowing
B ∈ IBGT [hence also “M ”] to vary, a natural map
ιBGT : D0∞ (BGT) →

lim
−→

H 1 (M, ΠX0∞ ),

M ⊆BGT

where M ranges over the normal open subgroups of BGT. Finally, the injectivity
of ιBGT follows immediately from the deﬁnitions of D0∞ (−) and H 1 (−, −). This
completes the proof of assertion (i). Assertion (ii) follows immediately from the
×
deﬁnitions of QBGT and D0∞ (BGT). Assertion (iii) follows immediately from
the deﬁnitions of the natural actions of CGT (BGT) [cf., especially, the proof of
Claim 4.4.G in the proof of Theorem 4.4]. Assertion (iv) follows immediately
from the construction of the multiplication operation on the ﬁeld QBGT [i.e., the
construction of BGT in the proof of Theorem 4.4] by means of the well-known
natural group structure on P1Q \{0, ∞}, i.e., “(Gm )Q ”. This completes the proof
of Lemma 5.4.
In the remainder of the present paper, we shall identify D0∞ (BGT) with
Im(ιBGT ) via the natural injection ιBGT .
Proposition 5.5 (Synchronizations of cuspidal inertia subgroups). We
maintain the notation of Deﬁnition 5.1. Then the following hold:
(i) For each cuspidal inertia subgroup Ix of Π associated to x ∈ Cusp(Π), the
natural scheme-theoretic isomorphism
∼

Ix → ΠX0∞
may be reconstructed, in a purely combinatorial/group-theoretic way, from
the collection of data
(Π; Cusp(Π); {0, ∞} ⊆ Cusp(Π))
consisting of
• a proﬁnite group Π;
58

• a set Cusp(Π) of the conjugacy classes of subgroups of Π;
• a subset {0, ∞} ⊆ Cusp(Π) of cardinality 2 [equipped with labels “0”,
“∞”] of the set Cusp(Π).
(ii) Let Π∗ ⊆ Π be an open subgroup; x ∈ Cusp(Π∗ ); Ix∗ a cuspidal inertia
subgroup of Π∗ associated to x. Then one may construct a natural isomorphism
∼
Ix∗ → ΠX0∞
def

as follows: Write Ix = NΠ (Ix∗ ). Note that Ix = NΠ (Ix ) = CΠ (Ix ) =
CΠ (Ix∗ ) is the unique cuspidal inertia subgroup of Π containing Ix∗ [cf.
Proposition 5.2, (i); [CmbGC], Proposition 1.2, (ii)], and the subgroup
Ix∗ ⊆ Ix is of ﬁnite index m. Then since cuspidal inertia subgroups are
abstractly isomorphic to Z [cf. [CmbGC], Remark 1.1.3], division by m
∼
determines an isomorphism Ix∗ → Ix . Thus, by composing with the iso∼
morphism of (i), we obtain a natural isomorphism Ix∗ → ΠX0∞ .
Proof. First, we verify assertion (i). Let I0 be a cuspidal inertia subgroup of Π
associated to the cusp “0 ∈ Cusp(Π)”. Write
Π  Π{0,x}
for the quotient proﬁnite group of Π obtained by forming the quotient of Π
by the normal closed subgroup topologically generated by the cuspidal inertia
subgroups associated to Cusp(Π) \ {0, x}. Then the surjection Π  Π{0,x}
induces isomorphisms
∼

∼

α0 : I0 → Π{0,x} ,

αx : Ix → Π{0,x} .

∼

∼

Write α : Ix → I0 for the composite of α0−1 ◦ αx with the inversion map I0 → I0 .
∼
Thus, α and the natural surjection Π  ΠX0∞ determine an isomorphsm Ix →
ΠX0∞ . The desired functoriality follows immediately from the construction.
This completes the proof of assertion (i).
Assertion (ii) follows immediately from the various deﬁnitions involved. This
completes the proof of Proposition 5.5.

• an open injection fM : Π∗  M → Π  BGT

(a) the outer action of M on Π∗ preserves the set of cuspidal inertia subgroups

Π∗ -outer actions of M on Π∗ and Π
[cf. Proposition 5.2, (iv)]. Write
I(Π∗ , Π)
for the set of open injections fΠ∗ : Π∗ → Π satisfying the following properties:
(1) For each cuspidal inertia subgroup I ∗ of Π∗ , the commensurator CΠ (fΠ∗ (I ∗ ))
of fΠ∗ (I ∗ ) in Π is a cuspidal inertia subgroup of Π [which implies, by
Proposition 5.5, (ii), that CΠ (fΠ∗ (I ∗ )) = NΠ (fΠ∗ (I ∗ ))].
∗
(2) For each cuspidal inertia subgroup I of Π, the inverse image fΠ−1
∗ (I) ⊆ Π
is a cuspidal inertia subgroup of Π∗ .

(3) Let I ∗ be a cuspidal inertia subgroup of Π∗ ; I a cuspidal inertia subgroup

Remark 5.6.2. In the notation of Deﬁnition 5.6, let Π∗∗ ⊆ Π be an open subgroup contained in Π∗ . Then the inclusion Π∗∗ ⊆ Π∗ determines a natural map

the proof of Proposition 5.7.

Deﬁnition 5.8. We maintain the notation of Deﬁnition 5.6. Let fΠ∗ ∈ I(Π∗ , Π);
x ∈ Cusp(Π∗ ); Ix a cuspidal inertia subgroup of Π∗ associated to x. Then we
deﬁne the value

Then the above construction of KΠ

deed, since (Π∅ )ab = {0} [hence, in particular, H 1 (N ∗ , (Π∅ )ab ) = {0}], it
follows immediately from the various deﬁnitions involved that κΠ{0,∞} maps
κ
. Thus,
id ∈ I{0,∞} (Π, Π) [cf. Proposition 5.5, (ii)] to an element of KΠ
{0,∞}

since any element fΠ∗ ∈ IS (Π , Π) may be thought of as the pull-back “via
66

fΠ∗ ” of id ∈ I{0,∞} (Π, Π), by applying the functoriality of the constructions
involved [cf. also Deﬁnition 5.6, (3)], we obtain the desired conclusion.
Next, we apply our assumption that DΠ∗S |KΠκ∗ is injective. Thus, since the
S

above diagram is commutative, there exists a unique map Im(FΠ∗ ,S ) → Im(κΠ∗S )
compatible with the maps FΠ∗ ,S and κΠ∗S in the desired sense. In particular,
since all of the constructions involved are functorially compatible with enlargement of the ﬁnite subset S ⊆ Cusp(Π∗ ), by allowing S ⊆ Cusp(Π∗ ) to vary, we
obtain a natural map
Im(FΠ∗ ) → lim H 1 (Π∗N ∗ , ΠX0∞ )

Thus, since LΠ∗ = Im FΠ∗ ∪ Im BΠ∗ [where we note that Im FΠ∗ ∩ Im BΠ∗ = ∅
— cf. Remark 5.9.2], we obtain the desired conclusion. This completes the
proof of Lemma 5.11.
Deﬁnition 5.12. Let BGT ⊆ GT be a closed subgroup satisfying the BCproperty [cf. Deﬁnition 3.3, (v)]. We apply the notation of Deﬁnitions 4.1,
5.1, 5.6, 5.8, 5.9. Write t ∈ LΠ for the element determined by id ∈ I(Π, Π)
[cf. Proposition 5.5, (ii)]. Then, if BGT satisﬁes the following conditions (i),
(ii), (iii) (respectively, (i), (ii), (iii), (iv)), then we shall say that BGT satisﬁes
the QAA-property [i.e., “quasi-algebraically ample property”] (respectively, AAproperty [i.e., “algebraically ample property”]):
(i) Write (QBGT )div ⊆ QBGT for the subﬁeld generated over Q by Ker(ιBGT ◦
ψBGT ) [cf. Lemma 5.4, (iv)]. Then (QBGT )div ⊆ QBGT is an inﬁnite
extension of ﬁelds.
(ii) For
• each normal open subgroup Π† ⊆ Π,
• each nonempty ﬁnite subset S ⊆ Cusp(Π† ), and
• any suﬃciently small normal open subgroup N † of BGT,
it holds that H 1 (Π†∅ , ΠX0∞ )N = {0} [cf. Deﬁnition 5.10], and the restricκ

(iii) Assume that condition (ii) holds. There exists a family of subsets
{KΠ† ⊆ LΠ† }Π† ⊆Π
— where Π† ranges over the normal open subgroups of Π — satisfying the
following conditions:
(a) Let Π‡ ⊆ Π† be normal open subgroups of Π. Then the natural injection LΠ† → LΠ‡ [determined by the natural surjection Cusp(Π‡ ) 
Cusp(Π† ) — cf. Proposition 5.5, (ii); Remarks 5.6.2, 5.9.2] induces
an injection
KΠ† → KΠ‡ .
In the remainder of the present paper, we regard KΠ† as a subset of
KΠ‡ via this injection.
(b) For each normal open subgroup Π† ⊆ Π, and each ﬁnite subset R ⊆
Cusp(Π† ), the restriction to KΠ† of the natural restriction map
Fn(Cusp(Π† ), QBGT ∪ {∞})  Fn(Cusp(Π† ) \ R, QBGT ∪ {∞})
is injective.
(c) For each normal open subgroup Π† ⊆ Π, KΠ† admits a [necessarily
unique — cf. (b)] ﬁeld structure compatible with the ring structure
of Fn(Cusp(Π† ), QBGT ) in the following sense: Let f, g ∈ KΠ† , T ⊆
Cusp(Π† ) a ﬁnite subset such that f (x), g(x) ∈ QBGT for any x ∈
Cusp(Π† ) \ T . [For given elements f, g ∈ KΠ† , the existence of such a
ﬁnite set T follows immediately from Remark 5.9.2.] Then the images
of f + g and f g via the restriction map
Fn(Cusp(Π† ), QBGT ∪ {∞})  Fn(Cusp(Π† ) \ T, QBGT ∪ {∞})
coincide, respectively, with the functions
Cusp(Π† ) \ T  x → f (x) + g(x) ∈ QBGT ,
Cusp(Π† ) \ T  x → f (x)g(x) ∈ QBGT .
Moreover, relative to these unique ﬁeld structures, KΠ ⊆ KΠ† is a
ﬁnite Galois extension.
(d) QBGT = Im BΠ ⊆ KΠ , and t ∈ KΠ . Moreover, if we write QBGT (t) ⊆
KΠ for the subﬁeld generated by QBGT and t, then KΠ = QBGT (t).
(e) For each normal open subgroup Π† ⊆ Π, the natural action of Π on
LΠ† [cf. Proposition 5.2, (iv)] preserves KΠ† . Moreover, the natural
homomorphism
Π/Π† → Gal(KΠ† /KΠ )
is an isomorphism.

(i)], that GF satisﬁes the AA-property [cf. the proof of Theorem 6.8, (i), below,
for more details].
Remark 5.12.2. In condition (iv), we regard ΠX2 as an abstract topological
group and ΠX as a quotient of ΠX2 , i.e., as in Corollary 4.5 [cf. also Remark
4.5.1].

Lemma 5.13 (Geometric interpretation of the set of cuspidal inertia
subgroups of Π). Suppose that BGT satisﬁes conditions (ii), (iii) of Deﬁnition

QBGT -valued points of YΠ† . Then the natural map
evΠ† : Cusp(Π† ) → YΠ† (QBGT )
induced by evaluating elements of KΠ† at elements of Cusp(Π† ) is bijective.

the natural map evΠ† : Cusp(Π† ) → YΠ† (QBGT ) is compatible with the isomor∼
phism Π/Π† → Gal(KΠ† /KΠ ) [cf. Deﬁnition 5.12, (iii), (e)] and the respective
natural actions of Π/Π† and Gal(KΠ† /KΠ ). Thus, it follows immediately from
the transitivity of the natural action of Gal(KΠ† /KΠ ) on the ﬁbers of the ﬁnite
ramiﬁed Galois covering YΠ† → P1Q
that evΠ† is surjective.

respective natural actions of Π and Gal(KΠ /QBGT (t)).
Suppose that evΠ† (c1 ) = evΠ† (c2 ), where c1 , c2 ∈ Cusp(Π† ). Let I1 ⊆ Π† ,
I2 ⊆ Π† , J ⊆ Gal(KΠ /KΠ† ) be cuspidal inertia subgroups associated to c1 ,
70

c2 , evΠ† (c1 ), respectively. Thus, since ev is compatible with the isomorphism

Π† → Gal(KΠ /KΠ† ) and the respective natural actions, one veriﬁes immediately
that by choosing suitable conjugates of I1 , I2 , and J, we may assume without
∼
loss of generality that the natural isomorphism Π† → Gal(KΠ /KΠ† ) induces
inclusions ι1 : I1 → J, ι2 : I2 → J. Next, observe that any cuspidal inertia

and that every cuspidal inertia subgroup of Gal(KΠ /KΠ† ) is isomorphic to Z.
Thus, we conclude that J is abelian, and hence, by applying the inclusions ι1 ,
ι2 , that I1 ⊆ NΠ† (I2 ), I2 ⊆ NΠ† (I1 ), which [cf. Proposition 5.5, (ii)] implies
that I1 = I2 , as desired. This completes the proof of the injectivity of evΠ† and
hence of assertion (i).
Next, we verify assertion (ii). Recall from Proposition 5.2, (i), that there

exists an isomorphism ξ : Π → Gal(KΠ

particular, since the natural isomorphism Π → Gal(KΠ /QBGT (t)) [cf. Deﬁnition 5.12, (iii), (e)] induces a bijection between the respective sets of cuspidal

various deﬁnitions involved that Π  CGT (BGT) acts naturally on the family

the natural surjection Π  ΠX is compatible with the respective outer actions

Lemma 5.16 (Elementary property of proﬁnite groups). Let G be a
proﬁnite group, H ⊆ G a closed subgroup, g ∈ G an element such that H ⊆
H g := g · H · g −1 . Then H = H g .
Proof. By considering quotients of G by normal open subgroups, one reduces
immediately to the case where G is ﬁnite. Then the equality H = H g follows
immediately from the fact that H and H g have the same cardinality. This
completes the proof of Lemma 5.16.

Q may be constructed from the abstract topological group ΠX2 [cf. Corollary 4.5, Remark 4.5.1], in a purely combinatorial/group-theoretic way, as
the set of maximal elements [relative to the relation of inclusion] in the
set of closed subgroups of Out|C| (ΠX ) that arise as Out|C| (ΠX )-conjugates
of closed subgroups of GT that satisfy the QAA-property [cf. Deﬁnitions
3.3, (v); 5.12].
(ii) The conjugacy class of subgroups of GT determined by the absolute
Galois group of Q may be constructed from the abstract topological group
ΠX2 [cf. Corollary 4.5, Remark 4.5.1], in a purely combinatorial/grouptheoretic way, as the set of maximal elements [relative to the relation
of inclusion] in the set of closed subgroups of GT that arise as closed
subgroups of GT that satisfy the AA-property [cf. Deﬁnitions 3.3, (v);
5.12].
Proof. Recall from Remark 5.12.1 that GQ = Gal(Q/Q) may be regarded as a
closed subgroup of GT that satisﬁes the AA-property, hence may itself be taken
to be “BGT”. Thus, it follows formally from Theorem 5.15, (ii) [cf. also Lemma
5.13, (ii)] (respectively, Theorem 5.15, (iv)), that any Out|C| (ΠX )-conjugate
(respectively, GT-conjugate) of a closed subgroup of GT that satisﬁes the QAAproperty (respectively, AA-property) is contained in — hence equal to, whenever
it is maximal with respect to the relation of inclusion among such conjugates of
closed subgroups — some Out|C| (ΠX )-conjugate (respectively, GT-conjugate) of
GQ . In particular, the maximality of any Out|C| (ΠX )-conjugate (respectively,
GT-conjugate) of GQ follows formally from Lemma 5.16. This completes the
proof of Theorem 5.17.

Application to semi-absolute anabelian geometry over TKND-AVKF-ﬁelds

In this section, we introduce the notion of a TKND-AVKF-ﬁeld [cf. Definition 6.6, (iii)] and show that the absolute Galois group of a TKND-AVKF
subﬁeld of Q satisﬁes the AA-property [cf. Theorem 6.8, (i)]. We then apply the
theory developed in the present paper to prove a semi-absolute version of the
Grothendieck Conjecture for higher dimensional conﬁguration spaces [of dimension ≥ 2] associated to hyperbolic curves of genus 0 over TKND-AVKF-ﬁelds
[cf. Theorem 6.10, (ii)].
Write Qab (⊆ Q) for the maximal abelian extension of Q.
Deﬁnition 6.1. Let p ∈ Primes; Σ ⊆ Primes a nonempty subset.
(i) Let M be an abelian group. Then we shall say that M is p∞ -tor-ﬁnite if
the subgroup of p-power torsion elements of M is ﬁnite. We shall say that
M is Σ∞ -tor-ﬁnite if, for each l ∈ Σ, M is l∞ -tor-ﬁnite.
(ii) Let G be a proﬁnite group. Then we shall say that G is p-subfree if there
exists a closed subgroup of G isomorphic to Zp . We shall say that G is
Σ-subfree if, for each l ∈ Σ, G is l-subfree. We shall say that G is p-sparse
if the maximal pro-p quotient of every open subgroup of G is ﬁnite. We
shall say that G is Σ-sparse if, for each l ∈ Σ, G is l-sparse.
(iii) Let K be a ﬁeld. If K satisﬁes the following condition, then we shall say
that K is an AVKF-ﬁeld [i.e., “abelian variety Kummer-faithful ﬁeld”]:
Let A be an abelian variety over a ﬁnite extension L of K.
Write A(L)∞ for the group of divisible elements ∈ A(L). Then
A(L)∞ = {1}.
If K is an AVKF-ﬁeld, then we shall also say that K is AVKF.
(iv) Let K be a ﬁeld. If K satisﬁes the following condition, then we shall say
that K is p-AV-tor-indivisible (respectively, p∞ -AV-tor-ﬁnite):
Let A be an abelian variety over a ﬁnite extension L of K. Write
∞
• A(L)p for the group of p-divisible elements ∈ A(L);
• A(L)∞ for the group of torsion elements ∈ A(L);
• A(L)p∞ for the group of p-power torsion elements ∈ A(L).
∞
Then A(L)p ⊆ A(L)∞ (respectively, A(L)p∞ is ﬁnite).
We shall say that K is Σ-AV-tor-indivisible (respectively, Σ∞ -AV-torﬁnite) if, for each l ∈ Σ, K is l∞ -AV-tor-ﬁnite.
(v) Let K be a ﬁeld. Then we shall say that K is stably Σ-×μ-indivisible (respectively, stably μΣ∞ -ﬁnite) if, for each l ∈ Σ, K is stably l-×μ-indivisible
(respectively, stably μl∞ -ﬁnite) [cf. [Tsjm], Deﬁnition 3.3, (v), (vii)].
76

Remark 6.1.1. If a proﬁnite group G is Σ-subfree (respectively, Σ-sparse), then
so is any open subgroup of G.
Remark 6.1.2. Let  be one of the following properties:
• AVKF,
• Σ-AV-tor-indivisible,
• Σ∞ -AV-tor-ﬁnite,
• stably Σ-×μ-indivisible,
• stably μΣ∞ -ﬁnite.
Then one veriﬁes immediately that if L is an extension ﬁeld of a ﬁeld K, then
the following implication holds:
L is  ⇒ K is .
Remark 6.1.3. In the notation of Deﬁnition 6.1, (iii), suppose further that K
is of characteristic 0. Then it follows immediately from [AbsTopIII], Deﬁnition
1.5, that the following implication concerning K holds:


torally Kummer-faithful and AVKF
⇐⇒ Kummer-faithful.

Lemma 6.2 (Stably p-×μ-indivisible and p-AV-tor-indivisible ﬁelds).
Let p ∈ Primes, K a ﬁeld of characteristic = p. Then:
(i) Let L be a [not necessarily ﬁnite!] Galois extension of K such that
Gal(L/K) is p-sparse. Let  be one of the following properties:
• stably p-×μ-indivisible,
• stably μp∞ -ﬁnite,
• p-AV-tor-indivisible,
• p∞ -AV-tor-ﬁnite.
Then if K is , then so is L.
(ii) Let L be a [not necessarily ﬁnite!] Galois extension of K.
(ii× ) Suppose that L is stably μp∞ -ﬁnite. Then if K is stably p-×μindivisible, then so is L.
(iiAV ) Suppose that L is p∞ -AV-tor-ﬁnite.
indivisible, then so is L.
(iii) The following properties hold:

77

Then if K is p-AV-tor-

(iii× ) Suppose that K is stably p-×μ-indivisible, stably μPrimes∞ -ﬁnite,
and of characteristic 0. Then K is torally Kummer-faithful. If,
moreover, K is AVKF, then K is Kummer-faithful [cf. Remark
6.1.3].
(iiiAV ) Suppose that K is p-AV-tor-indivisible and Primes∞ -AV-torﬁnite. Then K is AVKF.
(iv) The following properties hold:
(iv× ) If K is torally Kummer-faithful, then K is stably μPrimes∞ ﬁnite.
(ivAV ) If K is AVKF, then K is Primes∞ -AV-tor-ﬁnite.
(v) Suppose that K is a sub-p-adic ﬁeld [cf. [LocAn], Deﬁnition 15.4, (i)].
Then K is
• stably p-×μ-indivisible,
• stably μPrimes∞ -ﬁnite,
• p-AV-tor-indivisible,
• Primes∞ -AV-tor-ﬁnite.
Proof. First, we consider assertion (i). We begin by observing that any ﬁnite
extension ﬁeld L† of L arises as a Galois extension of some ﬁnite extension ﬁeld
K † of K such that Gal(L† /K † ) is p-sparse. Next, we observe that the Galois
group Gal(M/K) of any [not necessarily ﬁnite!] Galois extension M of K that
arises by
• adjoining compatible systems of p-power roots of elements of K or by
• adjoining inﬁnitely many p-power roots of unity,
admits an open subgroup which is a pro-p group. Assertion (i) in the case where
 is taken to be one of the ﬁrst two properties then follows immediately from the
above observations, together with our assumption that Gal(L/K) is p-sparse.
Assertion (i) in the case where  is taken to be one of the latter two properties
follows by a similar argument. This completes the proof of assertion (i).
Assertion (ii× ) follows immediately from [Tsjm], Lemma D, (v). Next, we
verify assertion (iiAV ). Let L† be a ﬁnite extension ﬁeld of L; A† an abelian
∞
variety over L† . To verify assertion (iiAV ), it suﬃces to prove that A† (L† )p ⊆
∞
A† (L† )∞ . Let x ∈ A† (L† )p . By replacing K by a ﬁnite extension ﬁeld of K,
we may assume without loss of generality that
• L† = L;
• A† = A ×K L, where A is an abelian variety over K;
• x ∈ A(K).
Thus, since K is p-AV-tor-indivisible, it suﬃces to verify the following assertion:
∞

Claim 6.2.A: x ∈ A(K)p .

78

Indeed, let n be a positive integer. Since L is p∞ -AV-tor-ﬁnite, A(L)p∞ is ﬁnite.
∞
Write pm for the cardinality of A(L)p∞ . Then since x ∈ A(L)p , there exists
def

an element xm+n ∈ A(L) such that pm+n · xm+n = x. Write xn = pm · xm+n .
Thus, since pn · xn = x, it suﬃces to prove that xn ∈ A(K). Let σ ∈ Gal(L/K).
Observe that
pm+n · ((xm+n )σ − xm+n ) = xσ − x = 0,
hence, in particular, that (xm+n )σ − xm+n ∈ A(L)p∞ . Thus, we conclude that
xσn − xn = pm · ((xm+n )σ − xm+n ) = 0,
hence that xn ∈ A(K). This completes the proof of Claim 6.2.A, hence of
assertion (iiAV ).
Assertions (iii× ), (iiiAV ) follow immediately from the fact that, for any l ∈
Primes, the divisible group Ql /Zl has no nontrivial ﬁnite quotient.
Next, we verify assertion (iv). Recall that, for any l ∈ Primes, the group of
l-torsion points of an abelian variety over an algebraically closed ﬁeld is ﬁnite
[cf. e.g., [Mumf], p. 64]. Thus, assertion (iv) follows immediately from the fact
that, for any l ∈ Primes, every inﬁnite subgroup of Ql /Zl is divisible.
Assertion (v) follows immediately from a similar argument to the argument
applied in [AbsTopIII], Remark 1.5.4, (i). This completes the proof of Lemma
6.2.

Remark 6.2.1. The argument applied in the proof of Claim 6.2.A [in the proof
of Lemma 6.2, (iiAV )] is similar to the argument applied in the proof of [Moon],
Proposition 7.
Proposition 6.3 (Examples of AVKF-ﬁelds). Let F ⊆ Q be a number ﬁeld.
(i) Let L be a [not necessarily ﬁnite!] Galois extension of F · Qab ⊆ Q such
that Gal(L/F · Qab ) is Primes-sparse. Then L is
• stably Primes-×μ-indivisible,
• Primes-AV-tor-indivisible,
• Primes∞ -AV-tor-ﬁnite.
In particular, L is a stably ×μ-indivisible AVKF-ﬁeld [cf. Lemma
6.2, (iiiAV ); [Tsjm], Lemma D, (i)].
(ii) Let {v1 , v2 , . . . } be an inﬁnite set of non-archimedean primes of F . [Here,
we assume, for simplicity, that the indices of the “vj ” are chosen in such
a way that vj = vj  for j = j  .] Let {Σj ⊆ Primes}j≥1 be a family of
subsets such that, for any positive integer j,

Σi = Primes,
i≥j

79

where i ranges over the positive integers ≥ j; M ⊆ Q a [not necessarily
ﬁnite!] Galois extension of F ; L a [not necessarily ﬁnite!] Galois
extension of M ⊆ Q such that Gal(L/M ) is Primes-sparse. Suppose
that for each positive integer j, the absolute Galois group of the residue
ﬁeld of the ring of integers of M at [every prime that divides] vj is Σj subfree. Then L is
• stably Primes-×μ-indivisible,
• stably μPrimes∞ -ﬁnite,
• Primes-AV-tor-indivisible,
• Primes∞ -AV-tor-ﬁnite.
In particular, L is a Kummer-faithful ﬁeld [cf. Lemma 6.2, (iii× ),
(iiiAV )].
Proof. First, we verify assertion (i). Note that it follows immediately from
Lemma 6.2, (i), that we may assume without loss of generality that L = F · Qab .
Then since L is an abelian extension of a number ﬁeld, it follows immediately
from [Tsjm], Lemma D, (iii), (iv), that L is stably Primes-×μ-indivisible. On
the other hand, it follows immediately from [KLR], Appendix, Theorem 1, that
L is Primes∞ -AV-tor-ﬁnite. Next, observe that F is Primes-AV-tor-indivisible
[cf. Lemma 6.2, (v)]. Thus, since L is a Primes∞ -AV-tor-ﬁnite Galois extension
of F , we conclude from Lemma 6.2, (iiAV ), that L is Primes-AV-tor-indivisible.
This completes the proof of assertion (i).
Next, we verify assertion (ii). Note that it follows immediately from Lemma
6.2, (i), that we may assume without loss of generality that L = M . For each
positive integer j, write pj for the residue characteristic of vj . Then it follows
immediately from our assumption on various unions of the subsets Σi ⊆ Primes
that, for any positive integer j,

Σi \ {pi } = Primes,
i≥j

where i ranges over the positive integers ≥ j. Let p ∈ Primes; L† a ﬁnite
extension of L; A† an abelian variety over L† ; j a positive integer such that
p ∈ Σj \ {pj }, and A† has good reduction at some prime ṽj of L† that divides
vj [cf. the above display!]. Write
• Oṽ†j ⊆ L† for the ring of integers at ṽj ;

• kṽ†j for the residue ﬁeld of Oṽ†j ;

• A†j for the abelian scheme over Oṽ†j whose generic ﬁber is A† ;

• A†ṽj = A†j ×O† kṽ†j .
def

ṽj

Then since the morphism A†j → A†j given by multiplication by a power of p is
ﬁnite étale, it follows immediately that there exists a natural injection
A† (L† )p∞ → A†ṽj (kṽ†j ).
Thus, it follows immediately from
80

• our assumption [cf. Remark 6.1.1] that the absolute Galois group of kṽ†j is
Σj -subfree,
• the well-known fact that the absolute Galois group of a ﬁnite ﬁeld is isomorphic to Z, and
• the well-known fact that, for any positive integer n, GLn (Zp ) contains an
open subgroup which is a pro-p-group
that A† (L† )p∞ is ﬁnite. Thus, by allowing p to vary, we conclude that L
is Primes∞ -AV-tor-ﬁnite. A similar argument applied to the multiplicative
group Gm implies that L is stably μPrimes∞ -ﬁnite. Next, observe that L is a
Primes∞ -AV-tor-ﬁnite Galois extension of the Primes-AV-tor-indivisible ﬁeld
F [cf. Lemma 6.2, (v)]. Thus, we conclude from Lemma 6.2, (iiAV ), that L is
Primes-AV-tor-indivisible. A similar argument implies that L is stably Primes×μ-indivisible. This completes the proof of assertion (ii), hence of Proposition
6.3.

Remark 6.3.1. The following example was suggested to the authors of the
present paper by A. Tamagawa. Let {Gi }i∈I be a family of nonabelian ﬁnite
simple groups [i.e., such as the alternating group on n letters An , where n ≥ 5].
Then the direct product group

def
G =
Gi
i∈I

endowed with the product topology is Primes-sparse. Indeed, this follows immediately from the deﬁnition of the product topology, together with the elementary
fact that, for each p ∈ Primes, i ∈ I, the maximal pro-p quotient of Gi is trivial.
If I is countable, and we assume that Gi and Gj are non-isomorphic whenever
I  i = j ∈ I, then it follows immediately from the well-known fact that number
ﬁelds are Hilbertian [cf. [FJ], §6.2; [FJ], Theorem 13.4.2] that G may be realized
as the Galois group of a Galois extension E of a number ﬁeld F . Here, we note
that such a Galois extension E of F is necessarily linearly disjoint from any
abelian ﬁeld extension of F .
Remark 6.3.2. Later [cf. Remark 6.6.3 below], we shall see that the ﬁelds “L”
of Proposition 6.3, (i), (ii), are in fact “TKND-AVKF-ﬁelds”.
√
Remark 6.3.3. Let F ⊆ Q be a number ﬁeld such that −1 ∈ F ; {v1 , v2 , . . . }
an inﬁnite set of non-archimedean primes of F . [Here, we assume, for simplicity,
that the indices of the “vj ” are chosen in such a way that vj = vj  for j = j  .]
Let {Σj ⊆ Primes}j≥1 be a family of ﬁnite subsets such that, for any positive
integer j,

Σi = Primes,
i≥j

81

where i ranges over the positive integers ≥ j. For each positive integer j, write
Primes \ Σj = {pj,m }m≥1 ; Fvj for the completion of F at vj . For each pair
of positive integers i, j such that j ≤ i, write Fv†j [i] for the ﬁnite unramiﬁed
[abelian] extension of Fvj of degree


pij,m .

1≤m≤i

For each positive integer j, let Fv‡j be an abelian totally wildly ramiﬁed inﬁnite
extension of Fvj . For each pair of positive integers i, j such that j ≤ i, let
Fv‡j [i] ⊆ Fv‡j be a ﬁnite subextension of Fvj such that


Fv‡j [i] ⊆ Fv‡j [i + 1],

Fv‡j [m] = Fv‡j ,

j≤m

where m ranges over the positive integers ≥ j. [Here, we observe that the
existence of such extensions of Fvj follows immediately from [Neu], Chapter
II, Proposition 10.2; [Neu], Chapter V, Theorems 1.3, 6.2.] Next, let i be
a positive integer; Mi an abelian extension of F such that, for each pair of
positive integers i, j such that j ≤ i, the local extensions of Mi /F at vj coincide
with the extension Fv†j [i] · Fv‡j [i]/Fvj . [Here, we observe that, in light of our
√
assumption that −1 ∈ F , the existence of such an abelian extension Mi of
F follows immediately from [NSW], Deﬁnitions 9.1.5, 9.1.7; [NSW], Theorem
9.2.8.] Write
M ⊆Q
for the ﬁeld generated by {Mi }i≥1 over F . Then we make the following observations, each of which follows immediately from the construction of M :
(a) M is an abelian extension of F ;
(b) for each positive integer j, the absolute Galois group of the residue ﬁeld of
the ring of integers of M at [every prime that divides] vj is Σj -subfree;
(c) for each positive integer j, the ramiﬁcation index of the extension M/F at
vj is inﬁnite [so if {v1 , v2 , . . . } coincides with the set of all non-archimedean
primes of F , then M is not a generalized sub-p-adic ﬁeld for any prime
number p — cf. [AnabTop], Deﬁnition 4.11];
(d) for each positive integer j, the residue ﬁeld of the ring of integers of M at
[every prime that divides] vj is inﬁnite.
Thus, in particular, any Galois extension L of M whose Galois group is Primesdef
sparse — such as, for instance, a composite ﬁeld L = M · E, where E is as in
Remark 6.3.1 — satisﬁes the assumptions of Proposition 6.3, (ii), as well as the
properties discussed in (c), (d).

82

Remark 6.3.4. Note that it follows immediately from the various deﬁnitions
involved that the ﬁeld “L” of Proposition 6.3, (i), satisﬁes properties analogous
to the properties (c), (d) of Remark 6.3.3. That is to say, in the notation of
Proposition 6.3, (i),
• the ramiﬁcation index of the extension L/F at every non-archimedean
prime of L is inﬁnite [so L is not a generalized sub-p-adic ﬁeld for any
prime number p — cf. [AnabTop], Deﬁnition 4.11];
• the residue ﬁeld of the ring of integers of L at every non-archimedean
prime of L is algebraically closed, hence inﬁnite.

Remark 6.3.5. The properties (c), (d) of Remark 6.3.3 [cf. also Remark 6.3.4]
are of interest in that they show that
anabelian geometry over ﬁelds such as the ﬁelds L of Proposition
6.3, (i), (ii) [cf. Theorem 6.10 below] cannot be treated by means
of well-known techniques of anabelian geometry that require the
use of p-adic Hodge theory or Frobenius elements of absolute Galois
groups of ﬁnite ﬁelds [cf. [Tama], Theorem 0.4; [LocAn], Theorem
A; [AnabTop], Theorem 4.12].

Corollary 6.4 (AVKF-ﬁelds satisfy the CS-property). Let K ⊆ Q be
def

def

an AVKF-ﬁeld [cf. Deﬁnition 6.1, (iii)]. Write GK = Gal(Q/K) ⊆ GQ =
Gal(Q/Q). Thus, we obtain natural injections
GK ⊆ GQ → GT ⊆ Out(ΠX )

[cf. the discussion of the beginning of [Tsjm], Introduction], which we use to
identify GK with its image in GT. Then the closed subgroup GK ⊆ GT satisﬁes
the CS-property.
Proof. Indeed, it follows immediately from a similar argument to the argument
applied in the proof of [Tsjm], Theorem 3.1, and [Tsjm], Corollary 3.2, that
(ISC) the injectivity portion of the Section Conjecture for arbitrary hyperbolic
curves over AVKF-ﬁelds holds.
The CS-property for the closed subgroup GK ⊆ GT then follows formally from
this property (ISC). This completes the proof of Corollary 6.4.

Corollary 6.5 (AVKF-ﬁelds satisfy the BC-property). In the notation
of Corollary 6.4, the closed subgroup GK ⊆ GT satisﬁes the BC-property.
Moreover, if one takes “BGT” to be GK [cf. Deﬁnition 3.3, (v)], then the
following hold:
83

(i) In the notation of Theorem 4.4, there exists a natural isomorphism of
ﬁelds
∼
Q GK → Q
that is compatible with the inclusion GK ⊆ GQ . In the remainder of the
present §6, we shall use this natural isomorphism to identify QGK with Q.
(ii) In the notation of Deﬁnition 5.1, there exists a natural outer isomorphism
∼
Π → GK X
between the proﬁnite group Π and the absolute Galois group GKX of
def

the function ﬁeld KX of X = P1Q \{0, 1, ∞}. This natural outer isomorphism is compatible with the respective natural outer actions of BGT = GK
on Π and GKX .
(iii) There exists a natural homomorphism
CGT (GK ) → GQ
[cf. Theorem 4.4] whose restriction to GK is the natural inclusion GK ⊆
GQ .
Proof. First, we observe that it follows immediately — from the evident schemetheoretic interpretation of the various arithmetic Belyi diagrams that arise —
that the closed subgroup GK ⊆ GT satisﬁes the COF-property. Thus, it follows immediately from Corollaries 3.7, 6.4, together with the various deﬁnitions
involved, that the closed subgroup GK ⊆ GT satisﬁes the BC-property. Next,
we observe that it follows immediately — from the evident scheme-theoretic
interpretation of the various arithmetic Belyi diagrams that arise — that these
arithmetic Belyi diagrams determine
∼

• a natural isomorphism of ﬁelds QGK → Q that is compatible with the
inclusion GK ⊆ GQ , and
∼

• a natural outer isomorphism Π → GKX that is compatible with the respective natural outer actions of BGT = GK on Π and GKX
[cf. Claim 4.4.F in the proof of Theorem 4.4]. Thus, we conclude [cf. the proof
of Theorem 4.4] that there exists a natural homomorphism
CGT (GK ) → GQ
whose restriction to GK is the natural inclusion GK ⊆ GQ . This completes the
proof of Corollary 6.5.

Deﬁnition 6.6. Let K be a ﬁeld, K an algebraic closure of K. Write Kprm ⊆ K
for the prime ﬁeld of K.
84

(i) Write
def

Kdiv =



L×∞ ⊆ K,

L/K

where L (⊆ K) ranges over the ﬁnite extensions of K, and we write
L×∞ = Kprm (L×∞ ) ⊆ L.
def

(ii) If Kdiv ⊆ K is an inﬁnite ﬁeld extension, then we shall say that K is a
TKND-ﬁeld [i.e., “torally Kummer-nondegenerate ﬁeld”]. If K is a TKNDﬁeld, then we shall say that K is TKND.
(iii) If K ⊆ K is both TKND and AVKF, then we shall say that K is a
TKND-AVKF-ﬁeld. If K is a TKND-AVKF-ﬁeld, then we shall say that
K is TKND-AVKF.
Remark 6.6.1. One veriﬁes immediately that if L is an algebraic extension of a
ﬁeld K, then the following implication holds:
L is TKND ⇒ K is TKND.
Remark 6.6.2. In the notation of Deﬁnition 6.6, suppose further that K is
of characteristic 0. Then the following implications concerning K hold [cf.
Deﬁnition 6.1, (iii); [AbsTopIII], Deﬁnition 1.5; [Tsjm], Deﬁnition 3.3, (v); the
well-known fact that Qab ⊆ Q is an inﬁnite ﬁeld extension]:
torally Kummer-faithful ⇒ stably ×μ-indivisible ⇒ TKND;
Kummer-faithful ⇒ stably ×μ-indivisible and AVKF ⇒ TKND-AVKF.
Remark 6.6.3. It follows immediately from Remark 6.6.2 that the ﬁelds “L” of
Proposition 6.3, (i), (ii), are TKND-AVKF-ﬁelds.
Remark 6.6.4. Recall that
• the TKND-ﬁeld “L” of Proposition 6.3, (i) [cf. Remark 6.6.3], contains
the entire subset μ(Q), while
• the TKND-ﬁeld “L” of Proposition 6.3, (ii) [cf. Remark 6.6.3], is stably
μPrimes∞ -ﬁnite.
That is to say, the TKND-ﬁelds of Proposition 6.3, (i), (ii), may be thought of
as two “extremal cases”, i.e., with regard to the property of containing roots
of unity. On the other hand, a detailed analysis of the various “intermediate
cases” that, in some sense, lie in between these two “extremal cases” is beyond
the scope of the present paper.

for the Kummer map, where μZ (K) = Hom(Q/Z, μ(K)); K † (⊆ K) ranges
over the ﬁnite extensions of K. Let y ∈ Y (K † ), where K † (⊆ K) is a ﬁnite
extension of K. Thus, y ∈ Y (K † ) determines a section GK † → ΠYK † [i.e.,
strictly speaking, an outer homomorphism] of the natural surjection ΠYK † 

(ii) Suppose that

• the function ﬁeld of YQ is equipped with the structure of a ﬁnite Galois

We apply the notation of Deﬁnition 5.9, (ii), where we take “BGT” to
be GK [cf. Corollary 6.5], “Π∗ ⊆ Π” to be the normal open subgroup
determined by YQ [cf. Corollary 6.5, (ii)], and “S ⊆ Cusp(Π∗ )” to be the

(iii) Suppose that K is TKND-AVKF. Then the restriction DY |Im(κY ) of DY

YK is naturally isomorphic to the Tate module of the Jacobian
GK

= {1}, then there exists a nontrivial divisible

Thus, we conclude that H 1 (ΠYK , μZ (K))GK = {0}. This completes the proof
of assertion (i). Assertion (ii) follows immediately from the various deﬁnitions
involved [cf. the argument applied in the proof of [Tsjm], Theorem 3.1].
Finally, we verify assertion (iii). First, we observe that it follows from the
various deﬁnitions involved that there exists a commutative diagram

ﬁnite set. In particular, it follows immediately from our assumption that K is
TKND [i.e., the fact that Kdiv ⊆ K is an inﬁnite ﬁeld extension] that f is a
constant function such that κY (f ) = 0. Thus, we conclude that DY |Im(κY ) is
injective. This completes the proof of assertion (iii), hence of Lemma 6.7.

Theorem 6.8 (TKND-AVKF-ﬁelds satisfy the AA-property). Let K ⊆
Q be a TKND-AVKF-ﬁeld. Then the following hold:
(i) The closed subgroup GK ⊆ GT satisﬁes the AA-property [cf. Deﬁnition
5.12].
(ii) The natural homomorphism
CGT (GK ) → GQ
[cf. Corollary 6.5, (iii)] is injective.

87

Proof. First, we verify assertion (i). Since K is AVKF, it follows from Corollary
6.5 that the closed subgroup GK ⊆ GT satisﬁes the BC-property. Next, since K
is TKND, it follows immediately from the various deﬁnitions involved that the
closed subgroup GK ⊆ GT satisﬁes condition (i) of Deﬁnition 5.12. Moreover,
since K is TKND-AVKF, it follows immediately from Lemma 6.7, (i), (iii),
together with the various deﬁnitions involved, that the closed subgroup GK ⊆
GT satisﬁes condition (ii) of Deﬁnition 5.12. On the other hand, since K is
AVKF, it follows immediately from Lemma 6.7, (ii), together with the various
deﬁnitions involved, that the function ﬁelds of ﬁnite ramiﬁed Galois coverings
of P1Q [i.e., the projective line over Q] determine a family
{KΠ† ⊆ LΠ† }Π† ⊆Π
of subsets as in Deﬁnition 5.12, (iii). Finally, it follows immediately from the
various deﬁnitions involved that condition (iv) of Deﬁnition 5.12 holds. Thus,
we conclude that the closed subgroup GK ⊆ GT satisﬁes the AA-property. This
completes the proof of assertion (i). Assertion (ii) follows immediately from
assertion (i), together with Theorem 5.15, (iii). This completes the proof of
Theorem 6.8.
Remark 6.8.1. Theorem 6.8, (i), may be regarded as a generalization of Remark
5.12.1 [cf. Remark 6.6.2]. In this context, we observe that the proof of Theorem
6.8, (i), (ii), can be simpliﬁed considerably in the case where K is assumed to be
Kummer-faithful, in which case one may combine the techniques of [AbsTopIII],
Theorem 1.11, or [Hsh1], Theorem A, with the combinatorial approach to Belyi
cuspidalizations developed in §3 of the present paper.

Claim 6.9.A: The isomorphism σ̃Gal arises from an isomorphism Q →
Q that maps K ⊆ Q onto L ⊆ Q.
Indeed, [cf. the above commutative diagram] since the closed subgroups GK ⊆
GT and GL ⊆ GT satisfy the BC-property [cf. Corollary 6.5], the functorial
constructions of Corollary 4.5, together with the isomorphism of Corollary 6.5,
(i) [applied to GK and GL ], determine a commutative diagram

where the lower horizontal arrows are isomorphisms of ﬁelds. Thus, we obtain

Now it follows from Claim 6.9.A that we may assume without loss of generality that K = L ⊆ Q. Next, it follows from Theorem 6.8, (ii), together with
the various deﬁnitions involved, that
NGT (GK ) ⊆ CGT (GK ) ⊆ GQ .
In particular, we conclude that NGT (GK )/GK = NGQ (GK )/GK . Note that
since ΠXn is center-free [cf. [MT], Proposition 2.2, (ii)], there exists [cf. the
above commutative diagram] a natural isomorphism
∼

Out(Π(XK )n /GK ) → NOut(ΠXn ) (GK )/GK ,
where Out(Π(XK )n /GK ) denotes the set of outer automorphisms of Π(XK )n
that induce outer automorphisms of GK . In particular, σ ∈ Out(Π(XK )n /GK )
determines an element of
NOut(ΠXn ) (GK )/GK = NGT×Sn+3 (GK )/GK
= (NGT (GK )/GK ) × Sn+3

89

[cf. the ﬁrst display of [HMM], Corollary C]. Thus, in light of the natural
isomorphism
∼
Aut(K) → NGQ (GK )/GK = NGT (GK )/GK ,
we conclude that the natural group homomorphism
Aut((XK )n ) −→ Out(Π(XK )n /GK )
is surjective, and [by considering the various ﬁber subgroups of ΠXn and cuspidal inertia subgroups of ΠX ] that any element α ∈ Aut((XK )n ) in the kernel
of this group homomorphism is K-linear and compatible with the identity automorphism of XK relative to any of the n + 3 generalized projection morphisms
(XK )n → XK [cf. [HMM], Deﬁnition 2.1, (i)]. But this implies that any such
α is equal to the identity automorphism of (XK )n . This completes the proof of
Corollary 6.9.

Then the outer isomorphism

(ii) Suppose that

For each positive integer i, write
• Xi (respectively, Yi , Zi ) for the i-th conﬁguration space associated to X
(respectively, Y , Z).
Note that, to verify assertions (i), (ii), it follows immediately from the various
deﬁnitions involved that we may assume without loss of generality that
Out(Π(XK )m /GK , Π(YL )n /GL ) = ∅.
Thus, we conclude from [HMM], Theorem A, (i), that
m = n ≥ 2,

g X = gY ,

r X = rY .

Let σ ∈ Out(Π(XK )n /GK , Π(YL )n /GL );

an isomorphism that lifts σ. Write σQ : ΠXn → ΠYn for the outer isomorphism

commutative diagram determines an outer isomorphism Π(ZK )2 → Π(ZL )2 that
lies over σ̃Gal between the second conﬁguration spaces (ZK )2 , (ZL )2 associated
to ZK , ZL , respectively. Thus, we conclude from Corollary 6.9 that the outer
∼
isomorphism determined by σ̃Gal : GK → GL arises from a ﬁeld isomorphism
∼
K → L. This completes the proof of assertion (i).
Next, we verify assertion (ii). First, it follows from a similar argument to
the argument applied in the ﬁnal portion of the proof of Corollary 6.9 that the
natural map
Isom((XK )n , (YL )n ) −→ Out(Π(XK )n /GK , Π(YL )n /GL )
92

is injective. Thus, it suﬃces to prove that this map is surjective. Observe
that since ΠYn is slim [cf. [MT], Proposition 2.2, (ii)], it follows immediately
from [NodNon], Theorem C, (ii), that Π(YL )n is slim. In particular, it follows
immediately, by applying Galois descent, that we may assume without loss of
generality that every cusp of X (respectively, Y ) is K-rational (respectively,
L-rational). On the other hand, since gX = gY = 0, it suﬃces to consider the
case where rX = rY ≥ 4 [cf. Corollary 6.9].
Next, we verify the following assertion:
∼

Claim 6.10.A: There exists an isomorphism of schemes XK → YL .
Indeed, observe that it follows from Theorem 2.1 [cf. our assumption that
rX = rY ≥ 4] that there exist open immersions XK → ZK , YL → ZL over
K, L, respectively, which, together with σ̃, determine a ΠZn -outer isomorphism
∼
σZn : Π(ZK )n → Π(ZL )n that lies over the isomorphism σ̃Gal . Thus, by applying
Corollary 6.9, we may assume without loss of generality that
• K = L;
• σ̃Gal is the identity automorphism;
• σZn is the identity ΠZn -outer automorphism.
In particular, since σQ induces a bijection between the respective sets of ﬁber
subgroups and inertia subgroups [cf. Corollary 2.2; the discussion of [CbTpII],
∼
Remark 4.14.1], σ̃ determines a ΠY -outer isomorphism σ1 : ΠXK → ΠYK [cf.
[CbTpI], Theorem A, (i)] such that
• σ1 lies over GK ;
• σ1 induces a bijection between the respective sets of cuspidal inertia subgroups.
Thus, we conclude from the property (ISC) [cf. the proof of Corollary 6.4],
∼
applied to ZK , that there exists an isomorphism XK → YK over K. This
completes the proof of Claim 6.10.A.
In summary, it follows formally from Claim 6.10.A, together with the above
discussion, that we may assume without loss of generality that
• K = L, XK = YK ;
• σ̃ is an automorphism of Π(XK )n that lies over the identity automorphism
of GK ;
∼

• the ΠZn -outer automorphism σZn : Π(ZK )n → Π(ZK )n [induced by σ̃ and
the open immersion XK → ZK over K] is the identity ΠZn -outer automorphism;
∼

• the outer automorphism σQ : ΠXn → ΠXn [determined by σ̃] induces the
identity automorphism on the set of ﬁber subgroups;
93

∼

• the ΠX -outer automorphism σ1 : ΠXK → ΠXK [determined by σ̃] induces
the identity automorphism on the set of conjugacy classes of cuspidal inertia subgroups of ΠX [cf. the discussion above of the property (ISC) applied
to ZK ].
Thus, if we regard GK as a subgroup of OutgF (ΠXn )cusp via the natural injection GK → OutgF (ΠXn )cusp [cf. [NodNon], Theorem C, (ii)], then σQ ∈
ZOutgF (ΠXn )cusp (GK ). Write
β ∈ ZOutgF (ΠX2 )cusp (GK )
for the element determined by σQ via the natural injection OutgF (ΠXn )cusp →
OutgF (ΠX2 )cusp [cf. [NodNon], Theorem B];
h : OutgF (ΠX2 )cusp → OutgF (ΠZ2 )cusp
for the natural homomorphism induced by the natural open immersion X2 →
Z2 [cf. Theorem 2.1]. Then it follows immediately from our assumption that
∼
σZn : Π(ZK )n → Π(ZK )n is the identity ΠZn -outer automorphism that h(β) = 1.
Thus, we conclude from Theorem 3.6 [where we take “V ⊆ W ” to be the
open immersion X → Z in the above discussion], together with Corollary 6.4,
that β = 1, hence that σQ = 1. Finally, since ΠXn is center-free [cf. [MT],
Proposition 2.2, (ii)], it holds that σ̃ is an inner automorphism, hence that
σ = 1. Thus, we obtain the desired surjectivity. This completes the proof of
assertion (ii), hence of Theorem 6.10.

Remark 6.10.1. In the notation of Theorem 6.10, write
Out(Π(XK )m , Π(YL )n )
∼

for the set of outer isomorphisms Π(XK )m → Π(YL )n . Suppose that GK and GL
are very elastic [cf. [AbsTopI], Deﬁnition 1.1, (ii)]. Then since ΠXm and ΠYn
are topologically ﬁnitely generated [cf. [MT], Proposition 2.2, (ii)], it follows
formally that
Out(Π(XK )m , Π(YL )n ) = Out(Π(XK )m /GK , Π(YL )n /GL ),
i.e., that the “absolute version” of Theorem 6.10 holds.
Remark 6.10.2. In the notation of Theorem 6.10, suppose that K and L arise
as ﬁelds “L” of the sort discussed in Proposition 6.3, (i), (ii) [cf. Remark 6.6.3].
Suppose, further, that K and L are abelian extensions of number ﬁelds. Then
K and L are very elastic [cf. [FJ], Theorem 13.4.2; [FJ], Theorem 16.11.3; [Mi],
Theorem 2.1]. In particular, it follows immediately from Remark 6.10.1 that
the absolute version of Theorem 6.10 holds.
