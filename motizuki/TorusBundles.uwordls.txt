For
the
past
two
decades
a
large
part
of
the
research
in
the
topology
of
3-manifolds
has
been
done
under
the
hypothesis
that
the
manifolds
are
sufficiently-large,
that
is,
they
contain
properly
embedded,
incompressible
surfaces.
The
notion
of
incompressible
surface
was
introduced
by
W.
Haken
and
the
power
of
this
hypothesis
was
exhibited
in
the
work
of
F.
Waldhausen.
Until
recently,
the
only
known
examples
of
orientable,
irreducible
3-manifolds
that
are
not
sufficiently-large
were
certain
'small'
Seifert
fibred
spaces;
the
only
ones
with
infinite
fundamental
group
are
discussed
by
Waldhausen
in
[5].
However,
W.
Thurston
discovered
that
most
Dehn
surgeries
on
the
'figure-eight'
knot
in
S
3
result
in
orientable,
irreducible
3-manifolds
that
are
not
sufficiently-large
and
not
Seifert
fibred.
These
new
manifolds
have
infinite
fundamental
group
(in
fact,
they
are
hyperbolic).
This
work
has
been
extended
by
Hatcher
and
Thurston
to
all
2-bridge
knots
in
S
3
[3].
The
idea
is
quite
straightforward;
namely,
if
M
is
obtained
from
M
by
doing
Dehn
surgery
along
a
simple
closed
curve
k
in
M
and
M
contains
an
orientable,
incompressible
surface,
then
the
bounded
manifold
M'
=
M
—
u{k),
where
u(k)
is
an
open
tubular
neighbourhood
of
k,
contains
a
properly-embedded,
orientable,
incompressible
and
boundary-incompressible
surface.
The
problem
is,
therefore,
to
understand
the
incompressible
and
boundaryincompressible
surfaces
in
M'.
This
problem
is,
in
its
own
right,
extremely
important
to
the
understanding
of
the
structure
of
3-manifolds.
In
this
paper
we
classify,
up
to
isotopy,
the
orientable,
incompressible
and
boundary-incompressible
surfaces
in
3-manifolds
that
fibre
over
Sl
with
fibre
a
oncepunctured
torus.
(A
once-punctured
torus
is
a
compact
surface
of
genus
1
with
one
boundary
component.)
We
call
a
surface
in
M
essential
if
it
is
properly
embedded,
incompressible,
boundary-incompressible,
and
not
parallel
to
a
surface
in
dM.
In
this
particular
situation
a
properly
embedded,
incompressible
surface
is
essential
if
it
is
neither
a
boundary-parallel
torus
nor
a
boundary-parallel
annulus.
It
follows
from
the
classification
that
if
M
contains
no
essential
tori,
then
M
contains
only
finitely
many
(up
to
isotopy)
essential
surfaces.
So,
we
can
apply
this
knowledge
to
study
manifolds
obtained
by
Dehn
surgeries
on
a
section
of
a
torus
bundle
over
S1.
Here,
we
conclude
that
most
Dehn
surgeries
give
manifolds
that
have
no
incompressible
surfaces;
and
therefore,
these
manifolds
are
not
Haken
and
not
reducible.
We
exhibit
an
infinite
family
of
such
manifolds
that
are
irreducible,
not
Haken,
and
have
first
homology
with
Z
2
-rank
equal
to
3.
All
manifolds
obtained
by
Dehn
surgery
on
a
section
of
a
torus
bundle
over
S
1
have
Heegaard
genus
at
most
3.
Hence,
this
family
of
manifolds
has
Heegaard
genus
equal
to
3.
It
follows
that
they
are
not
Seifert
fibred
(and
not
Haken)
and
not
obtained
by
Dehn
surgery
on
a
2-bridge
knot,
since
the
Heegaard
genus
in
both
of
these
cases
is
at
most
2;
thus,
we
have
given
infinitely
many
new
examples
of
non-Haken
manifolds.
A
special
case
of
our
considerations
is
Dehn-surgery
on
the
'figure-eight'
knot
in
S
3
(the
complement
of
the
'figure-eight'
knot
fibres
over
S

with
genus
1
fibre).

AND
H.
RUBINSTEIN
give
two
new
pieces
of
information.
One
is
that
the
three-sheeted
cyclic
branched
covering
of
5
3
,
branched
over
the
'figure-eight'
knot
is
a
Haken
manifold;
and
another
is
that
while
neither
the
16
nor
—16
Dehn
surgeries
on
the
'figure-eight'
knot
are
Haken,
both
have
four-sheeted
cyclic
coverings
that
are
Haken.
Both
of
these
results
are
obtained
by
exhibiting
essential
surfaces
in
the
three-
and
four-sheeted
cyclic
coverings
of
the
'figure-eight'
knot
space
that
do
not
project,
under
the
covering
projection,
to
non-singular
surfaces.
In
§
1,
we
establish
some
of
the
preliminaries
and
the
notation
in
which
we
work.
In
§2,
we
construct
four
types
of
essential
surfaces
in
once-punctured
torus
bundles.
In
§
3,
we
prove
that
an
essential
surface
in
a
once-punctured
torus
bundle
is
isotopic
to
one
of
the
types
that
we
constructed
in
§2.
In
§§4
and
5,
we
study
the
isotopy
classification
of
these
essential
surfaces.
In
particular,
we
prove
that
there
are
only
finitely
many
isotopy
classes
of
surfaces
of
a
given
type
(and
we
completely
analyse
the
situation
in
which
there
is
more
than
one
isotopy
class
of
surfaces
of
the
same
type).
Also,
we
prove
that
in
each
bundle
there
are
only
finitely
many
types
of
surface,
except
in
the
case
that
the
bundle
contains
an
essential
torus.
However,
in
this
latter
case
we
describe
the
situation
completely.
In
§6,
we
give
a
number
of
examples.
Our
methods
enable
us
to
find
all
essential
surfaces
in
a
given
once-punctured
torus
bundle
M,
and
describe
the
boundary
curves
of
all
essential
surfaces
in
terms
of
a
single
coordinate
system
(framing)
on
dM.
We
present
the
required
algorithms
in
§6.
In
§7
we
raise
some
unanswered
questions
and
make
some
conjectures.
Any
notation
or
terminology
which
is
not
defined
here
is
defined
by
Jaco
in
[4].
We
remark
that
throughout
this
paper
we
will
be
working
in
the
differentiable
category.
We
will
assume,
without
explicitly
saying
so,
that
the
manifolds
under
consideration
are
orientable,
that
submanifolds
are
properly
embedded,
and
that
intersections
are
transverse.
The
case
when
the
once-punctured
torus
bundle
is
hyperbolic
has
been
independently
studied
by
W.
Floyd
and
A.
Hatcher,
using
the
techniques
of
[3].

We
note
that
the
homotopy

of
the

form
a
free
basis
for

Also,
the

is

homotopic
to

1.2.
The
homeotopy
group
of
T
The
homeotopy
group
of
a
manifold
M
is
the
group
Jf(M)
of
homeomorphisms
of
M
modulo
the
subgroup
of
homeomorphisms
that
are
isotopic
to
the
identity.
If
M
is
orientable,
we
denote
by
Jf+(M)
the
subgroup
of
isotopy
classes
of
orientationpreserving
homeomorphisms.
The
homeotopy
group
of
Tcan
be
identified
with
the
group
GL
2
(Z),
with
,
#

corresponding
to

respectively.

let

Then
the

induces
an
isomorphism
from

onto
Aut(Z

1.2.3.
The
homology

of

form
a
basis
for

We
may
use
this
basis
to
identify
Jf(T)
with
GL
2
(Z)
(of
course,
Jf+(T)
corresponds
to
SL
2
(Z)
cz
GL
2
(Z)).
Throughout
this
paper
we
will
use
this
identification:
isotopy
classes
of
homeomorphisms
of
Twill
be
denoted
by
2x2
integer
matrices
with
determinant
±
1.
Thus
the
isotopy
classes
of

and

correspond
to
the
matrices
A=

B=

respectively.

Let
P

be
the
two

These
two

generate

we
have

Finally,
observe
that

of
the

by

Bundles
over
Sl
with
fibre
T
Two
fibre
bundles
with
the
same
fibre
and
base
are
said
to
be
equivalent
if
there
is
a
fibre-preserving
homeomorphism
between
them
that
induces
the
identity
on
the
base.
They
are
weakly
equivalent
if
there
is
a
fibre-preserving
homeomorphism
between
them.
By
the
classification
of
fibre
bundles
over
spheres,
we
know
that
the
equivalence
classes
of
bundles
over
Sl
with
fibre
T
are
in
one-to-one
correspondence
with
conjugacy
classes
in
jf(T).
The
conjugacy
class
that
corresponds
to
a
bundle
is
called
its
characteristic
class.
Let
the
conjugacy
class
of
an
element
H
E
Jf{T)
be
denoted
by
[//].
Now
if
M
and
N
are
fibre
bundles
over
S
1
with
fibre
T
and
characteristic
classes
[//]
and
[G],
respectively,
then
M
and
N
are
weakly
equivalent
if
and
only
if
In
general
a
manifold
may
admit
fibrations
over
S1,
with
the
same
fibre,
which
are
not
weakly
equivalent.
However,
this
cannot
happen
if
the
fibre
is
a
once-punctured
torus.
1.3.1.
PROPOSITION
(Murasugi).
Let
M
and
N
be
orientable
3-manifolds
that
fibre
over
Sl
with
fibre
a
once-punctured
torus.
Then
M
is
homeomorphic
to
N
if
and
only
if
the
fibre
bundle
structures
on
M
and
N
are
weakly
equivalent.
Proof.
Clearly
M
and
iV
are
homeomorphic
if
the
bundles
are
weakly
equivalent.
Conversely,
suppose
that
M
and
N
are
homeomorphic.
Let
[//]
and
[G]
be
the
characteristic
classes
of
the
respective
bundles.
Observe
that
HX{M)
and
H{(N)
are
presented
with
three
generators
and
relation
matrices
(//-/|0)
and
(G
-
/10)
respectively.
Now
the
proof
breaks
into
two
cases.
Case
1.
If
trace(//)
#
2
then
it
is
easily
seen,
from
the
presentation
above,
that
the
free
subgroup
of
HX{M)
has
rank
1.
Of
course,
HX(N)
«
H^M),
so
H^N)
also
has
free
rank
1.
Thus
nx{M)
and
ny{N)
each
contain
only
one
subgroup
that
is
the
kernel
of
an
epimorphism
to
Z.
These
subgroups
must
be
the
images
of
the
inclusions
n^T)
-*•
n^M)
and
n^T)
-*•
n^N).
The
characteristic
classes
of
the
two
bundles
are
therefore
determined
by
the
actions,
by
conjugation,
of
n^M)
and
n^N)
on
n^T).
It
follows
that
[H]
=
[
G
1
1
]
.
Case
2.
In
the
case
that
trace(H)
=
2
=
trace(/C)
the
proof
is
based
on
a
fact
about
GL
2
(Z):
namely
that
each
conjugacy
class
of
trace
2
in
GL2(Z)
contains
exactly
one
element
of
the
form
1,
where
If
H
is
conjugate
to
(
],
tKen
we
see
from
the
presentation
of
H^M)
that
n
is
the
ONCE-PUNCTURED
TORUS
BUNDLES
order
of
the
torsion
subgroup
of
HX{M)
«
H{(N).
Thus
G
is
also
conjugate
to.

Constructing

let

for
i
=

and
let

F

be

Define
XJnX2
to
be
the
quotient
space
obtained
from
Xv
u
X2
by
identifying
y,(x,

to
y2(ti(x),0).
Define
X

,
,
to
be
the
quotient
space
obtained
from
X{
by
identifying
y{(x,

to

If
y,:

->
X,
and
»/,-:
F
-»
F
are
homeomorphisms
for
i
=
1,...,
n,
then
is
well-defined.
This
space
clearly
fibres
over

and
characteristic
class

where

denotes
the

of

The
spaces
X,-,
for
i
=
1,...,
n,
will
be
called
blocks
in
AT.
We
will
construct
bundles
over
S
\
with
fibre
T,
in
this
way,
using
homeomorphisms
r/,-
which
are
powers
of
a
or
/?.
To
construct
surfaces
in
these
bundles
we
will
embed
surfaces
in
each
block
so
that,
after
identification
of
the
blocks,
the
surfaces
fit
together
to
give
a
properly
embedded
surface
in
the
bundle.
1.5.
Essential
surfaces
We
remark
that
in
a
3-manifold,
all
of
whose
boundary
components
are
tori,
an
incompressible,
boundary-compressible
surface
must
be
a
boundary-parallel
annulus.
To
see
this,
perform
a
surgery
along
a
boundary-compressing
disk
and
observe
that
the
resulting
surface
must
have
a
boundary
component
that
bounds
a
disk
on
dM.
The
new
surface
is
incompressible
and
hence
must
be
a
boundary-parallel
disk.
This
implies
that
the
original
surface
was
a
boundary-parallel
annulus.
It
is
a
corollary
of
this
observation
that
any
incompressible
surface
in
a
oncepunctured
torus
bundle
over
S1,
which
is
not
boundary
parallel,
is
an
essential
surface.
2.
Examples
We
will
describe
a
number
of
surfaces
in
once-punctured
torus
bundles
and
prove
that
they
are
essential.
In
the
following
section
we
will
show
that,
up
to
isotopy,
any
essential
surface
in
a
once-punctured
torus
bundle
is
of
the
same
type
as
one
of
those
described
here.
To
describe
these
surfaces
we
will
first
compile
a
list
of
surfaces
embedded
in
T
x
/.
We
will
then
consider
bundles
of
the
form
where
each
block
contains
one
of
the
surfaces
in
our
list.
The
surfaces
and
maps
rj;
will
be
such
that
after
identification
we
obtain
a
properly
embedded,
connected
surface
in
the
bundle.
Sometimes
the
surface
constructed
this
way
will
be
non-orientable.
In
this
case
we
will
consider,
instead,
the
orientable
surface
that
is
the
boundary
of
a
regular

of
the
non-orientable

If
S
a
M

is
a
properly
embedded,
nonorientable
surface
then
we
will
use
the
notation
S
to
denote
the
boundary
of
a
regular
neighbourhood
of
S.

with

We

If
each

then
these

a

properly

with

(Connectedness
is
equivalent
to
the
condition
(p,

=

We
will
call
this
the
spun
surface,
S(p,
q,n).
A

of

in

One
could
carry
out
the
construction
above
using
q>2a."

place
of

It
is
easily
checked
that
the
resulting
(non-orientable)
surface
is
compressible
unless
p
=

If
p
=
1
and
q
=

then
we
obtain
a
once-punctured
Klein
bottle,
which
is
necessarily
incompressible.
However,
the
boundary
of
its
regular
neighbourhood,
a
twicepunctured
torus,
is
compressible.
2.4.1.
PROPOSITION.
The
surface
S(p,q,n)
is
essential
in
the
once-punctured
torus
bundle
with
characteristic
class
[a
n
]
for
all
p,
q
with
p

and
(p,

—

Proof.
Let
M
be
the
infinite
cyclic
cover
of
M,
and
let
S(p,
q,
n)
be
the
inverse
image
of
S(p,q,n)
under
the
covering
projection.
It
suffices
to
show
that
§(p,q,n)
is
incompressible
in
M,
for
this
implies
that
5(p,
q,
n)
is
incompressible
in
M.
Since
S(p,
q,
n)
is
clearly
not
boundary
parallel,
it
is
therefore
essential.
If
M
is
identified
with
TxU

then

Then

Let

contain

if

After
identification
these
surfaces
fit
together
to
give
a
properly

connected
surface
R.
Notice
that
R
is
orientable
if
k
is

and
R
is
non-orientable
if
k

We
define
the

Let
J,n(l),...,n{k),
and
M
be

The

is
essential
in
M
if
and
only
if\
n(i)\
$s

for
i
=
1,...,
k.
Proof.
Let
M
be
the
cyclic
cover,
corresponding
to
the
fibre,
of
the
bundle
M
=
TxI/anluTxI/pnt2)...TxI/(l)J
and
let
S
<=
M
be
a
component
of
the
inverse
image
of
C{J;
n(k),...,n(\))
c
M
under
the
covering
projection.
Clearly
it
suffices
to
show
that
S
is
incompressible
in
M.
We
note
that
M
is
divided
into
blocks,
which
are
inverse
images
of
the
blocks
in
the
bundle,
and
that
each
block
in
M
meets
S
in
one
disk,
which
is
embedded
as
in
Fig.
4.
Let
F
be
the
union
of
the
fibres
along
which
the
blocks
in
M
are
joined.
To
prove
the
proposition
we
will
consider
the
family
of
all
compressing
or
boundary-compressing
disks
for
S
in
M.
If
this
family
is
non-empty
then
there
exists
a
member
D
for
which
Dn
F
has
the
minimal
number
of
components.
We
will
analyse
the
ways
that
this
minimal
disk
can
meet
the
blocks
in
M,
and
conclude
that
such
a
disk
exists
if
and
only
if
\n(i)\
<
2
for
some
i=
\,...,k.
Let
X
be
a
block
of
M
with
D
n
X
#

.
If
we
cut
X
along
the
disk
X
r\S,
then
we
obtain
two
solid
tori
as
shown
in
Fig.
6.
In
order
to
see
how
D
meets
X,
we
shall
consider
how
D
meets
these
tori.
SnX
SnX
FIG.

Consider
one
of
the
solid
tori
that
has
non-empty
intersection
with
D.
Its
boundary
meets
S
in
one
disk,
meets
dM
in
two
disks
(labelled
B),
and
meets
F
in
a
disk,
Fd,
and
an
annulus,
Fa.
These
subsets
of
the
torus
are
shown
in
Fig.
6.
We
will
prove
that
D
n
Fd
=
0.
In
particular,
it
will
follow
that
DnX
is
contained
in
only
one
of
these
two
solid
tori.
First,
observe
that
there
cannot
be
any
simple
closed
curve
components
of
F
n
D
at
all.
For
if
there
is
a
simple
closed
curve
component
of
F
n
D,
then
there
is
one,
say
o\
that
is
'innermost'
on
D;
that
is,
a'
bounds
a
disk
D'
c
F
and
D'
n
F
=
a'.
Now,
D'
is
a
disk
in
M
and
D'
n
F
=
dD'.
However,
F
is
incompressible,
so
3D'
also
bounds
a
disk
in
F.
Using
standard
techniques
we
may
replace
D
by
a
disk
which
meets
F
fewer
ONCE-PUNCTURED
TORUS

395
times
but
has
the
same
boundary.
Thus,
we
arrive
at
a
contradiction
to
the
minimality
assumption
for
D.
So,
suppose
that
a
is
an
arc
component
of
D
n
Fd.
There
are
four
possibilities
for
such
an
arc.
(1)
Both
end
points
of
a
are
contained
in
B.
If
this
is
the
situation,
then
D
must
be
a
boundary
compression;
and
the
arc
or
is
a
spanning
arc
of
D
with
both
end
points
in
3M.
Among
all
the
components
of
D
n
Fd
that
are
spanning
arcs
in
D
with
both
of
their
end
points
in
3M,
consider
one,
say
a',
that
is
'outermost'
on
D;
that
is,
there
is
a
disk
D
'
c
D
with
3D'
consisting
of
two
arcs
a'
and
3',
where
3'
c
3D
and
D'
nFd
=
a'.
Also,
3'adM.
The
disk
D'
a
M
has
3D'
=
a'u
3'
with
a'
=
D'
n
Fd
and
3'
—
D'
ndM.
However,
F
is
boundary-incompressible,
and
3M
is
incompressible.
Therefore,
by
standard
techniques
we
may
construct
a
boundary-compressing
disk
which
meets
S
in
the
same
arc
as
D,
but
meets
F
in
fewer
components
than
D.
This
contradicts
the
minimality
assumption
on
D.
(2)
Both
end
points
of
a
are
in
the
same
component
of
S
n
Fd.
Here,
the
arc
a
is
a
spanning
arc
of
D
with
both
end
points
in
S.
Among
all
the
components
of
D
n
Fd
that
have
both
end
points
in
the
same
component
of
S
o
Fd,
choose
one,
say
a',
that
is
'outermost'
on
Fd;
that
is,
there
is
a
disk
A
e
Fd,
and
dA
consists
of
two
arcs,
a'
and
3',
with
3'
c
Sn
Fd
and
A
n
D
=
a'.
Now,
perform
a
surgery
of
D
along
A.
The
result
is
two
disks
each
of
which
meets
F
in
fewer
components
than
D.
Moreover,
at
least
one
of
these
disks
must
be
either
a
non-trivial
compressing
disk
for
S
or
a
non-trivial
boundary-compressing
disk
for
S.
In
either
case
we
contradict
the
minimality
assumption
for
D.
(3)
One
end
point
of
a
is
contained
in
B
and
one
is
contained
in
S.
Again,
D
must
be
a
boundary
compression,
and
the
arc
a
is
a
spanning
arc
of
D
with
one
end
point
in
3M
and
one
end
point
in
S.
Since
neither
situation
(1)
nor
situation
(2)
can
occur,
it
is
possible
to
choose
among
all
the
arc
components
of
D
n
Fd
with
one
end
point
in
B
and
one
end
point
in
S
one,
say
a'',
that
is
'outermost'
on
Fd;
that
is,
there
is
a
disk
A
cz
Fd
such
that
3A
is
the
union
of
three
consecutive
arcs
a',
s'
c
S,
and
3'
a
B,
and
A
n
D
=
a'.
Now
perform
a
surgery
of
D
along
A.
The
result
is
two
disks,
each
of
which
meets
F
in
fewer
components
than
D.
And,
since
s'
c
S
and
3'
c
3M,
at
least
one
of
these
two
disks
is
a
non-trivial
boundary
compression
for
D.
Again,
this
contradicts
the
minimality
assumption
for
D.
(4)
One
end
point
of
a
is
contained
in
one
component
of
S
n
Fd
and
one
is
contained
in
another
component
of
S
n
Fd.
The
arc
a
is
a
spanning
arc
of
D
with
both
end
points
in
S;
and
the
arc
a
is
a
spanning
arc
of
Fd
and
is
parallel
in
Fd
into
an
arc
component
of
Fd
n
B.
Since
none
of
the
possibilities
(1),
(2),
or
(3)
can
occur,
among
all
the
components
of
D
n
Fd
there
is
one,
say
a',
that
is
'outermost'
on
Fd\
that
is,
there
is
a
disk
A
c
Fd,
5A
is
the
union
of
four
consecutive
arcs
a',
s
c=
S,
3'
<=
B,
and
s'
a
S,
and
A
n
D
=
o'.
Perform
a
surgery
of
D
along
A.
In
this
situation,
two
disks
result,
each
of
which
meets
F
in
fewer
components
than
D.
However,
there
is
only
one
of
these
two
disks
that
is
a
candidate
for
a
compressing
or
boundary-compressing
disk
of
S;
its
boundary
is
the
union
of
two
arcs,
one
in
S
and
one
in
3M.
Denote
this
disk
by
D'.
Now,
since
the
end
points
of
a'
are
in
different
components
of
Fdr\
S,
the
arc
in
3D'
that
is
also
in
3M
runs
between
different
components
of
3S\
the
disk
D'
must
be
a
non-trivial
boundary-compressing
disk
for
S.
This
contradicts
the
minimality
assumption
for
D.
In
each
possible
situation
we
have
arrived
at
a
contradiction.
We
conclude
that
DnFd
=

Let
X'
denote
the
block

that
meets
the

X
along
the

containing
Fa.
Now,
X'
splits
along
S
into
two
solid
tori
just
as
X
did;
furthermore,
the
same
argument
as

applies
to
X'.
Hence
D

actually
contained

the

two

one

If

that

is
compressible
in

Summary
We
have
given
four
different
methods
of
constructing
once-punctured
torus
bundles
which
contain
essential
surfaces
other
than
the
fibre.
Next
we
will
show
that
any

essential
surface
in
a
once-punctured
torus
bundle
can
be
constructed
by
one
of
these
methods.
This
statement
can
be
made
more
precise
by
means
of
the
following
definition.
If
S
and
S'
are
surfaces
contained,
respectively,
in
the
once-punctured
torus
bundles
M
and
M',
then
we
will
say
that
S
and
S'
are
of
the
same
type
if
there
is
a
bundle
equivalence
from
M
to
M'
that
maps
S
to
S'.
In
the
next
section
we
will
show
that
any
essential
surface
in
a
once-punctured
torus
bundle
is
of
the
same
type
as
Im(D,)
or
(Im(D,)f
from
§2.2,
Im(£)
or
(Im(£)f
from
§2.3,
S{p,q,ri)

§2.4,
or

from
§2.5.

General
position
Throughout
this
section
we
will
let
M
be
a
once-punctured
torus
bundle
over
S
1
,
and
S
an
essential
surface
in
M.
We
will
say
that
S
is
in
general
position
provided
that
(1)
each
component
of
dS
either
is
contained
in
a
fibre
or
is
transverse
to
every
fibre,
(2)
the
projection
of
p:
M
-*•
Sl
restricts
to
a
morse
function
on
the
interior
of
S
having
distinct
critical
values,
(3)
among
all
surfaces
isotopic
to
S
and
satisfying
(1)
and
(2),
S
has
the
minimal
number
of
index
0
or
2
critical
points.
The
usual
considerations
show
that
S
can
be
moved
by
an
isotopy
so
that
it
is
in
general
position.
We
will
assume
from
now
on
that
this
has
been
done.
The
level
sets
of
p\s
are,
of
course,
the
intersections
of
S
with
the
fibres
of
M.
By
level
arcs
and
level
curves
we
mean
the
components
of
non-critical
level
sets.
3.1.
Level
arcs
3.1.1.
LEMMA.
Each
level
arc
of
S
is
essential
in
the
fibre
containing
it.
Proof.
Since
S
is
boundary-incompressible
it
suffices
to
show
that
each
level
arc
is
essential
in
S.
This
follows
from
Condition
(1)
above.
3.2.
Upper
and
lower
level
sets
Let
x
be
a
critical
point
of
p
|
s
with
p(x)
=
t,
and
let
/
be
the
largest
interval
containing
t
so
that
there
are
no
critical
values
other
than
t
in
/.
Let
X
be
the
component
of
S
n
p~
'(/)
that
contains
.v.
We
will
call
this
the
critical
neighbourhood
of
x.
For
small
e,
X
meets
the
fibres
p~1(t
+
e)
and
p~l(t
—
e)
in
1-manifolds
having
at
most
two
components.
The
projections
(via
the
local
product
structure)
of
these
1manifolds
onto
the
fibre
p~l(t)
will
be
called,
respectively,
the
upper
and
lower
level
sets
of
x.
(They
are
well-defined
up
to
isotopy.)
If
x
is
an
index
0
or
2
critical
point
then
one
of
the
upper
and
lower
level
sets
is
a
contractible
closed
curve
and
the
other
is
empty.
If
x
is
an
index
1
critical
point
then
the
upper
level
set
for
x
is
obtained
(up
to
isotopy)
from
the
lower
level
set
by
taking
a
band
sum
in
the
fibre
p~l(t).
See
Fig.
9.
Thus,
given
the
lower
level
set
for
an
index
1
critical
point,
the
possibilities
for
the
upper
level
set
correspond
to
the
isotopy
classes
of
arcs
in
the
fibre
which
are
disjoint
from
S
and
have
end
points
in
the
lower
level
set.

Either
S
meets
every
non-critical
fibre
only
in
arcs
or
S
meets
every
noncritical
fibre
only
in
simple
closed
curves.
Proof.
Since
S
is
connected
it
suffices
to
show
that
the
upper
and
lower
level
sets
of
each
critical
point
consist
entirely
of
arcs
or
entirely
of
simple
closed
curves.
By
symmetry
we
need
consider
only
the
lower
level
sets.
Suppose
that
the
lower
level
set
of
the
critical
point
x
consists
of
an
arc
and
a
simple
closed
curve.
There
are
two
cases
depending
on
whether
the
closed
curve
is
essential.
If
the
curve
is
essential
then,
since
the
fibre
split
along
the
arc
is
an
annulus,
the
isotopy
class
of
the
curve
is
determined.
The
upper
and
lower
level
sets
of
x
must
appear
as
in
Fig.
10.
In
particular,
the
upper
level
set
of
x
is
a
boundary-parallel
arc,
which
contradicts

ONCE-PUNCTURED

If
the
simple
closed
curve
component
of
the
lower
level
set
of
x
bounds
a
disk
in
the
fibre
p~
l{t)
then
the
level
sets
of
x
appear
as
in
Fig.
11.
Since
S
is
incompressible,
the
curve
component
of
Sr\p~\t
—
e),
for
small
s
>
0,
must
bound
a
disk
on
S.
This
disk
must
contain
at
least
one
index
0
critical
point.
However,
there
is
an
isotopy
that
cancels
x
and
the
index
0
critical
points
in
the
disk
without
introducing
new
critical
points.
This
contradicts
the
minimality
of
the
number
of
index
0
or
2
critical
points
on
S.
A
careful
construction
of
this
isotopy
can
be
made
by
using
the
observation
that
a
level-preserving
isotopy
cannot
introduce
new
critical
points.

As
a
corollary
of
this
lemma
we
see
that
if
the
intersection
of
S
with
any
fibre
contains
an
arc
then
there
are
no
index
0
or
2
critical
points.
This
will
happen,
except
when
each
boundary
component
of
S
is
contained
in
a
fibre.
With
patience
one
may
catalogue
all
of
the
possibilities
for
the
upper
and
lower
level
sets
of
an
index
1
critical
point
on
S.
Because
the
level
sets
of
S
consist
either
entirely
of
simple
closed
curves
or
entirely
of
essential
arcs,
there
are
twelve
possibilities
for
the
lower
level
set
of
x.
These
depend
on
whether
it
has
one
or
two
components
and
whether
these
components
are
contractible
closed
curves,
boundaryparallel
closed
curves,
essential
closed
curves,
or
essential
arcs.
Also,
if
there
are
two
arc
components,
either
these
will
be
parallel
or
their
complement
will
be
a
disk.
For
each
of
the
possible
lower
level
sets
one
constructs
the
possible
upper
level
sets
by
taking
band
sums
and
eliminating
those
that
contain
boundary-parallel
arcs
or
have
both
simple
closed
curves
and
arc
components.
Finally,
one
eliminates
the
case
when
the
lower
level
set
consists
of
one
arc
and
the
upper
level
set
is
obtained
by
a
band
sum
joining
opposite
sides
of
the
arc.
(See
Fig.
12.)
This
case
cannot
occur
because
the
surface
S
is
orientable.
We
invite
the
reader
to
construct
this
catalogue.
Having
done
so
it
will
be
easy
to
verify
the
following
two
facts.

Isotopy

of
essential
surfaces
3.3.1.
THEOREM.
An
essential
surface
in
a
once-punctured
torus
bundle
over
Sl
is
isotopic
either
to
the
fibre
or
to
a
surface
having
the
same
type
as
one
of
those
given
in
§§2.2,
2.3,
2.4,
or
2.5.
Proof.
We
move
S
by
an
isotopy
so
that
S
is
in
general
position.
By
Lemma
3.2.1
either
S
meets
every
non-critical
fibre
only
in
arcs
or
S
meets
every
non-critical
fibre
only
in
simple
closed
curves.
We
consider
these
two
cases
separately.
Case
1:
S
meets
every
non-critical
fibre
only
in
simple
closed
curves.
Suppose
that,
for
some
non-critical
fibre
F,
none
of
the
simple
closed
curve
components
of
S
n
F
is
essential
in
F
(a
simple
closed
curve
is
essential
in
a
surface
if
it
is
not
contractible
and
not
parallel
into
the
boundary).
We
can
assume,
possibly
after
an
isotopy
of
S
(we
do
not
need
to
keep
general
position
here,
even
though
it
could
be
maintained),
not
only
that
each
component
of
S
n
F
is
a
simple
closed
curve
that
is
not
essential
but
that,
within
the
isotopy
class
of
S,
the
number
of
such
curves
is
minimal.
It
follows
that
either
S
n
F
=
0
or
each
component
of
S
n
F
is
parallel
into
dF.
Now,
split
M
at
F
to
obtain
a
product
T
x
/
(T
is
a
once-punctured
torus).
Let
S'
be
the
result
of
splitting
S
at
S
n
F
.
The
surface
S'
is
incompressible
in
Txl.
Each
component
of
dS'
is
contained
in
dTx
I,
Tx
{0},
or
Tx
{1}
and
in
the
latter
two
cases
such
components
of
55'
are
parallel
into
dT.
It
follows
from
[2,
§8,
Appendix]
that
a
component
of
S'
is
either
an
annulus
or
a
once-punctured
torus.
Now,
by
considering
the
placement
of
the
boundary
of
such
an
annulus
or
once-punctured
torus,
we
see
that
the
above
minimality
condition
for
the
number
of
components
of
S
n
F
leaves
precisely
two
possibilities.
Either
SnF
has
one
component
and
S'
is
an
annulus
parallel
into
dTx
I
or
Sn
F
=
0
and
S'
is
parallel
in
Tx
I
to
T
x
{0}.
Hence,
5
is
either
a
torus
and
is
parallel
into
dM
(S
is
not
essential)
or
S
is
parallel
to
a
fibre.
So,
suppose
that
every
non-critical
fibre
F
contains
an
essential
simple
closed
curve
component
of
S
n
F.
In
this
situation
observe
that
for
F
a
non-critical
fibre,
the
components
of
5
n
F
consist
of
one
(non-empty)
family
of
parallel,
essential
simple
closed
curves,
a
(possibly
empty)
family
of
simple
closed
curves
each
parallel
into
dF,
and
a
(possibly
empty)
family
of
simple
closed
curves
each
contractible
in
F.
We
shall
show
that
in
a
critical
fibre
the
essential
closed
curves
of
the
upper
level
set
are
isotopic
in
the
fibre
to
those
of
the
lower
level
set.
Let
x
be
a
critical
point
with
p(x)
=
t
and
let
X
be
the
critical
neighbourhood
of
x.
Suppose
that,
for
small
e
>
0,
S
n
p~
l{t
—
e)
contains
an
essential
closed
curve
s
that
is
not
contained
in
X.
Then
the
component
of
S
n
p~l{[t
—
e,
t
+
e\)
containing
s
has
no
critical
points
and
hence
is
an
annulus.
Therefore
S
meets
the
fibre
p
~
l(t
+
e)
in
a
curve
isotopic
to
s.
By
symmetry
we
may
therefore
assume
that
all
essential
curves
of
p~l(t
—
e)n
S
and
p~l(t
+
£)r\S
are
contained
in
X.
Now,
it
follows
from
observation
3.2.2
that
the
essential
curves
in
the
two
fibres
are
isotopic.
By
our
assumption
that
every
non-critical
fibre
F
contains
an
essential
simple
closed
curve
component
of
S
n
F,
we
have
established
our
claim
that,
in
a
critical
fibre,
the
essential
closed
curves
in
the
upper
level
set
are
isotopic
to
those
in
the
lower
level
set.
So,
in
particular,
we
know
that
the
characteristic
class
of
M
fixes
the
isotopy
class
of
an
essential
curve,
and
hence
has
trace
±2.
Let
F
be
a
non-critical
fibre;
we
can
assume,
possibly
after
an
isotopy
of
the
essential
simple
closed
curves
of
S
at
a
non-critical
fibre,
that
SnF
does
not
contain
any
contractible
simple
closed
curves
and
that
relative
to
all
the
preceding
conditions
SnF
has
a
minimal
number
of
components.

Let

We
may
assume
that,
among
all
such

the
number
of

is
a
minimum.
In
particular,
it
follows
that
either

each

is
a
non-contractible

Let

we
have
that
a

either
an

We
again
consider
the
placement
of

Using
the

the

or

the

of
one
of
the

of
§
2.4.
This
completes
Case
1.
Case
2:
S
meets
every
non-critical
fibre
only
in
essential
arcs.
Notice
that
a
oncepunctured
torus
Thas
the
property
that
the
maximum
number
of
pairwise
disjoint,
non-parallel
essential
arcs
in
Tis
three.
If
a
non-critical
fibre
F
contains
three
essential
level
arcs,
no
two
of
which
are
parallel,
it
is
easy
to
check
that
there
are
no
critical
levels.
Split
M
at
a
non-critical
fibre
F
to
obtain
the
product
T
x
/
and
let
S'
be
S
split
at
F
r\S.
Then
each
component
of
S'
is
a
vertical
disk
in
T
x
/
meeting
each
level
in
three
distinct
families
of
parallel,
essential
arcs.
By
connectivity
(and
orientability)
considerations,
either
S
has
six
vertical
disks
in
T
x
/
and
S
is
an
annulus
of
type
(Im(D3))
,
coming
from
a
bundle

or
S'
has

disks
in
T
x
/
and
S
is
an
annulus
of
type
Im(D3),
coming
from
a
bundle
with
characteristic
class
[@2].
We
can
now
assume
that
S
meets
each
non-critical
fibre
in
at
most
two
parallel
families
of
arcs.
Next
we
need
an
observation
that
uses
the
incompressibility
of
S.
Suppose
that
F
is
a
non-critical
fibre
that
meets
S
in
two
parallel
families
of
arcs.
Let
x
be
the
critical
point
immediately
below
F
and
y
the
critical
point
immediately
above.
Let
X
and
Y
be
the
respective
critical
neighbourhoods
of
x
and
y.
Recall
that
the
upper
and
lower
level
sets
of
a
critical
point
each
consist
of
two
parallel
arcs,
and
that
the
upper
level
set
is
obtained
by
a
band
sum
across
the
annulus
component
of
the
complement
of
the
lower
level
set.
This
means
that
X
and
Ymeet
F
in
arcs
that
are
'outermost'
in
their
parallel
family
(i.e.
the
parallel
family
is
contained
in
the
disk
component
of
the
complement
of
these
arcs).
We
observe
that
the
arcs
X
n
F
are
not
in
the
same
parallel
family
as
Yn
F.
That
is
to
say
that
the
sequence
of
level
sets
shown
in
Fig.
16
cannot
occur.
FIG.
16
To
see
this,
notice
that,
since
X
n
F
and
Yn
F
are
outermost,
if
they
were
contained
in
the
same
family
then
they
would
be
equal.
Thus
X
u
Y
would
be
an
annulus
contained
in
S
that
is
contained
in
a
3-cell
in
M.
This
is
impossible
since
S
is
incompressible.
(The
compression
that
would
result
is
analogous
to
that
shown
in
Fig.
8.)
Now
we
claim
that
either
S
meets
some
fibre
in
a
single
parallel
family
of
arcs,
or
S
is
a
surface
of
the
same
type
as
the
annulus
(Im(D2))
.
For
the
proof
of
this
claim
suppose
that
S
meets
every
non-critical
fibre
in
two
parallel
families
of
arcs.
One
of
these
families
is
distinguished
in
each
fibre
by
the
fact
that
its
outermost
arcs
are
contained
in
the
critical
neighbourhood
of
the
critical
point
immediately
above
the
fibre.
Let
A'
be
a
critical
point
with
p(x)
=
t.
The
preceding
observation
shows
that
for
small
£
>
0,
the
distinguished
family
of
arcs
in
p~x{t
+
£)
contains
two
fewer
arcs
than
the
distinguished
family
in
p~l(t
—
e).
This
implies
that
there
are
no
critical
points
in
S,
for
otherwise
it
would
follow
by
induction
that
the
distinguished
family
of
arcs
in
F
contains
fewer
arcs
than
itself.
An
easy
combinatorial
argument
now
shows
that,
since
S
is
connected,
there
are
exactly
two
arcs
in
each
parallel
family
in
S
n
F.
Therefore
S
is
of
the
same
type
as
(Im(D2))~.
Finally,
suppose
that
S
meets
the
fibre
F
in
one
family
of
parallel
arcs.
If
S
contains
no
critical
points,
then
another
easy
combinatorial
argument
shows
that
there
are
at
most
two
arcs
in
the
family.
It
follows
that
the
characteristic
class
of
M
has
trace
2
and
hence
that
S
has
the
type
of
(Im(D,))
in
Tx
I/^i,
or
of
(Im(Dj))
in
T
x
//,p2Oan,
or
of
Im(D,)
in
Txl/a,,.
If
S
does
contain
a
critical
point,
we
consider
the
product
M'
obtained
by
splitting
M
along
F.
Let
S'
a
M'
be
S
split
along
S
n
F.
The
earlier
observation
then
implies,
by
another
combinatorial
argument,
that
each
component
of
S'
meets
each
noncritical
fibre
in
exactly
two
arcs.
Therefore,
in
order
for
S
to
be
connected,
there
must

Isotopy
A
given
once-punctured
torus
bundle
may
contain
several
of
the
essential
surfaces
of
the
types
that
we
have
described.
We
now
determine
which
of
these
are
in
the
same
isotopy
class.
If
M
is
a
fibre
bundle,
an
isotopy
of
M
which
is
a
bundle
equivalence
at
each
time
will
be
called
a
bundle
isotopy.
4.1.
Isotopies

4.1.1.
PROPOSITION.
Let
M
be
a
once-punctured
torus
bundle
containing
surfaces
S
and
S'
of
types
C{J
;n{k),...,n(\))
and
C(J;
m(/c),...,m(l)),
respectively.
If
the
k-tuple
(m(k),...,m(\))
is
obtained
from
(n(k),...,n(\))
by
a
cyclic
permutation,
then
there
is
a
bundle
equivalence
h:
M
-*•
M
so
that
S
is
isotopic
to
h(S').
Proof.
The
surface
S'
can
be
moved
by
a
bundle
isotopy
so
that
both
S
and
S'
are
divided
into
twisted
saddles
by
the
fibres
F0,...,Fk_i
and
so
that
for
any
i
G
{0,...,
k—
1}
each
surface
twists
the
same
number
of
times
in
the
block
between
F,
and
F,-
+
1(modk)
.
Thus
we
can
assume
that
m(i)
=
n(i),
for
/
=
l,...,/c.
The
isotopy
classes
in
F,
of
the
arcs
S
n
F,
and
S'
n
F,
are
completely
determined
by
the
respective
isotopy
classes
of
S
n
F
o
and
S'
n
F
o
.
While
S
n
F
o
may
not
be
isotopic
to
S'nF0,
there
is
a
homeomorphism
n:
Fo
-*
F
o
with
n(S'
n
Fo)
=
S
n
F
o
.
Let
H
e
SL2(Z)
be
the
isotopy
class
of
n.
Then
it
follows
from
the
definition
of
n
that
H
commutes
with
PJ...
S"(2)/4"(1).
Therefore
n
can
be
extended
to
a
bundle
equivalence
h:
M
-*
M.
Both
S
and
h(S')
are
divided
into
twisted
saddles
by
F
o
,...,
Fk_
j
and
they
meet
each
F,
in
isotopic
families
of
arcs.
Thus
S
is
isotopic
to
h(S')
by
a
bundle
isotopy
of
M.
4.1.2.
REMARK.
Suppose
that
X
and
Yare
commuting
elements
in
a
free
product
with
amalgamation
in
which
the
amalgamating
subgroup
is
central
in
each
factor.
Then
X
and
Yare
both
contained
in
a
cyclic
subgroup,
or
X
and
Yare
both
contained
in
a
factor,
or
one
of
X
or
Yis
contained
in
the
amalgamating
subgroup.
In
the
notation
of
the
proof
of
Proposition
4.1.1,
this
implies
that
either
H
=
P2
or
H
and
PJ...
B"{2)A"{1)
are
contained
in
a
cyclic
subgroup.
Thus,
under
the
hypotheses
of
Proposition
4.1.1,
if
the
characteristic
class
of
the
bundle
M
is
not
a
proper
power,
then
S
is
isotopic
to
S'.
In
general,
if
M
has
characteristic
class
[G
s
],
where
G
is
not
a
proper
power,
then
there
are
at
most
s—
1
bundle
equivalences
mapping
S
to
a
surface
that
is
not
isotopic
to
S.
These
bundle
equivalences
are
extensions
of
homeomorphisms
of
the
fibre
in
the

classes
G,

respectively.
If
S

are

then
there
is
a
bundle

taking
S
to

Moreover,
k

and
(m{k),...,m(\))

Proof.
Since
S
and
S'
are
homeomorphic
surfaces,
an
euler
characteristic
computation
shows
that
k
must
equal
k'.
Once
we
have
shown
that
S
and
S'
are
bundle
isotopic
it
is
immediate
that
(m(k),...,m{\))
is
a
cyclic
permutation
of
(/i(/c),
...,n(l)).
It
also
follows
that
J
=
J',
since
P2X
is
not
conjugate
to
X
in
SL2(Z).
Thus
we
need
show
only
that
S
and
S'
are
bundle
isotopic.
If
P
e
{1,
—
1}
then
S
and
S'
are
boundaries
of
regular
neighbourhoods
of
nonorientable
surfaces.
It
suffices
to
show
that
these
non-orientable
surfaces
are
bundle
isotopic.
Thus
we
will
assume
in
this
case
that
S
and
S'
have
been
replaced
by
the
corresponding
non-orientable
surfaces.
Let
F
o
,...,
Ffc_!
be
fibres
that
divide
S
into
twisted
saddles
and
let,/,
be
an
isotopy
of
M
with
,/0
=
id
and
/,(S)
=
5'.
Standard
arguments
show
that
we
can
assume
that
./,
has
the
following
properties:
(1)
,/,(dS)
=
dS
for
all
f
e
[0,
1];
(2)
the
projection
M
-+
S1
restricts
to
a
morse
function
on
,/,(S)
for
all
t
e
[0,1].
(The
morse
function
may
not
always
have
distinct
critical
values.)
A
critical
point
of
,/,{S)
will
be
called
significant
if
its
upper
and
lower
level
sets
consist
of
arcs.
Since,
by
(1)
above,
./,(S)
meets
each
non-critical
fibre
in
exactly
two
arcs,
there
can
never
be
two
significant
critical
points
in
the
same
fibre.
Therefore
there
is
a
bundle
isotopy
,/,
such
that
the
fibres
f,{F0),...,f,{Fk-{)
separate
the
significant
critical
points
of
./,(S)
for
all
t
e
[0,
1].
It
follows
that
the
arcs
of
,/,{S)
n
/,{Fi)
are
isotopic
in
f,(Fj)
to
/t(S
n
F,)
for
all
t.
Therefore
the
fibres
,/,(F
0
),
...,/
r
,(F
k
_
1
)
divide
both
5'
and
fx(S)
into
twisted
saddles,
and
they
meet
the
two
surfaces
in
isotopic
pairs
of
arcs.
This
implies
that
S'
and
,/,(£)
are
bundle
isotopic,
so
S'
and
S
are
bundle
isotopic.

Let
M

and
let
S
and
S'
be
surfaces
of

S(p,

and

respectively.
Then
S
is
isotopic
to
S'
if
and
only
if
p

q

q'.
Proof.
It
is
clear
that
S
and
S'
are
isotopic
if
p
=
p'
and
q
=
q'.
To
prove
the
converse
it
is
helpful
to
view
M
a
little
differently.
Identify
M
with
the
bundle
Tx
//a>1;
and
let
M
be
the
quotient
of
M
obtained
by
identifying
the
boundary
of
each
fibre
to
a
point.
Thus
M
is
a
torus
bundle
over
Sl.
We
can
also
give
M
the
structure
of
an
S

bundle
over
a
torus
Z.
The
S^fibres
will
be
circles
contained
in
torus
fibres
and
parallel
to
the

of
the
closed
curve
a

{t}.
The
image
in
M
of
dM
and
the
curve
b
x
{0}
are
closed
curves
in
M
which
project,
respectively,
to
simple
closed
curves
x
and
y
in
Z.
These
two
curves
define
a
framing
of
Z.
The
surfaces
Im(S)
and
Im(S')
are
both
saturated
in
the
S'-fibration
of
M,
and
project
to
simple
closed
curves
homologous
to
p[.Y]
+
q[.y]
and
p
'
M
+

respectively.
If
S
and
S'
are
isotopic
in
M,
then
their
images
are
isotopic
in
M,
and
their
projections
are
homotopic
in
Z.
Therefore
p

Classification
of

In
Proposition
1.3.1,
we
proved
that
if
M
and
N
are
once-punctured
torus
bundles
with
characteristic
classes
[G]
and
[//],
respectively,
then
M
is
equivalent
to
N
if
and
only
if
[G]
=
[//].
Now,
by
using
the
above
structure
of
SL2(Z)
and
the
normal
form
theorem
for
free
products
with
amalgamation,
we
have
that
each
element
g
of
SL2(Z)
can
be
written
uniquely
as
g
=
PrXlX2...Xs,
where
the
A^
(1
^
j
;
^
s)
are
chosen
alternately
from
the
two
sets
{P}
and
{Q,
Q2}
and
r
e
{0,2}.
Furthermore,
since
P2
is
in
the
centre,
the
element
g
e
SL2(Z)
is
conjugate
to
an
element
whose
normal
form
FY....Y,
has
the
additional
property
that
Yi
and
Yt
are
not
both
contained
in
the
same
one
of
the
two
sets
{P}
and
{Q,
Q2}.
The
normal
form
of
this
latter
element
is
obtained
by
cyclically
reducing
the
normal
form
for
g'
and
it
is
unique
up
to
a
cyclic
permutation
of
y
l
s
...,
Yt.
We
will
call
such
a
normal
form
the
cyclically
reduced
normal
form
for
g.
We
will
call
l(g)
=
t
the
length
of
g.
Observe
that
if
l(g)
=
0,
then
g
=

or
g

if
l{g)
=
1,
then
g
is
conjugate
to
one
o{
P±i,Q±i,Q±2\
otherwise,
l{g)
is
even.
We
can
use
cyclically
reduced
normal
forms
to
classify
once-punctured
torus
bundles
over
Sl.
Namely,
except
for
bundles
with

[P*'],
[(?*

and
[

,
once-punctured

over

are
classified
by

convenient
to
use
simply
the

to
denote
the

These
correspond

The

A
special
form
for
an
element
of

is
defined
to
be
one
of
the
two
forms
listed
above.
The
fact
that
there
are
only
a
finite
number
of
types
of
essential
twisted
surfaces
in
a
given
bundle
M
is
a
corollary
of
the
following
proposition.
5.3.
PROPOSITION.
The
elements
of
a
conjugacy
class
in
SL2(Z)
can
be
represented
by
only
a
finite
number
of
special
forms.
Proof
The
proof
will
follow
from
an
estimate
of
the
length
of
a
word
in
special
form.
In
particular,
we
will
show
that
l{PJCn(k)...Bn(2)An(l))
^
2X
I
n(i)|-2/c,
;=
I
where
C
=
A
if
k
is
odd
and
C
=
B
if
k
is
even.
Since
|
n(i)\
^
2,
it
follows
immediately
from
this
estimate
that
the
elements
of
a
conjugacy
class
can
be
represented
by
only
a
finite
number
of
special
forms.
The
estimate
is
made
by
analysing
the
(syllable)
cancellation
that
takes
place
between
A"
and
Bm,
where
n,m
e
Z.
The
elements
A
=
QP,
B
=
PQ,
A~l
=
PQ2,
B~l
=
Q2P
are
cyclically
reduced,
so
the
cancellation
must
take
place
between
a
power
of
A
and
a
power
of
B.
Since
\n\,
\m\
^
2
,
this
cancellation
never
involves
more
than
half
of
the
syllables
of
A"
or
Bm.
The
situation
in
which
the
maximal
number
of
syllables
are
cancelled
is
when
a
power
of
B
(or
A)
appears
between
powers
of
A
(or
B)
with
the
same
sign;
that
is,
if
/,
m,
n,
>
0,
then
...A'BmAn...
=
...QP...QPPQ...PQQP...
=
P2...QP...Q2...PQ2P...
and
A~lB~mA~"
=
...PQ2...PQ2Q2P...Q2PPQ2...PQ2...
=
P2...PQ2...PQP...Q...PQ2....
PJA"{k)...B"{2)An{i),
In
either
case
four
syllables
are
cancelled.
In
a
word
of
the
form
J
where
J
e
{1,
—
1},
the
P
may
be
cancelled.
In
this
situation
the
maximal
number
of
syllables
are
cancelled
when
n(\)
and
n(k)
have
the
same
sign;
that
is,
if
m
>
0
and
n
>
0,
then
...AmPJAn...
=
...QPPJQ...
=
PJ+lQ2
and
...A'mPJA~"
=
...Q2PJPQ2...
=
PJ'...Q...,
where
J'
—
2
if
J
=
—
1,
and
J'
—
0
if
J
=
1.
In
either
case
three
syllables
are
cancelled.
So,
in
a
word
of
the
form
PJBn(k)...An(X\
with
Je
{0,2},
which
has
syllable
length
of
2£*|n(/)|,
there
are
at
most
2/c
syllables
cancelled.
In
a
word
of
the
form
PJA"{k)...Bn{2)A"(l),
with
J
e
{
l
,
-
1
}
,
which
has
a
syllable
length
of
|
n(i)
|
+
1,
there
are
at
most
2/c+
1
syllables
cancelled.

Computations
Given
a
once-punctured
torus
bundle
over
S1,
say
M,
our
methods
enable
us
to
find
all
essential
surfaces
in
M.
We
are
also
able
to
put
a
framing
(coordinate
system)
on
dM
and
describe
the
boundary
curves
of
all
the
essential
surfaces
in
terms
of
this
one
framing.
Using
this
latter
information,
we
can
draw
some
conclusions
about
the
closed
manifolds
obtained
by
attaching
a
solid
torus
to
dM;
namely,
we
can
describe
all
such
attachments
which
give
either
reducible
or
Haken
manifolds
(see
Remark
2.5.2).
6.1.
An
algorithm
Given
a
once-punctured
torus
bundle
over
S1
(here
the
word
'given'
can
be
interpreted
simply
as
meaning
that
we
are
given
a
representative
of
a
conjugacy
class
in
SL2(Z))
we
shall
write
down
the
steps
of
a
procedure
for
listing
all
essential
surfaces
of
type
C(J;
n(k),...,n(\))
in
the
given
bundle.
Suppose
H
e
SL2(Z).
Step
1.
Write
H
as
a
word
in
the
syllables
P,
Q,
and
Q2.
(There
are
many
ways
to
do
this;
e.g.
by
using
row
and
column
operations,
first
write
H
as
a
product
of
powers
of
A,
B,
and
P.
Then
use
the
relations
A
=
QP,
B
=
PQ,
A~x
=
PQ2,
B~l
=
Q2P.)
Step
2.
Write
out
the
cyclically
reduced
normal
form
for
H.
Obtain
/(//).
If
/(//)
<
2,
then
stop;
there
are
no
essential
surfaces
of
type
C(J;
n(k),
...,
n(\))
in
the
given
bundle.
If
l(H)^2,
proceed.
Step
3.
From
the
formula
l{PJCn(k)...Bn{2)An(l))
^
21
£
|
n(/)|
-
1
)>
2k,
where
C
=
A
if
k
is
odd
and
C
=
B
if
k
is
even,
write
all
special
forms
that
coukl
possibly
represent
elements
of
SL2(Z)
with
length
/(//).
(For
example,
suppose
that
/(//)
=
6.
Then
the
possibilities
for
special
forms
that
represent
elements
of
SL2(Z)
having
length
6
are:
k
=
1
and
|n(l)|
^
4
;
k
=
2
and
|n(l)|
=
3,
|n(2)|
=
2,
or
|n(l)|
=
|n(2)|
=
2
;
k
=
3
and
|n(l)|
=
|n(2)|
=
|n(3)|
=
2.
Of
course,
for
l(H)
large
there
are
many
possibilities;
and,
even
in
the
above
case,
the
many
sign
combinations
must
be
considered.
However,
there
are
techniques
that
systematically
eliminate
many
of
the
possibilities.
Say
in
the
above
case
that
we
were
to
consider
k
=
2
and
|n(l)|
=
|n(2)|
=
2.
Then
the
syllable
length
of
pJBni2)An{l\
with
J
=
0
or
2,
is
8.
However,
in
arriving
at
the
cyclically
reduced
normal
form
for
p-/B"(2)/4"(1)
there
are
precisely
four
cancellations
when
n(\)
and
n(2)
have
the
same
sign
and
no
cancellations
when
n(l)
and
n(2)
have
opposite
signs.
Hence,
for
k
=
2
and
|n(l)|
=
|n(2)|
=
2,
l(PJBn{2)A"{l))
is
either
4
or
8,
respectively;
and
so,
no
combination
of
n(\)
=
±2
and
n(2)
=
±2
leads
to
a
length
6
element.)
Step
4.
From
the
special
forms
obtained
in
Step
3
list
those
that
represent
elements
conjugate
to
H.
(This
step
uses
a
solution
of
the
conjugacy
problem
in
SL2(Z).
The
easiest
way
to
do
this
is
to
write
the
cyclically
reduced
normal
form
for
the
particular
special
form
in
question
and
compare
it
to
the
cyclically
reduced
normal
form
for
H,
obtained
in
Step
2.)
ONCE-PUNCTURED

There
is
an
essential
surface
of
type
C(J,n{k),...,n(l))
in
the
given
manifold
if
modulo
cyclic
permutation
of
and
only
if
the
special
form
PJC"{k)...B"{2)A"(i\
(n(/c),...,n(l)),
appears
in
the
list
obtained
in
Step
4.
6.1.1.
EXAMPLE.
We
carry
out
the
algorithm
in
a
specific
case.
We
suppose
H=
(
I
e
SL2(Z).
(This
example
corresponds
to
finding
the
essential
surfaces
of
type
C(J;
n(k),...,n(\))
in
the
knot
space
of
the
'figure-eight'
knot.)
Step
1.
H
\\
oy
\o
\j\\
Step
2.
The
cyclically
reduced
normal
form
for
H
is
QPQ2P.
Hence,
/(//)
=
4.
Step
3.
From
the
formula
4
=
l(PJCn{k)...Bn{2)An{l))
>
2(t(\n(i)\-\))
>
2k,
we
have
k
^
2;
and
the
possible
special
forms
that
represent
elements
of
SL2(Z)
with
length
4
are:
k
=
1
and
|n(l)|
^
3;
k
=
2
and
|n(l)|
=
|
n(2)
(
=
2.
For
fc
=
1
and
|n(l)|
^
3,
the
syllable
length
of
PJAn(1),
where
J
=
1
or
3,
is
21
n(l)|
-I-1;
and
precisely
three
cancellations
occur
in
arriving
at
the
cyclically
reduced
normal
form
for
PJAn{X).
So,
the
only
possibility
is
for
|
n{\)\
=
3.
We
have
PA3,
PA~\
P~XA\
P~lA~\
For
k
=
2
and
|w(l)|
=
|n(2)|
=
2,
the
syllable
length
of
pJBn(2)An(X\
where
J
=
0,2,
is
2(
|
n(2)
|
+1
n(l)
|)
=
8.
As
we
observed
earlier,
to
obtain
the
cyclically
reduced
normal
form
for
pJB"{2)A"(l)
we
make
precisely
four
cancellations
if
n(\)
and
n(2)
have
the
same
sign
and
no
cancellations
otherwise.
So,
the
only
possibility
is
for
n{\)
and
n(2)
to
have
the
same
sign,
|n(l)|
=
|n(2)|
=
2.
We
have
B2A2,
B'2A~2,
P2B2A2,
P2B~2A
-
2
Step
4.
The
special
form
PA'3
=
PPQ2PQ2PQ2
cyclically
reduces
to
QPQ2P;
and
P~lA3
=
P~XQPQPQP
cyclically
reduces
to
Q2PQP.
Both
of
these
are
conjugate
to
H.
These
are
the
only
special
forms
listed
in
Step
3
that
represent
elements
of
SL2(Z)
conjugate
to
H.
We
conclude
that
the
only
essential
(orientable)
surfaces
in
the
'figure-eight'
knot
space
(other
than
the
fibre)
are
of
type
C(\;
—3)
and
C(—
1;
3).
Both
are
genus
1
with
two
holes.
6.2.
Framing
If
M
is
a
once-punctured
torus
bundle
over
S
1
,
then
we
want
to
select
a
framing
(coordinate
system
or
pair
of
transverse
simple
closed
curves)
for
dM;
and
in
this
framing
describe
the
boundary
curves
of
all
essential
surfaces
in
M.
First,
note
that
there
is
a
unique
(up
to
isotopy)
simple
closed
curve
in
dM
that
is
the
boundary
of
an
orientable
surface.
This
curve
is
the
boundary
of
the
fibre
in
a
fibration
of
M
as
a
once-punctured
torus
bundle
over
S1
and
is
analogous
to
the
'longitude'
in
the
classical
knot
manifold
in
S
3
.
This
curve
will
be
one
of
the
curves
of
our
framing
for
dM.
We
fix
a
base
point
x
in
8T
and
let
a,
b
be
elements
of
n^T,
x),
analogous
to
a
and
b
of
Fig.
1,
oriented
so
that
dT
is
the
word
[a,
b~\.
The
group
nx{T,
x)
is
freely
generated
410
M.
CULLER,
W.

AND
H.
RUBINSTEIN
by
a
and

Let
Stab([«,
b~\)
be
the
subgroup
of
the
group
of
automorphisms
of
nx{T,
x)
that
stabilizes
[a,
b~\.
Now,
for
y
e
Stab([a,
b~\)
there
is
a
unique
(up
to
isotopy
fixing
.v)
homeomorphism
g:
(T,x)
->
(T,x)
such
that
g^
=
y.
Furthermore,
and
here
is
the
point,
if
M
=
Tx
I/g,
then
there
exists
a
unique
simple
closed
curve
t)t
in
dM
such
that
ty
is
transverse
to
the
fibre
in
M
and
t.,aty~~'
=
y(a)
and
tMy~'
=
y{b).
The
curve
t.r
along
with
the
boundary
of
the
fibre,
gives
a
framing
for
dM.
This
framing
is
completely
determined
by
the
automorphism
y
e
Stab([«,
6]).
We
call
the
elements
of
Stab([«,
6])
framings
for
once-punctured,
torus
bundles,
and
we
call
a
particular
automorphism
y
e
Stab([«,b]),
a
framing
for
the
bundle
M
=
TxI/g,
where
g
:
(T,
x)
->
(T,
x)
is
a
homeomorphism
and
g^
=
y.
If
/
maps
(T,
x)
to
(T,
x)
and
/
is
isotopic
to
g,
then
M'
=
Tx
/
/
/
i
s
a
bundle
equivalent
to
M

Tx
I/g.
The
framings
>'

and
n

differ
by
a
conjugation
by
[a,
by;
and
indeed,
they
explains
how
ty
differs
from
tn
by
'twisting'
around
the
boundary
of
the
fibre.
It
is
this
observation
that
allows
us
to
describe
the
boundaries
of
all
essential
surfaces
in
M
in
terms
of
a
fixed
framing.
Let
A
r
eSL

There
is
a
natural
map
(using
the
basis
a,
b
selected
above)
from
Stab([fl,
b])
onto
SL2(Z).
An
element
t;
6
Stab([a,
b~\)
such
that
c
is
mapped
to
X
is
called
a
framing
for
X
(X
does
uniquely
determine
a
once-punctured
torus
bundle
and
we
have
selected
a
framing
for
it).
If
Z
e
SL2(Z)
and
Z
is
conjugate
to
A',
say
X
=
VZU'1,
then
the
bundle
determined
by
Z,
Mz,
is
equivalent
to
the
bundle
determined
by
X,MX;
in
fact,
there
is
a
homeomorphism
h:

that

the

Now,
suppose
that
Mx
is
a
once-punctured

over
S1,
where
X
is
a

of

By
using
the
construction
of
§2.2,
we
can
select
a
framing,
£,
for
Z
and
describe
the
boundary
of
the
surface
of
type
C(J;
n(/c),...,n(l))
in
M

in
terms
of
this
framing.
On
the
other
hand,
if
Z
is
conjugate
to
X,
then
M

is
bundle
equivalent
to
M
and
the
bundle

contains
an
essential

We

to
describe
the

EXAMPLE.
Continuing
with
Example
6.1.1,
the
figure-eight
knot
space,
we
shall
select
a
framing
and
describe
the
boundary
curves
of
the
essential
surfaces
of
type
C(l;
-
3
)
and
C
(
-
l
;
3
)
.
Choose
the
standard
framing
for
PA~3,
that
is
(pa~3.
In
this
framing
the
boundary
of
the
surface
of
type
C(l;
—3)
has
coordinates
<4,
1>.
In
the
framing^"
'a
3
,
the
boundary
of
the
surface
of
type
C(—
1;
3)
has
coordinates
<4,
—1>.
We
need
to
compute
the
transition
index
between
<pa~3
and
q>~la3.
Set
X
=
PA~3
=
PPQ2PQ2PQ2
and
set
Z
=
P3A3
=
P3QPQPQP.
Then
for
U
=
Q2PQP,
we
have
X
=
UZU~l.
Let
p~
l<x
be
a
framing
for
V.
We
find
that
(pa"
3
412
M.
CULLER,
W.
JACO,
AND
H.
RUBINSTEIN
and
(/?"
1a)(/>~^(Z?"i<x)~l
both
take
a
to
aba'1.
Hence,
the
transition
index
is
zero;
and
the
matrix
I
I
takes
the
<4,
—1>
curve
to
the
<4,
—1>
curve.
We
conclude
that
for
the
'figure-eight'
knot
space
the
three
essential
(orientable)
surfaces
(the
fibre,
the
surface
of
type
C(l;
—3),
and
the
surface
of
type
C(3;
3))
have
boundary
curves
with
coordinates
<0,1>,
<4,1>,
and
<4,
—1>,
respectively,
in
the
framing
(pa.~3.
Notice
that
the
framing
<pa~3
is
the
standard
framing
for
the
'figure-eight'
knot
space
coming
from
a
'meridian'
and
'longitude'
pair.
In
this
example
the
transition
index
between
standard
framings
coming
from
special
forms
was
zero.
However,
for
any
n,
there
is
an
example
of
a
once-punctured
torus
bundle
having
a
transition
index
larger
than
n
between
standard
framings
coming
from
special
forms.
6.3.
Table
of
examples
Table
2
lists
all
essential
surfaces
in
once-punctured
torus
bundles
with
characteristic
class
of
length
at
most
12
(and
positive
trace).
We
also
select
a
framing
for
each
bundle
and
give
the
coordinates
of
the
boundary
curves
of
the
essential
surfaces
in
terms
of
this
framing.
Before
giving
the
table,
we
will
explain
the
notation.
The
first
column
gives
the
bundle
by
giving
a
representative
of
its
characteristic
class.
The
representative
chosen
is
a
cyclically
reduced
normal
form,
and
for
classes
having
length
not
greater
than
2,
we
use
the
short
notation
from
§5.1;
i.e.
the
characteristic
class
[QE>P...QesP]
is
given
by
[6i,...,e
s
].
So,
the
characteristic
class
listed
as
[1,2,1,2]
represents
the
class
[QPQ2PQPQ2Pl
The
second
column
gives
the
trace
of
the
class.
The
third
column
gives
a
framing.
It
is
in
terms
of
this
framing
that
everything
is
referenced.
In
most
cases
the
framing
was
chosen
as
a
standard
framing
coming
from
a
special
form
representing
a
surface
of
type
C(J;
n{k),...,
n{\))
in
the
bundle.
However,
this
is
not
always
the
case.
In
particular,
the
bundles
with
characteristic
classes
[1,2],
[1,2,
1,2],
[1,2,
1,2,1,2],
and
[1,2,1,2,1,2,1,
2]
corresponding
to
the
'figure-eight'
knot
space
and
its
2-sheeted,
3-sheeted,
and
4-sheeted
cyclic
coverings,
respectively,
are
given
the
framings
that
are
'lifts'
of
the
framing
for
the
'figure-eight'
knot
space.
The
fourth
column
lists
the
types
of
essential
surfaces
(except
for
the
fibre),
the
coordinates
of
their
boundary
curves
(in
terms
of
the
specified
framing),
and
the
topological
type
of
the
essential
surface.
For
example,
the
bundle
with
characteristic
class
[1,2,2,2]
has
an
essential
surface
of
type
C(l;2,2,
3)
with
boundary
curves
having
coordinates
<4,
—
3>
in
the
framing
<pa~5;
and
it
is
a
genus
3
surface
with
two
boundary
components.
The
fifth
column
is
titled
'surgeries'
and
it
is
divided
into
two
columns.
This
is
explained
as
follows.
If
M
is
a
once-punctured
torus
bundle
with
characteristic
class
[//],
then
M
determines
a
unique
torus
bundle
over
S
1
,
M,
by
attaching
a
solid
torus
to
dM,
sewing
a
curve
in
the
boundary
of
the
solid
torus
that
is
the
boundary
of
an
essential
disk
inside
the
solid
torus
onto
a
curve
in
the
boundary
of
M
that
is
the
boundary
of
the
fibre.
The
operation
of
attaching
a
solid
torus
to
dM,
sewing
the
boundary
of
an
essential
disk
in
the
solid
torus
onto
a
<p,
g>-curve
in
the
given
framing,
is
a
<p,
g>-surgery
on
a
section
of
M.
Our
methods
describe
precisely
which
of
these
closed
manifolds
are
not
irreducible
and
which
are
Haken.
We
list
in
the
column
titled
'reducible'
the
pairs
<p,
q}
for
which,
in
terms
of
the
given
framing,
a
<p,
</>-surgery
gives
a
manifold
that
is
not
irreducible.
We
also
list
the
topological
type
of
such
a
manifold.
For
example,
if
M
is
the
bundle
with
characteristic
class
[P

[1.2]

<0,

there

Open
Problems
There
are
some
interesting
questions
that
we
have
left
unanswered.
We
had
hoped
to
classify
the
manifolds
obtained
by
surgery
on
a
section
of
a
torus
bundle.
We
did
not
do
this.
One
of
the
problems
is
that
a
manifold
obtained
by
surgery
on
a
section
of
a
torus
bundle
does
not
uniquely
determine
the
bundle.
Since
the
number
of
conjugacy
classes
of
2
x
2
matrices
with
a
given
trace
is
finite,
homological
considerations
show
that
the
number
of
bundles
involved
is
finite
(J.
Birman
has
informed
us
that
she
can
prove
that
if
a
manifold
has
a
genus
1
open-book
decomposition
then,
in
'most'
cases,
the
associated
bundle
is
unique
and,
in
general,
there
are
at
most
two
distinct
bundles
involved).
The
3-sphere
has
two
such
bundles
(coming
from
the
'figure-eight'
and
the
trefoil).
We
gave
examples
showing
that
there
are
two
such
bundles
for
real
projective
3-space
(see
Remarks
(a)
and
(h)
in
Table
2).
However,
it
still
seems
to
be
unknown
whether
homeomorphic
manifolds
can
be
obtained
by
distinct
surgeries
on
a
fixed
bundle.
We
also
proposed
to
answer
questions
of
a
more
geometric
nature.
We
can
state
exactly
when
a
surgery
on
a
section
of
a
given
torus
bundle
contains
an
essential
torus
or
2-sphere
(or
when
it
is
Haken).
Since
Jorgensen
has
given
a
decomposition
of
the
punctured
torus
bundles
into
ideal
tetrahedra,
techniques
are
available
for
trying
to
verify
which
surgeries
are
hyperbolic
or
are
Seifert
fibred.
It
should
be
possible
to
do
this
in
the
way
that
Thurston
did
it
for
surgeries
on
the
'figure-eight'
knot.
While
we
do
not
expect
any
surprises,
this
might
be
an
illuminating
computation.
In
any
case,
the
problem
remains
open
as
to
which
surgeries
on
a
section
of
a
given
torus
bundle
are
hyperbolic
or
Seifert
fibred
(or
even
have
finite
fundamental
group).
When
Waldhausen
first
introduced
examples
of
orientable,
irreducible
3-manifolds
with
infinite
fundamental
group
that
were
not
Haken,
he
observed
that
each
of
the
examples
that
he
gave
had
a
finite-sheeted
covering
that
was
Haken.
This
led
to
the
conjecture
that
orientable,
irreducible
3-manifolds
with
infinite
fundamental
group
are
'almost'
Haken;
i.e.
have
a
finite-sheeted
covering
that
is
Haken.
This
conjecture
has
certainly
been
compelling.
Recently,
Thurston
discovered
a
large
family
of
orientable,
irreducible
3-manifolds
with
infinite
fundamental
group
that
are
not
Haken
(and
not
Seifert
fibred).
More
examples
of
such
manifolds
were
added
to
those
discovered
by
Thurston
in
the
work
of
Hatcher
and
Thurston.
Furthermore,
in
all
of
these
examples
there
was
no
evidence
for
or
against
the
above
conjecture.
We
have
given
explicitly
examples
of
manifolds
obtained
by
surgery
on
a
section
of
a
torus
bundle
that
are
not
Haken
and
yet
have
cyclic
coverings
that
are
Haken.
In
general,
many
such
surgeries
that
are
not
Haken
will
have
cyclic
coverings
that
are
Haken.
We
believe
that
the
best
method
for
approaching
this
conjecture,
in
the
case
of
ONCE-PUNCTURED
TORUS
BUNDLES
419
those
manifolds
obtained
by
surgery
on
a
section
of
a
bundle
over
S1,
would
be
to
acquire
a
better
understanding,
perhaps
even
a
classification,
of
essential
surfaces
in
manifolds
that
are
bundles
over
S
1
.
In
principle,
it
would
seem
possible
that
such
a
program
could
be
carried
out
by
methods
analogous
to
those
used
here.
However,
the
increase
in
complexity,
when
one
passes
from
SL2(Z)
to
the
mapping
class
group
of
a
higher
genus
surface,
is
impressive.
For
such
an
approach
to
succeed,
it
is
clear
that
more
sophisticated
techniques
must
be
developed
to
deal
with
the
combinatorics.
Perhaps,
from
a
more
general
point
of
view,
the
result
to
prove
is
that
if
an
orientable,
irreducible
3-manifold
with
non-empty
boundary
has
no
essential
annuli
then
there
are
at
most
a
finite
number
of
isotopy
classes
of
simple
closed
curves
in
the
boundary
of
the
manifold
that
can
be
curves
in
the
boundary
of
an
incompressible
and
boundary-incompressible
surface
properly
embedded
in
the
manifold.
