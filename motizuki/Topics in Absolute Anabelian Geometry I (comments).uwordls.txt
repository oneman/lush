The
ﬁnal
portion
[beginning
with
the
third
sentence]
of
the
statement
of
Lemma
4.5,
(iv),
should
be
replaced
by
the
following
text:
Then
the
decomposition
groups
of
cusps
⊆
H
∗
may
be
characterized
[“group-theoretically”]
as
the
maximal
closed
subgroups
I
⊆
H
∗
isomorphic
to
Zl
which
satisfy
the
following
condition:
We
have
dχcyclo
((I
l
·
J)ab
⊗
Ql
)
+
1
<
l
·
{dχcyclo
((I
·
J)ab
⊗
Ql
)
+
1}
G
G
[i.e.,
“the
covering
of
curves
corresponding
to
J
⊆
I·J
is
totally
ramiﬁed
at
some
cusp”]
for
every
characteristic
open
subgroup
J
⊆
H
∗
such
that
J
=
I
·
J.
(2.)
In
the
statement
of
Proposition
2.5,
(iv),
the
phrase
“Suppose
that
k1
either
an
FF
or
an
MLF;”
should
read
“Suppose
that
k1
is
either
an
FF
or
an
MLF;”.
(3.)
In
the
ﬁnal
portion
of
the
proof
of
Proposition
2.5,
the
phrase
“a
MLF”
should
read
“an
MLF”.
