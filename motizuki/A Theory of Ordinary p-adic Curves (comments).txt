(1.) The notation “E → τX log /S log ” in [pOrd], Chapter II, Proposition 2.6, (1),
should read “Ad(E) → τX log /S log ”.
(2.) With regard to the notation “(XTlog )Qp ”, “(XPlog )Qp ” in the paragraph immediately preceding Theorem 0.4, we note the following: Let K be a ﬁnite extension
of Qp and Y a formally smooth p-adic formal scheme over the ring of integers OK
of K, i.e., such as a suitable étale localization of XT or one of the coverings that
occurs in the inverse limit used to deﬁne XP . Then Y ×Zp Qp (i.e., “Y ⊗Zp Qp ”)
is deﬁned as the ringed space obtained by tensoring the structure sheaf of Y over
OK with K. Thus, if, for instance, Y is the formal scheme obtained as the formal
inverse limit of an inverse system of schemes
. . . → Yn → Yn+1 → . . .
— where n ranges over the positive integers, and each “→” is a nilpotent thickening
— and U is an aﬃne open of the common underlying topological space of the Yn ,
then the rings of sections of the respective structure sheaves OY , OY of Y, Y over
U are, by deﬁnition, given as follows:
def

lim
OY (U ) = ←
− OYn (U );
n

def

OY (U ) = OY (U ) ⊗OK K.

Here, we observe that OY (U ) is the p-adic completion of a normal noetherian ring
of ﬁnite type over OK . In particular, we observe that one may consider ﬁnite étale
coverings of Y , i.e., by considering systems of ﬁnite étale algebras AU over the
various OY (U ) [that is to say, as U is allowed to vary over the aﬃne opens of
the Yn ] equipped with gluings over the intersections of the various U that appear.
Note, moreover, that by considering the normalizations of the OY (U ) in AU , we
conclude [cf. the discussion of the Remark immediately following Theorem 2.6 in
Section II of [Falt]] that
def

(NorFor) any such system {AU }U may be obtained as the W = W ×OK K for
some formal scheme W that is ﬁnite over Y, and that arises as the formal
inverse limit of an inverse system of schemes

— where n ranges over the positive integers; each “→” is a nilpotent
thickening; for each aﬃne open V of the common underlying topological
space of the Wn , OW (V ) is the p-adic completion of a normal noetherian
ring of ﬁnite type over OK .
Indeed, this follows from well-known considerations in commutative algebra, which
we review as follows. Let R be a normal noetherian ring of ﬁnite type over a
complete discrete valuation ring A [i.e., such as OK in the above discussion] with
maximal ideal mA and quotient ﬁeld F such that R is separated in the mA -adic
topology. Thus, since A is excellent [cf. [EGA IV2 ], Scholie 7.8.3, (iii)], it follows
[cf. [EGA IV2 ], Scholie 7.8.3, (ii)] that R is excellent, hence that the mA -adic
 of R is also normal [cf. [EGA IV2 ], Scholie 7.8.3, (v)]. Then it is

well-known and easily veriﬁed [by applying a well-known argument involving the

immediately from a suitable version of “Hensel’s Lemma” [cf., e.g., the argument
of [AbsTpII], Lemma 2.1] that S may be obtained, as the notation suggests, as the
mA -adic completion of a ﬁnite algebra S over R, which may in fact be assumed to
be separated in the mA -adic topology and [by replacing S by its normalization and
applying [EGA IV2 ], Scholie 7.8.3, (v), (vi)] normal. Let f ∈ R be an element that

maps to a non-nilpotent element of R/mA · R. Write Rf = R[f −1 ]; Sf = S ⊗R Rf ;
f , Sf for the respective mA -adic completions of Rf , Sf . Then it follows again
R
from [EGA IV2 ], Scholie 7.8.3, (v), that Sf , which may be naturally identiﬁed [since

S is a ﬁnite algebra over R] with S ⊗R
 Rf , is normal. That is to say, it follows
immediately that
(NorForZar) the operation of forming normalizations [i.e., as in the above discussion]
is compatible with Zariski localization on the given formal scheme.
On the other hand, one veriﬁes immediately that (NorFor) follows formally from
(NorForZar).
