Abstract.
Let
Σ
be
a
nonempty
subset
of
the
set
of
prime
numbers
which
is
either
equal
to
the
entire
set
of
prime
numbers
or
of
cardinality
one.
In
the
present
paper,
we
continue
our
study
of
the
pro-Σ
fundamental
groups
of
hyperbolic
curves
and
their
associated
conﬁguration
spaces
over
algebraically
closed
ﬁelds
in
which
the
primes
of
Σ
are
invertible.
The
present
paper
focuses
on
the
topic
of
comparison
between
the
theory
developed
in
earlier
papers
concerning
proΣ
fundamental
groups
and
various
discrete
versions
of
this
theory.
We
begin
by
developing
a
theory
of
combinatorial
analogues
of
the
section
conjecture
and
Grothendieck
conjecture
in
anabelian
geometry
for
abstract
combinatorial
versions
of
the
data
that
arises
from
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
a
complete
discretely
valued
ﬁeld,
under
the
condition
that,
for
some
l
∈
Σ,
the
l-adic
cyclotomic
character
has
inﬁnite
image.
This
portion
of
the
theory
is
purely
combinatorial
and
essentially
follows
from
a
result
concerning
the
existence
of
ﬁxed
points
of
actions
of
ﬁnite
groups
on
ﬁnite
graphs
[satisfying
certain
conditions]
—
a
result
which
may
be
regarded
as
a
geometric
interpretation
of
the
well-known
elementary
fact
that
free
pro-Σ
groups
are
torsion-free.
We
then
examine
various
applications
of
this
purely
combinatorial
theory
to
scheme
theory.
Next,
we
verify
various
results
in
the
theory
of
discrete
fundamental
groups
of
hyperbolic
topological
surfaces
to
the
eﬀect
that
various
properties
of
[discrete]
subgroups
of
such
groups
hold
if
and
only
if
analogous
properties
hold
for
the
closures
of
these
subgroups
in
the
proﬁnite
completions
of
the
discrete
fundamental
groups
under
consideration.
These
results
make
possible
a
fairly
straightforward
translation,
into
discrete
versions,
of
pro-Σ
results
obtained
in
previous
papers
by
the
authors
concerning
the
theory
of
partial
combinatorial
cuspidalization,
Dehn
multi-twists,
the
tripod
homomorphism,
metricadmissibility,
and
the
characterization
of
local
Galois
groups
in
the
global
Galois
image
associated
to
a
hyperbolic
curve.
Finally,
we
consider
the
analogue
of
the
theory
of
tripods
[i.e.,
copies
of
the
proΣ
or
discrete
fundamental
group
of
the
projective
line
minus
three
points]
associated
to
cycles
in
a
hyperbolic
topological
surface.
From
an
intuitive

point
of
view,

Introduction
Let
Σ
⊆
Primes
be
a
subset
of
the
set
of
prime
numbers
Primes
which
is
either
equal
to
Primes
or
of
cardinality
one.
In
the
present
paper,
we
continue
our
study
of
the
pro-Σ
fundamental
groups
of
hyperbolic
curves
and
their
associated
conﬁguration
spaces
over
algebraically
closed
ﬁelds
in
which
the
primes
of
Σ
are
invertible
[cf.
[CmbGC],
[MT],
[CmbCsp],
[NodNon],
[CbTpI],
[CbTpII],
[CbTpIII]].
The
present
paper
focuses
on
the
topic
of
understanding
the
relationship
between
the
theory
developed
in
earlier
papers
concerning
pro-Σ
fundamental
groups
and
various
discrete
versions
of
this
theory.
This
topic
of
comparison
of
pro-Σ
and
discrete
versions
of
the
theory
turns
out
to
be
closely
related,
in
many
situations,
to
the
theory
of
sections
of
various
natural
surjections
of
proﬁnite
groups.
Indeed,
this
relationship
with
the
theory
of
sections
is,
in
some
sense,
not
surprising,
inasmuch
as
sections
typically
amount
to
some
sort
of
ﬁxed
point
within
a
proﬁnite
continuum.
That
is
to
say,
such
ﬁxed
points
are
often
closely
related
to
the
identiﬁcation
of
a
rigid
discrete
structure
within
the
proﬁnite
continuum.
In
§1,
§2,
we
study
two
diﬀerent
aspects
of
this
topic
of
comparison
of
pro-Σ
and
discrete
structures.
Both
§1
and
§2
follow
the
same
pattern:
we
begin
by
proving
an
abstract
and
somewhat
technical
combinatorial
result
and
then
proceed
to
discuss
various
applications
of
this
combinatorial
result.
In
§1,
the
main
technical
combinatorial
result
is
summarized
in
Theorem
A
below
[where
Σ
is
allowed
to
be
an
arbitrary
nonempty
set
of
COMBINATORIAL
ANABELIAN
TOPICS
IV
3
prime
numbers].
This
result
consists
of
versions
of
the
section
conjecture
and
Grothendieck
conjecture
—
i.e.,
the
central
issues
of
concern
in
anabelian
geometry
—
for
outer
representations
of
ENN-type
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.7,
(i)].
Here,
we
remark
that
outer
representations
of
ENN-type
are
generalizations
of
the
outer
representations
of
NN-type
studied
in
[NodNon].
Just
as
an
outer
representation
of
NN-type
may
be
described,
roughly
speaking,
as
a
purely
combinatorial
object
modeled
on
the
outer
Galois
representation
arising
from
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
a
complete
discretely
valued
ﬁeld
whose
residue
ﬁeld
is
separably
closed,
an
outer
representation
of
ENN-type
may
be
described,
again
roughly
speaking,
as
an
analogous
sort
of
purely
combinatorial
object
that
arises
in
the
case
where
the
residue
ﬁeld
is
not
necessarily
separably
closed.
The
pro-Σ
section
conjecture
portion
of
Theorem
A
[i.e.,
Theorem
1.13,
(i)]
is
then
obtained
by
combining
•
the
essential
uniqueness
of
ﬁxed
points
of
certain
group
actions
on
proﬁnite
graphs
given
in
[NodNon],
Proposition
3.9,
(i),
(ii),
(iii),
with
•
an
essentially
classical
result
concerning
the
existence
of
ﬁxed
points
[cf.
Lemma
1.6;
Remarks
1.6.1,
1.6.2],
which
amounts,
in
essence,
to
a
geometric
reformulation
of
the
well-known
fact
that
free
pro-Σ
groups
are
torsion-free
[cf.
Remarks
1.13.1;
1.15.2,
(i)].
The
argument
applied
to
prove
this
pro-Σ
section
conjecture
portion
of
Theorem
A
is
essentially
similar
to
the
argument
applied
in
the
tempered
case
discussed
in
[SemiAn],
Theorems
3.7,
5.4,
which
is
reviewed
[in
slightly
greater
generality]
in
the
tempered
section
conjecture
portion
of
Theorem
A
[cf.
Theorem
1.13,
(ii)].
These
section
conjecture
portions
of
Theorem
A
imply,
under
suitable
conditions,
that
there
is
a
natural
bijection
between
conjugacy
classes
of
pro-Σ
and
tempered
sections
[cf.
Theorem
1.13,
(iii)].
This
implication
may
be
regarded
as
an
important
example
of
the
phenomenon
discussed
above,
i.e.,
that
considerations
concerning
sections
are
closely
related
to
the
topic
of
comparison
of
pro-Σ
and
discrete
structures.
Finally,
by
combining
the
pro-Σ
section
conjecture
portion
of
Theorem
A
with
the
combinatorial
version
of
the
Grothendieck
conjecture
obtained
in
[CbTpII],
Theorem
1.9,
(i),
one
obtains
the
Grothendieck
conjecture
portion
of
Theorem
A
[cf.
Corollary
1.14].

The
purely
combinatorial
theory
of
§1
—
i.e.,
the
theory
surrounding
and
including
Theorem
A
—
has
important
applications
to
scheme
theory
—
i.e.,
to
the
theory
of
hyperbolic
curves
over
quite
general
complete
discretely
valued
ﬁelds
—
as
follows:
(A-1)
We
observe
that
a
quite
general
result
in
the
style
of
the
main
results
of
[PS]
concerning
valuations
ﬁxed
by
sections
of
the
arithmetic
fundamental
group
follows
formally,
in
the
case
of
hyperbolic
curves
over
quite
general
complete
discretely
valued
ﬁelds,
from
Theorem
A
[cf.
Corollary
1.15,
(iii);
Remark
1.15.2,
(i),
(ii)].
The
quite
substantial
generality
of
this
result
is
a
reﬂection
of
the
purely
combinatorial
nature
of
Theorem
A.
This
approach
contrasts
substantially
with
the
approach
of
[PS]
via
essentially
scheme-theoretic
techniques
such
as
the
local-global
principle
for
the
Brauer
group
[cf.
Remark
1.15.2,
(i)].
The
approach
of
the
present
paper
also
diﬀers
substantially
from
[PS]
in
that
the
transition
from
ﬁxed
points
of
graphs
to
ﬁxed
valuations
is
treated
as
a
formal
consequence
of
well-known
elementary
properties
of
Berkovich
spaces,
i.e.,
in
essence
the
compactness
of
the
unit
interval
[0,
1]
⊆
R
[cf.
Remark
1.15.2,
(ii)].
(A-2)
We
observe
that
the
natural
bijection
between
conjugacy
classes
of
pro-Σ
and
tempered
sections
discussed
in
the
purely
combinatorial
setting
of
Theorem
A
implies
a
similar
bijection
in
the
case
of
hyperbolic
curves
over
quite
general
complete
discretely
valued
ﬁelds
[cf.
Corollary
1.15,
(vi)].
This
portion
of
the
theory
was
partially
motivated
by
discussions
between
the
second
author
and
Y.
André.
In
the
context
of
(A-1),
we
remark
that,
in
the
Appendix
to
the
present
paper,
we
give
an
elementary
exposition
from
the
point
of
view
of
twodimensional
log
regular
log
schemes
of
the
phenomenon
of
convergence
of
valuations,
without
applying
the
language
or
notions,
such
6

AND

as
Stone-Čech
compactiﬁcations,
typically
applied
in
expositions
of
the
theory
of
Berkovich
spaces.
In
§2,
we
turn
to
the
task
of
formulating
discrete
analogues
of
a
substantial
portion
of
the
theory
developed
in
earlier
papers.
This
formulation
centers
around
the
notion
of
a
semi-graph
of
temperoids
of
HSD-type
[i.e.,
“hyperbolic
surface
decomposition
type”
—
cf.
Deﬁnition
2.3,
(iii)],
which
may
be
thought
of
as
a
natural
discrete
analogue
of
the
notion
of
a
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
of
pro-Σ
PSCtype
[cf.
[CmbGC],
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(i)].
As
the
name
suggests,
this
notion
may
be
thought
of
as
referring
to
the
sort
of
collection
of
discrete
combinatorial
data
that
one
may
associate
to
a
decomposition
of
a
hyperbolic
surface
into
hyperbolic
subsurfaces.
Alternatively,
it
may
be
thought
of
as
referring
to
the
sort
of
collection
of
combinatorial
data
that
arises
from
systems
of
topological
coverings
of
the
system
of
topological
spaces
naturally
associated
to
a
stable
log
curve
over
a
log
point
whose
underlying
scheme
is
the
spectrum
of
the
ﬁeld
of
complex
numbers
[cf.
Example
2.4,
(i)].
After
discussing
various
basic
properties
and
terms
related
to
semi-graphs
of
temperoids
of
HSD-type
[cf.
Proposition
2.5;
Deﬁnitions
2.6,
2.7],
we
observe
that
the
fundamental
operations
of
restriction,
partial
compactiﬁcation,
resolution,
and
generization
discussed
in
[CbTpI],
§2,
admit
natural
compatible
analogues
for
semi-graphs
of
temperoids
of
HSD-type
[cf.
Deﬁnitions
2.8,
2.9;
Proposition
2.10].
The
main
technical
combinatorial
result
of
§2
is
summarized
in
Theorem
B
below.
This
result
asserts,
in
eﬀect,
that
discrete
subgroups
of
the
discrete
fundamental
group
of
a
semi-graph
of
temperoids
of
HSDtype
satisfy
various
properties
of
interest
if
and
only
if
the
proﬁnite
completions
of
these
discrete
subgroups
satisfy
analogous
properties
[cf.
Theorem
2.15;
Corollary

The
main
technical
tool
that
is
applied
in
order
to
derive
this
result
is
the
fact
that
any
inclusion
of
a
ﬁnitely
generated
group
into
a
[ﬁnitely
generated]
free
discrete
group
is,
after
possibly
passing
to
a
suitable

subgroup,
necessarily
split

Here,

The

of

in
the
global

associated

Finally,
in
§3,
we
examine
the
theory
of
canonical
liftings
of
cycles
discussed
in
[Bgg2]
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
proﬁnite
theory
developed
so
far
by
the
authors.
This
approach
contrasts
substantially
with
the
intuitive
topological
approach
of
[Bgg2]
in
the
discrete
case.
From
a
naive
topological
point
of
view,
the
canonical
liftings
of
cycles
in
question
amount
to
once-punctured
tubular
neighborhoods
of
the
given
cycles
[cf.
Figure
1
below],
i.e.,
to
the
construction
of
a
tripod
[i.e.,
a
copy
of
the
projective
line
minus
three
points]
canonically
and
functorially
associated
to
the
cycle.
This
tripod
satisﬁes
a
remarkable
rigidity
property,
i.e.,
it
admits
a
canonical
isomorphism,
subject
to
almost
no
indeterminacies,
with
a
given
ﬁxed
tripod
that
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
the
cycle.
Moreover,
this
canonical
isomorphism
is
functorial
with
respect
to
“geometric”
outer
automorphisms
of
the
proﬁnite
fundamental
group
of
the
stable
log
curve
under
consideration
that
lift
to
automorphisms
of
the
proﬁnite
fundamental
group
of
a
conﬁguration
space
[associated
to
the
stable
log
curve]
of
suﬃciently
high
dimension.
Here,
by
“geometric”,
we
mean
that
the
outer
automorphism
under
consideration
lies
in
the
kernel
of
the
tripod
homomorphism
studied
in
[CbTpII],
§3.
Indeed,
this
remarkable
rigidity
property
is
obtained
as
an
immediate
consequence
of
the
theory
of
tripod
synchronization
developed
in
[CbTpII],
§3.
The
proﬁnite
version
of
the
theory
of
canonical
liftings
of
cycles
developed
in
§3
is
summarized
in
Theorem
C
below
[cf.
Theorem
3.10].
By
applying
the
translation
apparatus
developed
in
§2
to
this
proﬁnite
version
of
the
theory,
we
also
obtain
a
corresponding
discrete
version
of
the
theory
of
canonical
liftings
of
cycles
[cf.
Theorem
3.14].

study
outer
representations
of
ENN-type
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.7,
(i),
below]
on
the
fundamental
group
of
a
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
of
PSC-type
[cf.
[CmbGC],
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(i)].
Roughly
speaking,
such
outer
representations
may
be
thought
of
as
an
abstract
combinatorial
version
of
the
natural
outer
representation
of
the
maximal
tamely
ramiﬁed
quotient
of
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
a
complete
local
ﬁeld
on
the
logarithmic
fundamental
group
of
the
geometric
special
ﬁber
of
a
stable
model
of
a
pointed
stable
curve
over
the
complete
local
ﬁeld.
By
comparison
to
the
outer
representation
of
NN-type
studied
in
[NodNon],
outer
representations
of
ENN-type
correspond
to
the
situation
in
which
the
residue
ﬁeld
of
the
complete
local
ﬁeld
under
consideration
is
not
necessarily
separably
closed.
Such
outer
representations
of
ENN-type
give
rise
to
a
surjection
of
proﬁnite
groups,
which
corresponds,
in
the
case
of
pointed
stable
curves
over
complete
local
ﬁelds,
to
the
surjection
from
the
arithmetic
fundamental
group
to
[some
quotient
of]
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
the
base
ﬁeld.
Our
ﬁrst
main
result
[cf.
Theorem
1.13,
(i),
below]
asserts
that,
under
the
additional
assumption
that
the
associated
cyclotomic
character
has
open
image,
any
section
of
this
surjection
necessarily
admits
a
ﬁxed
point
[i.e.,
a
ﬁxed
vertex
or
edge].
This
“combinatorial
section
conjecture”
is
obtained
as
an
immediate
consequence
of
an
essentially
classical
result
concerning
ﬁxed
points
of
group
actions
on
graphs
[cf.
Lemma
1.6
below].
By
applying
this
existence
of
ﬁxed
points,
we
show
that
there
is
a
natural
bijection
between
conjugacy
classes
of
proﬁnite
sections
and
conjugacy
classes
of
tempered
sections
[cf.
Theorem
1.13,
(iii),
below]
and
derive
a
rather
strong
version
of
the
combinatorial
Grothendieck
conjecture
[cf.
[NodNon],
Theorem
A;
[CbTpII],
Theorem
1.9]
for
cyclotomically
full
outer
representations
of
ENN-type
[cf.
Corollary
1.14
below].
We
also
observe
in
passing
that
a
generalization
of
the
main
result
of
[PS]
may
be
obtained
as
a
consequence
of
the
theory
discussed
in
the
present
§1
[cf.
Corollary
1.15
below].
In
the
present
§1,
let
Σ
be
a
nonempty
set
of
prime
numbers
and
G
a
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
of
pro-Σ
PSC-type
[cf.

Deﬁnition
1.1,

Write
G

G,
ΠG
for
the
[pro-Σ]
fundamental
group
of

fundamental

of

[cf.

Proof.
First,
we
verify
assertion
(i).
Let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
there
is
an
inclusion
of
sub-semi-graphs
ΓG
∗
⊆
Γ
∗
|
ΓG
[cf.
Lemma
1.4,
(i)].
Next,
let
us
observe
that
it
follows
immediately
from
Lemma
1.4,
(iii),
(iv),
that,
by
replacing
Γ
by
Γ÷
,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
G
acts
without
inversion
on
Γ
[which
implies
that
G
acts
trivially
on
ΓG
—
cf.
Deﬁnition
1.2,
(i)].
Thus,
to
complete
the
veriﬁcation
of
assertion
(i),
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
the
following
assertion
holds:
Claim
1.6.A:
Let
(Γ∗
|ΓG
)0
⊆
Γ∗
|ΓG
be
a
connected
component
of
Γ∗
|ΓG
such
that
(Γ∗
|ΓG
)0
∩
Γ∗G
=
∅.
Then
(Γ∗
|ΓG
)0
⊆
ΓG
∗.
To
verify
Claim
1.6.A,
let
us
observe
that
since
(Γ∗
|ΓG
)0
∩
ΓG
∗
=
∅,
the
action
ρs,∗
of
G
on
Γ∗
stabilizes
(Γ∗
|ΓG
)0
⊆
Γ∗
.
In
particular,
we
obtain
an
action
of
G
on
(Γ∗
|ΓG
)0
over
ΓG
.
Thus,
since
the
action
of
G
on
ΓG
is
trivial,
and
the
composite
(Γ∗
|ΓG
)0
→
Γ∗
|ΓG
→
ΓG
is
a
connected
ﬁnite
covering
of
some
connected
component
of
ΓG
,
again
by
our
assumption
that
(Γ∗
|ΓG
)0
∩
ΓG
∗
=
∅,
we
conclude
that
the
action
of
G
on
(Γ∗
|ΓG
)0
is
trivial,
i.e.,
that
there
is
an
inclusion
of
sub-semi-graphs
(Γ∗
|ΓG
)0
⊆
ΓG
∗.
This
completes
the
proof
of
Claim
1.6.A,
hence
also
of
assertion
(i).
Next,
we
verify
assertion
(ii).
One
veriﬁes
immediately
that
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
Γ∗
=
Γ.
Now
suppose
that
ΓG
=
∅.
Then
since
G
∼
=
Z/lZ,
it
follows
that
the
action
of
G
on
Γ
is
free,
which
thus
implies
that
the
quotient
map
Γ

Γ/G
is
a
covering
of
Γ/G.
In
particular,
ΠΣ
Γ//G
is
isomorphic
to
the
pro-Σ
completion
of
the
topological
fundamental
group
of
the
semi-graph
Γ/G.
Thus,
the
pro-Σ
group
ΠΣ
Γ//G
is
free,
hence,
in
particular,
torsion-free.
But
this
contradicts
the
existence
of
the
section
of
the
surjection
ΠΣ
Γ//G

G
determined
by
s.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).

Next,
we
verify
the
resp’d
portion
of
assertion
(iv)
[i.e.,
the
assertion
Σ
)G
=
∅]
in
the
case
where
G
is
isomorphic
to
Z/lZ
for
some
that
VCN(Γ
prime
number
l
∈
Σ.
Let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
it
follows
immediately
from
Lemma
1.4,
(iii),
(iv),
that,
by
replacing
Γ
by
Γ÷
,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
Γ
is
untangled.
Thus,
the
assertion
that
Σ
)G
=
∅
follows
immediately
from
assertion
(ii),
together
with
VCN(Γ
the
well-known
elementary
fact
that
a
projective
limit
of
nonempty
ﬁnite
sets
is
nonempty.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
assertion
that
Σ
)G
=
∅
in
the
case
where
G
is
isomorphic
to
Z/lZ
for
some
VCN(Γ
prime
number
l
∈
Σ.
disc
Next,
we
verify
assertion
(iii).
Let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
since
Γ
disc
)G
is
a
tree,
hence
untangled,
it
follows
from
Lemma
1.4,
(i),
that
(Γ

Next,
let
us
observe
that
it
follows
imis
a
sub-semi-graph
of
Γ
mediately
from
Lemma
1.4,
(iv),
that,
by
replacing
Γ
by
Γ÷
,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
G
acts
without
inversion
on
Γ.
disc
)G
is
nonempty
and
connected
follows
imThus,
the
assertion
that
(Γ
mediately
from
[SemiAn],
Lemma
1.8,
(ii).
The
remainder
of
assertion
(iii)
follows
from
a
similar
argument
to
the
argument
applied
in
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii).
In
particular,
the
unresp’d
portion
of
assertion
(iv)
[i.e.,
the
assertion
that
disc
)G
=
∅]
holds.
VCN(Γ
Next,
we
verify
assertion
(v).
Let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that,
to
verify
assertion
(v),
it
follows
immediately
from
Lemma
1.4,
(iii),
(iv),
that,
by
replacing
Γ
by
Γ÷
,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
the
action
ρ
is
an
action
without
inversion,
and
that
every
edge
of
Γ
abuts
to
at
least
one
vertex
of
Γ.
In
particular,
since
[we
have
assumed
that]
(ΓG
)0
=
∅,
it
follows
from
Lemma
1.4,
(ii),
(v),
that
(ΓG
)
0
=
∅
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.3,
(i)].
Now
if
ΓG
is
connected,
then
one
veriﬁes
immeid
diately
that
the
trivial
covering
Γ
→
Γ
satisﬁes
the
condition
imposed
on
“Γ∗
→
Γ”
in
the
statement
of
assertion
(v).
Thus,
to
complete
the
veriﬁcation
of
assertion
(v),
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
ΓG
is
not
connected,
hence
[cf.
Lemma

contains
at

that

the

ﬁxes
an
element
of

that
maps

But
this
implies
that
αg
is
trivial,
i.e.,
that
the

coincides
with
the
action
of
G

On
the
other
hand,
since
φ
is
an

it
follows
that
(Γ∗

is
contained
in
the
sub-semi-graph
of

First,
we

Claim

If
G
is
isomorphic
to

for

then

Indeed,
it

from

[i.e.,
the

in

it
follows

that
(Γ
mediately
from
assertion
(v)
[i.e.,
by
allowing
“Γ”
to
vary
among
the
Σ

Γ]
that
(Γ
Σ
)G
is
G-compatible
connected
ﬁnite

of

connected.
Thus,
the
ﬁnal
portion
of
assertion
(vi)
[in
the
case
where
G
is
isomorphic
to
Z/lZ
for
some
prime
number
l
∈
Σ]
follows
immediately
from
assertion
(i)
[and
the
evident
pro-Σ
version
of
[SemiAn],
Proposition
2.5,
(i)].
This
completes
the
proof
of
Claim
1.6.B.
Next,
we
verify
assertion
(vi)
for
arbitrary
ﬁnite
solvable
G
by
induction
on
G
.
Let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
it
follows
immediately
from

that,

replacing
Γ
by
Γ÷

we
may
assume
without
loss
of

that
the
action
ρ

an

without

Next,
observe
that
since
G
is
ﬁnite
and
solvable,
there
exists
a
normal
subgroup
N
⊆
G
of
G
such
that
G/N

a
nontrivial

of
prime

Then
it
follows
from

that

for

This
completes
the
proof
of

Finally,
we
verify
the
resp’d
portion
of
assertion
(iv)
[i.e.,
the
asΣ

Let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that,
to
verify
the
sertion
that

it

immediately
from

we
may

that

Thus,
the
assertion
that

immediately
from

This

Remark
1.6.1.
The
conclusion
of
Lemma
1.6,
(vi),
follows
for
an
arbitrary
[i.e.,
not
necessarily

ﬁnite
group
G
from
[ZM],
Theorems
2.8,
2.10.
That
is
to
say,
the
proof
given
above
of
Lemma
1.6,
(vi),
may
be
regarded
as
an
alternative
proof
of
these
results
of
[ZM]
in
the
case
where
G
is
solvable.
In
this
context,
it
is
also
perhaps
of
interest
to
observe
that,
by
considering
Lemma
1.6,
(vi),
in
the
case
where
Σ
=
Primes
and
“Γ”
is
taken
to
be
some
ﬁnite

sub-semidisc
that
is
stabilized
by
the
action
of
G
[where
we
note
that
graph
of
Γ

is
a
union
of
such
sub-semi-graphs],
one
one
veriﬁes
easily
that
Γ
obtains
an
alternative
proof
of
the
classical
result
concerning

of

groups
on

quoted
in
the
proofs
of
Lemma

[SemiAn],
Lemma

hence
also
alternative
proofs
of

[SemiAn],
Lemma

—
in
the
case
where
the
ﬁnite
group
under

is
solvable.
Remark
1.6.2.
(i)
In
the
situation
of
Lemma
1.6,
if
G
is
isomorphic
to
Z/ln
Z
for
some
prime

l
∈

and
a
positive
integer
n,
then
the
conclusion
of
the
resp’d
portion
of
Lemma
1.6,
(iv),
may
be
veriﬁed
by
the
following
easier
argument:
Since
[as
is
wellknown]
a
projective
limit
of
nonempty
ﬁnite
sets
is
nonempty,
Σ
)G
=
∅,
it
suﬃces
to
verify

verify
the
assertion
that
VCN(Γ

Moreover,

Next,
let
us
observe
that
it
follows
immediately
from
Lemma
1.4,
(iv),
that,
by
replacing
Γ
by
Γ÷
,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
G
acts
on
Γ
without
inversion.
def
Write
H
⊆
G
for
the
unique
subgroup
such
that
Q

G/H
def
is
of
order
l;
ΓQ
=
Γ/H
for
the
“quotient

i.e.,
the
semi-graph
whose
vertices,
edges,
and
branches
are,
respectively,
the
H-orbits
of
the
vertices,
edges,
and
branches
of
Γ
[cf.
the
fact
that
G
acts
on
Γ
without
inversion].
Then
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
the
natural
morphism
of
semi-graphs
Γ

ΓQ
determines
an
outer
homomorphism
Σ
ΠΣ
Γ//G
−→
ΠΓQ
//Q
[cf.
the
notation
of
the
statement
of
Lemma
1.6].
Now
since
ΠΣ
ΓQ
is
a
free
pro-Σ
group,
hence
torsion-free,
it
follows
that
the
restriction
s(H)
→
ΠΣ
ΓQ
//Q
[which
clearly
factors
through

of
the
outer

ΠΣ
Γ//G

to
s(H)

ΠΣ

trivial,
hence
that
s
determines
a
section
Σ
sQ
:
Q
→
ΠΓQ
//Q
of
the
natural
surjection
ΠΣ
ΓQ
//Q

Q.
In
particular,
by
applying
Lemma
1.6,
(ii),
we
thus
conclude
that
VCN(ΓQ
)Q
=
∅.
Let
zQ
∈
VCN(ΓQ
)Q
,
z
∈
VCN(Γ)
a
lifting
of
zQ
,
and
g
∈
G
a
generator
of
G.
Then
since
Q
ﬁxes
zQ
,
it
follows
that
z
g
=
z
h
,
for
some
h
∈
H,
hence
that
z
is
ﬁxed
by
g
·
h−1
∈
G.
On
the
other
hand,
since
g
·
h−1
generates
G,
we
thus
conclude
that
z
is
ﬁxed
by
G,
i.e.,
that
VCN(Γ∗
)G
=
∅,
as
desired.
(ii)
The
proof
of
Lemma
1.6,
(ii),
as
well
as
the
argument
of
(i)
above,
is
essentially
the
same
as
the
argument
applied
in
[AbsCsp]
to
prove
[AbsCsp],
Lemma
2.1,

On

not,
in

phenomenon
may
be
seen
in

Suppose

i.e.,
the

and
the

are
given
by
the

and
the
group
G

acts
equivariantly
on

Here,
we
observe
that
since
N

one
veriﬁes
immediately
that

Next,

Let

Next,

that

Now
since

[cf.

for

it

It

to

that
S

This
completes
the

Since

Thus,
it

from
the
deﬁnition

we
write

for
the

Then

from

Now
suppose
that

that

that

Now
if
{

then
it
is

that

On

if

thus

This

completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii)
in
the
case
where


Then
it
follows
from
assertion
(ii)
Next,
suppose

If

we
may

that

that
the

Sz
and
Sδ
—
both
of
which
are
clearly
preserved
by
the

of
Gs
—
are
of
cardinality
≥
2.
In
a
similar
vein,
Sδ
\
(Sδ

Sz)
is
either
empty
or
of
cardinality
≥
2.
Moreover,
the
latter
case
contradicts
[NodNon],
Lemma
1.8.
Thus,
we
conclude
that
Sδ
⊆
Sz,
which,
by
the
deﬁnition
of
Sz
and
Sδ
,
implies
that
Sδ
=
Sz,
i.e.,
that,
for
any
two
distinct
z1
,
z2
∈

there
exists
a

by
[NodNon],
Lemma

that
V(

But,
in
light
of
the
deﬁnition

an

this
implies
that
Sz
=
2,
and
hence
that
Edge(G)

a
contradiction!
This
completes

hence
also
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii)
in
the

(iii).
Assertion

immediately
from
a

that

that

the

an

let

where

Now
we
claim
that
the
following
assertion
holds:
Claim
1.13.B:
The
left-hand
vertical
arrow
NI
→
ΠG
of
the
above
diagram
is
the
trivial
homomorphism.
Indeed,
let
H
⊆
ΠG
be
an
open
subgroup
and
write
NI,H
⊆
NI
and
NG,H
⊆
NG
for
the
open
subgroups
obtained
by
forming
the
inverse
image
of
H
⊆
ΠG
via
the
vertical
arrows
of
the
above
commutative
diagram.
Thus,
NG,H
normalizes
NI,H
;
the
action
of
NG,H
on
H
by
conjugation
induces
the
trivial
action
of
NG,H
on
H
ab
.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
since
H
ab
is
a
free
Zl
-module,
the
left-hand
vertical
arrow
{l}-ab-free
→
H
ab
of
under
consideration
determines
a
homomorphism
NI,H
free
Zl

of
ﬁnite
rank
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.7,
(i)],
which
is
NG,H
equivariant
[with
respect
to
the
actions
of
NG,H
by
conjugation].
On
the
other
hand,
since
the
action
of
NG,H
on
H
ab
is
trivial,
the
NG,H
{l}-ab-free
equivariant

NI,H
→
H
ab
factors
through
a

of
NI,H

which
NG,H

Thus,
since

cyclotomically
full,
and
NG,H
acts
on
NI,H

the

character
[cf.

Claim
1.13.B
follows
from

This
completes
the
proof
of

1.13.B.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
it
follows
immediately
from
Claim
1.13.B
that
the

determines
a
section
of
the

Thus,
it

that

follows,

from
a
similar
argument
to
the
argument
applied
to
prove
[SemiAn],

That
is
to
say,
instead
of
considering
“subjoints”
[i.e.,

as
in
the
proof
of
[SemiAn],
Theorem
3.7,
the
content
of
[NodNon],
Proposition
3.9,
(i),
requires
us
to
consider
paths
of

3.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion

Finally,
we
verify
assertion

Let
s,

Thus,
it

that

then

both

In
particular,
we
conclude
from

that
the

ﬁnite,
hence
that,

Corollary
1.14
(A

version
of

Let
Σ
be
a

G,

of

of

that

[cf.

such
that

=

;
l
∈
Σ
a
prime
number
such
that
ρG
and
ρH
are
l-cyclotomically
full
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.7,

Suppose
further
that
ρG
is
verticially
quasisplit
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.7,
(i)].
Write
ΠG
,
ΠH
for
the
[pro-Σ]
funda∼
mental
groups
of
G,

respectively.
Let
α
:
ΠG

be
a

that

obtained
by
conjugating
by
α
—
commutes.
Then
α
is
graphic
[cf.
[CmbGC],
Deﬁnition
1.4,
(i)].
Proof.
First,
let
us
observe
that
by
[CmbGC],
Corollary
2.7,
(i),
it
follows
from
our
assumption
that
ρG
and
ρH
are
l-cyclotomically
full
∼
that
α
:
ΠG
→
ΠH
is
group-theoretically
cuspidal.
Thus,
by
applying
[CmbGC],
Proposition
1.5,
(ii);
[NodNon],
Lemma
1.14,
we
conclude
that
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
α
is
group-theoretically
verticial
under
the
additional
assumption
that
G
and
H
are
noncuspidal.
Write
ΠGG
,
ΠGH
for
the
proﬁnite
groups
“ΠG
”
[cf.
Theorem
1.13]
associated
to
ρG
,
ρH
.
Then
it
follows
immediately
from
our
assumption
that
ρG
is
verticially
quasi-split
that
we
may
assume,
after
possibly
replacing
GG
and
GH
by
corresponding
open
subgroups,
that
there
exists
a
section
sG
:
GG
→
ΠGG
such
that
the
image
of
the
restriction
of
sG
to
IGG
commutes
with
some
verticial
subgroup
of
ΠG
.
In
particular,
sG
satisﬁes
the
conditions
imposed
on
the
section
“s
:
G
→
ΠG
”
in
Lemma
1.11,
(ii),
for
some
nonempty
subset
“S”.
Moreover,
it
follows
from
The∼
orem
1.13,
(i),
that
the
isomorphism
ΠGG
→
ΠGH
determined
by
α
and
β
maps
sG
to
a
section
sH
:
GH
→
ΠGH
that
is
contained
in
the
normalizer
in
ΠGH
of
a
VCN-subgroup
of
ΠH
.
In
particular,
after
possibly
replacing
GG
and
GH
by
corresponding
open
subgroups,
we
may
assume
[cf.
[CmbGC],
Proposition
1.2,
(ii);
[NodNon],
Remark
COMBINATORIAL

TOPICS

2.7.1]
that
the
image
of
the
restriction
of
sH
to
IGH
commutes
with
some
nontrivial
verticial
element
of
ΠH
[cf.
[CbTpII],
Deﬁnition
1.1].
Thus,
by
restricting
these
sections
sG
,
sH
to
the
respective
conducting
subgroups
and
forming
appropriate
centralizers
[cf.
[NodNon],
Lemma
3.6,
(i),
applied
to
the
restriction
of
sG
to
IGG
],
we
conclude
from
the
assumption
that
β
is
compatible
with
the
respective
conducting
sub∼
groups
that
α
:
ΠG
→
ΠH
maps
some
nontrivial
verticial
element
of
ΠG
to
a
nontrivial
verticial
element
of
ΠH
.
In
particular,
it
follows
from
the
implication
(3)
⇒
(1)
of
[CbTpII],
Theorem
1.9,
(i),
that
α
is
group-theoretically
verticial,
as
desired.

the

be
omitted.
Indeed,
if
one

then
a

that
one
obtains

Let

by
equipping
Spec(R)

the

of

Suppose,
for
simplicity,
that
X
log
is
split,
i.e.,
that
the
natural
action
of
Gal(K/K)
on
the
dual
semi-graph

the

of

def
VCN(X

)
=
Vert(X


Cusp(X


Node(X
log
).
Before
proceeding,
we
recall
that
to
each
element
z
∈
VCN(X
log
),
one
may
associate,
in
a
way
that
is
functorial
with
respect
to
arbitrary
automorphisms
of
the
log
scheme
X
log
,
a
discrete
valuation
that
dominates
R
on
the
residue
ﬁeld
of
some
point
of
X,
which
is
closed
if
and
only
if
z
is
a
cusp.
Indeed,
this
is
immediate
if
z
is
a
vertex,
since
a
vertex
corresponds
to
a
prime
of
height
1
of
X
.
This
is
also
immediate
if
z
is
a
cusp,
since
the
residue
ﬁeld
of
the
closed
point
of
X
that
corresponds
to
z
is
ﬁnite
over
[the
complete
discrete
valuation
ﬁeld]
K,
which
implies
that
the
discrete
valuation
of
K
extends
uniquely
to
a
discrete
valuation
on
the
residue
ﬁeld
of
a
cusp.
Now
suppose
that
z
is
a
node
that
is
locally
deﬁned
by
an
equation
of
the
form
s1
s2
−
a,
for
some
a
∈

[cf.,
e.g.,
the

of

(ii)].
By
descent,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
a
admits
a
square
root
b
in
R.
Then
one
associates
to
z
the
discrete
valuation
determined
by
the
exceptional
divisor
of
the
blow-up
of
X
at
the
locus
(s1

that

together
with

Next,
we
verify
assertion

Let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
it
follows
immediately
from
our
countability
assumption
on
the
residue
ﬁeld
of
R
that
the
following
three
assertions
hold:
•
If
Y
log
→
X
log
is
a
member
of
S,
and
z(Y
log
)
∈
Cusp(Y

then
the

a
subset

countable
and
dense,
i.e.,
with
respect
to
the
topology
determined
by
the
discrete
valuation
determined
by
the
element
z(Y
log
)
∈
VCN(Y

•
If
Y
log
→
X
log
is
a
member
of
S,
and
z(Y
log
)
∈
Cusp(Y
log
),
then
the
normalization
RY
of
R
in
Y
admits
a
subset
which
COMBINATORIAL

TOPICS

is
countable
and
dense,
i.e.,
with
respect
to
the
topology
determined
by
the
discrete
valuation
determined
by
the
element
z(Y
log
)
∈
VCN(Y
log
).
•
There
exists
a
countably
indexed
coﬁnal
subsystem
of
S
[cf.,
e.g.,
[AbsTpII],
Lemma
2.1].
Thus,
assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately,
by
applying
a
standard
argument
involving
Cantor
diagonalization,
from
the
well-known
[local]
compactness
of
Berkovich
spaces
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Brk1],
Theorem
1.2.1].
Here,
we
recall
in
passing
that
this
compactness
is,
in
essence,
a
consequence
of
the
compactness
of
a
product
of
copies
of
the
closed
interval
[0,
1]
⊆
R.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
We
refer
to
Theorem
A.7
in
Appendix
for
another
approach
to
proving
assertion
(ii).
Assertion
(iii)
follows
immediately
from
the
observation
that,
by
applying
Theorem

(i)
[cf.

of

together
with
the

fact
that

be
allowed
to
vary

Assertion
(iv)
follows
immediately
[cf.
also
Remark
1.7.1;
assertion
(i)
of
the
present
Corollary
1.15]
from
Lemma
1.11,
(ii).
Next,
we
verify
assertion
(v).
Let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
it
follows
immediately
from
assertion
(iv)
that
if
Y
log
→
X
log
is
a
ﬁnite
connected

log
→
X
log
that
admits
a
stable
model
over
RY
,
then
subcovering
of
X
log
z1
(Y
)
and
z2
(Y

)
lie
in
a
connected
sub-semi-graph
Γ∗

such
that
VCN(Γ∗
)
=
Vert(Γ∗
)
+
Edge(Γ∗

≤

+

=
5.
Now
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
this
uniform
bound
“5”
implies
that
there
exists
a
coﬁnal
system
S
=
{Y

Indeed,
suppose

Then
it
follows
immediately
that
there
exists
a
compatible
system
of

e(Y

of
Γ∗Y

[i.e.,
compatible
as

each
of
which
abuts
to
distinct
vertices
vα
(Y

vβ
(Y

of

[Thus,
one
may
assume
that
the
vertices
vα
(−)
(respectively,
vβ

form
a
compatible
system
of

But
this
implies
that
for

that
lies
over

if

Z

for
the
respective

Z

[so
the

Z

Y
log
extends
to
a
morphism
Z
log

Y
log
—
cf.,
e.g.,
[ExtFam],
Theorem

then
the
inverse
image
in
Z
log
of
the
node
e(Y

)
admits
at
least
one
isolated
point
[i.e.,
e(Z

hence
[since

is
Galois]
the
entire

of

On

this

the

the

of

[cf.

[SemiAn],

may
be
regarded
as
a
generalization
of
the
Main
Result
of
[PS].
These
results
are
obtained
in
the
present
paper
[cf.
the
proof
of
Theorem
1.13,

by,
in
essence,
combining,
via
a
similar
argument
to
the
argument
applied
in
the
tempered
case
treated
in
[SemiAn],
Theorems
3.7,
5.4
[cf.
also
the
proof
of
Theorem

of

with
the
existence
of
ﬁxed
points
of

of

on

that
follows
as
a

of
the
classical
fact
that
[discrete

free
groups
are
torsion-free
[cf.
Remarks
1.6.2,
1.13.1;
the
proof
of
Lemma
1.6,
(ii)].
One
slight
diﬀerence
between
the
proﬁnite
and
tempered
cases
is
that,
whereas,
in
the
tempered
case,
it
follows
from
the
discreteness
of
the
fundamental
groups
of
graphs
that
appear
that
the
actions
of
proﬁnite
groups
on
universal
coverings
of
such
graphs
necessarily
factor
through
ﬁnite
quotients,
the
corresponding
fact
in
the
proﬁnite
case
is
obtained
as
a
consequence
of
the
fact
that,
under
a
suitable
assumption
on
the
cyclotomic
characters
that
appear,
any
homomorphism
from
a
“positive
slope”
module
to
a
torsion-free
“slope
zero”
module
necessarily
vanishes
[cf.
the
proof
of
Claim
1.13.B
in
Theorem
1.13,
(i)].
That
is
to
say,
in
a
word,
these
results
are
obtained
in
the
present
paper
as
a
consequence
of
abstract
considerations
concerning
abstract
proﬁnite
groups
acting
on
abstract
semi-graphs
that
may,
for
instance,
arise
as
dual
semi-graphs
of
geometric
special
ﬁbers
of
stable
models
of
curves
that
appear
in
scheme
theory,
but,
a
priori,
have
nothing
to
do
with
scheme
theory.
This
a
priori
irrelevance
of
scheme
theory
to
such
abstract
considerations
is
reﬂected
both
in
the
variety
of
the
results
obtained
in
the
present
§1
as
consequences
of
Theorem
1.13,
as
well
as
in
the
generality
of
Corollary
1.15.
This
approach
contrasts
quite
substantially
with
the
approach
of
[PS],
i.e.,
where
the
main
results
are
derived
as
a
consequence
of
highly
scheme-theoretic
considerations
concerning
stable
curves
over
complete
discrete
valuation
rings,
in
which
the
theory
of
the
44

group
of
the
function
ﬁeld
of
such
a
curve
plays
a
central
role
[cf.
[PS],
§4].
(ii)
The
essential
equivalence
between
the
issue
of
considering
valuations
ﬁxed
by
Galois
actions
and
the
issue
of
considering
vertices
or
edges
of
associated
dual
semi-graphs
ﬁxed
by
Galois
actions
may
be
seen
in
the
well-known
functorial
homotopy
equivalence
between
the
Berkovich
space
associated
to
a
stable
curve
over
a
complete
discrete
valuation
ring
and
the
associated
dual
graph
[cf.
[Brk2],
Theorems
8.1,
8.2].
Moreover,
the
issue
of
convergence
of
[sub]sequences
of
valuations
ﬁxed
by
Galois
actions
is
an
easy
consequence
of
the
well-known
[local]
compactness
of
Berkovich
spaces
[cf.
the
proof
of
Corollary
1.15,
(ii);
[Brk1],
Theorem
1.2.1],
i.e.,
in
essence,
a
consequence
of
the
well-known
compactness
of
a
product
of
copies
of
the
closed
interval
[0,
1]
⊆
R.
That
is
to
say,
there
is
no
need
to
consider
the
quite
complicated
[and,
at
the
time
of
writing,
not
well
understood!]
structure
of
inductive
limits
of
local
rings,
as
discussed
in
[PS],
§1.6.
Remark
1.15.3.
Recall
that
in
Corollary
1.15,
(ii),
and
the
ﬁnal
portion
of
Corollary
1.15,
(iii),
we
assume
that
the
residue
ﬁeld
of
R
is
countable.
In
fact,
however,
it
is
not
diﬃcult
to
see
that,
in
the
situation
of
Corollary
1.15,
there
exists
a
complete
discrete
valuation
ring
R†
that
is
dominated
by
R,
and
whose
residue
ﬁeld
is
countable
such
that
•
the
smooth

X

•
the
closed
subgroup
H
⊆
GK
,
and
•
the
section
s
:
H
→
ΠX
log
descend
to
the
ﬁeld
of
fractions
of
R†
.
Indeed,
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
since
the
moduli
stack
of
pointed
stable
curves
of
a
given
type
over
Z
is
of
ﬁnite
type
over
Z,
there
exists
a
complete
discrete
valuation
ring
R‡
that
is
dominated
by
R,
and
whose
residue
ﬁeld
is
countable
such
that
the
smooth
log
curve
X
log
descends
to
the
ﬁeld
of
fractions
of
R‡
.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
since
[cf.,
e.g.,
[CanLift],
Proposition
2.3,
(ii)]
the
geometric
fundamental
group
“ΔX
log
”
associated
to
the
smooth
log
curve
X
log
[i.e.,
over
the
ﬁeld

is
naturally
isomorphic
to

“ΔX

”
associated
to
the
descended
smooth
log
curve
[i.e.,
over
the
ﬁeld

fractions
of

],
it
follows
that
both
of
these
geometric
fundamental
groups
are
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated
[cf.,
e.g.,
[MT],
Proposition
2.2,

and
hence

Discrete
combinatorial
anabelian
geometry
In
the
present
§2,
we
introduce
the
notion
of
a
semi-graph
of
temperoids
of
HSD-type
[i.e.,
“hyperbolic
surface
decomposition
type”
—
cf.
Deﬁnition
2.3,
(iii)]
and
discuss
discrete
versions
of
the
proﬁnite
results
obtained
in
[NodNon],
[CbTpI],
[CbTpII],
[CbTpIII].
A
semi-graph
of
temperoids
of
HSD-type
arises
naturally
from
a
decomposition
[satisfying
certain
properties]
of
a
hyperbolic
topological
surface
and
may
be
regarded
as
a
discrete
analogue
of
the
notion
of
a
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
of
PSC-type.
The
main
technical
result
of
the
present
§2
is
Theorem
2.15,
one
immediate
consequence
of
which
is
the
following
[cf.
Corollary
2.19]:
An
isomorphism
of
groups
between
the
discrete
fundamental
groups
of
a
pair
of
semi-graphs
of
temperoids
of
HSD-type
arises
from
an
isomorphism
between
the
semi-graphs
of
temperoids
of
HSD-type
if
and
only
if
the
induced
isomorphism
between
proﬁnite
completions
of
fundamental
groups
arises
from
an
isomorphism
between
the
associated
semi-graphs
of
anabelioids
of
pro-Primes
PSC-type.
In
the
present
§2,
let
Σ
be
a
nonempty
set
of
prime
numbers.
Deﬁnition

(i)
We
shall
refer
to
as
a
semi-graph
of

G
a
collection
of

as
follows:
•
a
semi-graph
G
[cf.
the
discussion
at

•
for

v,
a

[cf.

We
shall
refer
to
a
semi-graph
of
temperoids
whose
underlying
semi-graph
is
connected
as
a
connected
semi-graph
of
temperoids.
Given
two
semi-graphs
of
temperoids,
there
is
an
evident
notion
of
(1-)morphism
[cf.
[SemiAn],
Deﬁnition
2.1;
[SemiAn],
Remark
2.4.2]
between
semi-graphs
of
temperoids.
(ii)
Let
T
be
a
connected
temperoid.
We
shall
say
that
a
connected
object
H
of
T
is
Σ-ﬁnite
if
there
exists
a
morphism
J

H
in
T
such
that
J

(J)
is
a
ﬁnite
group
whose
order
is
a
Σ-integer
[cf.

discussion
entitled
“Numbers”

We
shall
say
that
an
object
H
of

is
Σ-ﬁnite
if
H
is
isomorphic
to
a
disjoint
union
of

We
shall
say
that
an

H
of

a

if
H
is
Primes-ﬁnite.
We
shall
write

for
the

[cf.
[GeoAn],
Deﬁnition
1.1.1]
obtained
by
forming
the
full
subcategory
of
T
whose
objects
are
the
Σ-ﬁnite
objects
of
T
.
Thus,
we
have
a
natural
morphism
of
temperoids
[cf.
Remark
2.1.1

T

T
Σ
.
We
shall
write
def
T
=
T
Primes
[cf.
the
discussion
entitled
“Numbers”
in

Finally,
we
observe
that
if
T
=
B
tp
(Π),
where
Π
is
a
tempered
group
[cf.
[SemiAn],

and
“B

denotes
the
category
“B

of

then
T
Σ
may
be
naturally
identiﬁed
with
B(ΠΣ

i.e.,
the

[cf.
[GeoAn],

the

the
pro-Σ
completion
ΠΣ
of

(iii)
Let
G
be
a
semi-graph
of

[cf.

Then,
by
replacing
the

“G(−)

corresponding
to
the
Σ
vertices
and
edges
“(−)”
by
the
connected
anabelioids
“G(−)

[cf.
(ii)],
we
obtain
a
semi-graph
of
anabelioids,
which
we
denote
by
GΣ
[cf.
[SemiAn],
Deﬁnition
2.1].
Thus,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved
that
the

Let

[cf.

Suppose
that
[the

G
has
at

one

Then
we
shall
write
B

for
the
category
whose

{Sv

where

[cf.

for

Sv

In

the

be
regarded

a

One

We

We

Since

tempered
[cf.
[SemiAn],
Deﬁnition

it

immediately
that

(i)
Let
T
be
a
topological

Then
we
shall
say
that
a
closed
subspace
of
T
(respectively,
a
closed

of

;
an

of

)
is
a

induced
by
the

If
D

is
a
closed

,
then
we
shall
write
∂D

D
for
the

on

determined
by
the

of
D
regarded
as
a

Let
(g,

be
a

of
nonnegative

Then
we
shall
say
that
a

consisting
of
a

X
of

a

Di

of

[where
the
“HS”
stands
for

if
2g

0.
(iii)
Let
X
=
(X,
{Di

be
a
pair
of

[cf.

Then
we
shall
write

r
◦
def
UX
=
X\
Di
i=1
[cf.

and
refer
to
UX
as
the

of
X.
We
shall
refer
to
a
circle
on
UX
determined
by
some
∂Di
⊆
UX
[cf.
(i)]
as
a
cusp
of
UX
,
or
alternatively,
X.
Write
∂UX
⊆
UX
for
the
union
of
the
cusps
of
UX
;
IX
for
the
group
of
homeomorphisms
∼
φ
:

such
that
φ
restricts
to
the

on

.
Suppose
that
Y
=
(Y
,
{Ei

)
is
also
a
pair
of
HS-type.
Then
we
deﬁne
∼
an
isomorphism

of
pairs
of
HS-type
to
be
an
IX

∼
of
homeomorphisms
X

such
that
each
homeomorphism
ψ
∼
that
belongs
to
the
IX

induces
a
homeomorphism
UX

UY
.
(iv)
Let
X
=
(X,
{Di
}ri=1
)
be
a
pair
of
HS-type
[cf.
(ii)]
and
{Yj
}j∈J
a
ﬁnite
collection
of
pairs
of
HS-type.
For
each
j
∈
J,
let
ιj
:
UYj
→
UX
[cf.
(iii)]
be
a
local
immersion
[i.e.,
a
map
that
restricts
to
a
homeomorphism
between
some
open
neighborhood

open
neighborhood,
equipped
with
the
induced

in
the
codomain]
of
topological
spaces.
Then
we
shall
say
that
a
pair
({Yj
}j∈J
,
{ιj
}j∈J
)
is
an
HS-decomposition
of
X
if
the
following
conditions
are
satisﬁed:
(1)
UX
=
j∈J
ιj
(UYj
).
(2)
For
any
j
∈
J,
the
complement
of
the
diagonal
in
UYj
×UX
UYj
is
a
disjoint
union
of
circles,
each
of
which
maps
homeomorphically,
via
the
two
projections
to
UYj
,
to
two
distinct
cusps
of
UYj
[cf.
(iii)].
[Thus,
by
“Brouwer
invariance
of
domain”,
it
follows
that
ιj
restricts
to
an
open
immersion
on
the
complement
of
the
cusps
of
UYj
.]
(3)
For
any
j,
j

∈
J
such
that
j
=
j

,
every
connected
component
of
UYj
×UX
UYj
projects
homeomorphically
onto
cusps
of
UYj
and
UYj
.
(4)
For
any
[i.e.,
possibly
equal]
j,
j

∈
J,
we
shall
refer
to
a
circle
of
UYj
×UX
UYj
that
forms
a
connected
component
of
UYj
×UX
UYj
as
a
pre-node
[of
the
HS-decomposition
({Yj
}j∈J
,
{ιj
}j∈J
)]
and
to
the
cusps
of
UYj
,
UYj
that
arise
as
the
images
of
such
a
pre-node
via
the
projections
to
UYj
,
UYj
as
the
branch
cusps
of
the
pre-node.
Then
we
suppose
further
that
every
pre-node
maps
injectively
into
UX
,
and
that
the
image
in
UX
of
the
pre-node
has
empty
intersection
with
∂UX
,
as
well
as
with
the
image
via
ιj

,
for
j

∈
J,
of
any
cusp
of
UYj
which
is
not
a
branch
cusp
of
the
prenode.
We
shall
refer
to
the
image
in
UX
of
a
pre-node
as
a
node
[of
the
HS-decomposition
({Yj
}j∈J
,
{ιj
}j∈J
)].
Thus,
[one
veriﬁes
easily
that]
every
node
arises
from
a
unique
pre-node.
We
shall
refer
to
the
branch
cusps
of
the
prenode
that
gives
rise
to
a
node
as
the
branch
cusps
of
the
node.
[Thus,
by
“Brouwer
invariance
of
domain”,
it
follows
that,
for
any
pre-node
of
UYj
×UX
UYj
,
the
maps
ιj
,
ιj

determine
a
homeomorphism
of
the
topological
space
obtained
by
gluing,
along
the
associated
node,
suitable
open
neighborhoods
of
the
branch
cusps
of
UYj
,
UYj
onto
the
topological
space
constituted
by
a
suitable
open
neighborhood
of
the
associated
node
in
UX
.]
(5)
For
any
j
∈
J,
every
cusp
of
UYj
maps
homeomorphically
onto
either
a
cusp
of
UX
or
a
node
of
({Yj
}j∈J
,
{ιj
}j∈J
)
[cf.
(4)].
Moreover,
every
cusp
of
UX
arises
in
this
way
from
a
cusp
of
UYj
for
some
[necessarily
uniquely
determined]
j
∈
J.
[Thus,
by
“Brouwer
invariance
of
domain”
—
together
with
a
suitable
gluing
argument
as
in
(4)
—
it
follows
that
every
cusp
of
UX
admits
an
open
neighborhood
that
COMBINATORIAL

arises,
for
some
j
∈
J,
as
the
homeomorphic
image,
via
ιj
,
of
a

of
a

of
UYj

If

is
an

Proof.
A
natural
equivalence
of
categories
as
in
assertion
(i)
may
be
obtained
by
observing
that,
after
sorting
through
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved,
an
object
of
B
tp
(UX
)
[i.e.,
a
topological
covering
of
UX
]
amounts
to
the
same
data
as
an
object
of
B
tp
(G).
Assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved.
Next,
we
verify
assertion
(iii).
The
assertion
that
G
Σ
is
of
pro-Σ
PSCtype,
as
well
as
the
assertion
that
the
morphism
G
→
G
Σ
determines
an
∼
outer
isomorphism
ΠΣ
G
→
ΠG
Σ
,
follows
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved.
Thus,
the
assertion
that
the
morphism
G
→
G
Σ
determines
an
outer
injection
ΠG
→
ΠG
Σ
follows
from
the
well-known
fact
that
the
discrete
group
ΠG
injects
into
its
pro-l
completion
for
any
l
∈
Primes
[cf.,
e.g.,
[RZ],
Proposition
3.3.15;
[Prs],
Theorem
1.7].
Next,
we
verify
the
injectivity
portion
of
assertion
(iv).
Let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
it
follows
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved
that
the
composite
ΠGz
→
ΠG
→
ΠG
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.1,
(iii)]
of
the
outer
homomorphism
under
consideration
and
the
outer
injection
of
assertion
(iii)
[in
the
case
where
Σ
=
Primes]
factors
as
the
composite
ΠGz
→
ΠGz
→
ΠG
of
the
outer
homomorphism
ΠGz
→
ΠGz
induced
by
the
morphism
Gz
→
Gz
of
Deﬁnition
2.1,
(ii),
and
the
natural
outer
inclusion
ΠGz
→
ΠG
[cf.
[SemiAn],
Proposition
2.5,
(i)].
Thus,
to
complete
the
veriﬁcation
of
the
injectivity
portion
of
assertion
(iv),
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
the
outer
homomorphism
ΠGz
→
ΠGz
is
injective.
On
the
other
hand,
this
follows
from
the
well-known
fact
that
ΠGz
injects
into
its
prol
completion
for
any
l
∈
Primes
[cf.,
e.g.,
[RZ],
Proposition
3.3.15;
[Prs],
Theorem
1.7].
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
injectivity
portion
of
assertion
(iv).
Assertion
(v)
follows
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved.
Finally,
it
follows
immediately
from
assertions
(iii)
and
(v),
together
with
the
evident
pro-Σ
analogue
of
[SemiAn],
Proposition
2.5,
(i),
that
the
natural
outer
injection
of
assertion
(iv)
is
Σ-compatible.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iv),
hence
also
of
Proposition
2.5.

Remark
2.5.1.
In

In

First,

Let

ﬁrst
observe
that

Thus,

we
may
assume

may
assume

one

that

let

Write

Proof.
Let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that,
to
verify
Theorem
2.15,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
Π
is
the
fundamental
group
ΠG
of
a
semi-graph
of
temperoids
of
HSD-type
G
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.3].
Next,
we
claim
that
the
following
assertion
holds:
Claim
2.15.A:
Theorem
2.15
holds
in
the
case
where
J
is
of
ﬁnite
index
in
ΠG
.
Indeed,
write
N
⊆
ΠG
for
the
normal
subgroup
of
ΠG
obtained
by
forming
the
intersection
of
all
ΠG
-conjugates
of
J.
Then
since
J
is
of
ﬁnite
index
in
ΠG
,
it
is
immediate
that
N
is
of
ﬁnite
index
in
ΠG
.
Thus,
by
considering
the
images
in
ΠG
/N
of
the
various
groups
involved,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
Theorem
2.15
holds
in
the
case
where
J
is
of
ﬁnite
index
in
ΠG
.
This
completes
the
proof
of
Claim
2.15.A.
Thus,
in
the
remainder
of
the
proof
of
Theorem
2.15,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
J
is
of
inﬁnite
index
in
ΠG
,
which
implies
that

G
[cf.
condition
(b)].
J
is
of
inﬁnite
index
in
Π
Next,
we
claim
that
the
following
assertion
holds:
Claim
2.15.B:
Let
F
⊆
ΠG
be
a
subgroup
of
ﬁnite
index
such
that
J
⊆
F
.
Suppose
that
the
assertion
obtained
by
replacing
ΠG
in
assertion
(i)
by
F
holds.
Then
assertion
(i)
holds,
and,
in
the
situation
of
assertion
(ii),
there
exists
a
ΠG
-conjugate
of
H
that
is
contained
in
F
.
If,
moreover,
the
assertion
obtained
by
replacing
ΠG
in
assertion
(ii)
by
F
holds,
then
assertion
(ii)
holds.
Indeed,
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
since
the
natural
inclusion
F
→
ΠG
is
Primes-compatible
[cf.
the
discussion
entitled
“Groups”
in
§0],
the
proﬁnite
completion
F
of
F
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
closure
F
of
F

G
.
In
particular,
the
closure
of
J
in
F
is
naturally
isomorphic
to
the
in
Π

G
.
Thus,
it
follows
from
Claim
2.15.A
applied
to
F
closure
J
of
J
in
Π
that
the
assertion
obtained
by
replacing
ΠG
in
assertion
(i)
by
F
implies
assertion
(i).
Next,
let
us
observe
that
in
the
situation
of
assertion
(ii),

G
,
by
replacing
H
by
a
since
[one
veriﬁes
immediately
that]
ΠG
·
F
=
Π
suitable
ΠG
-conjugate
of
H,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
γ

∈
F
.
In
particular,
since
H
⊆
γ
·J
·γ
−1
⊆
γ
·F
·γ
−1
=
F
,
it
follows
that
H
⊆
F
∩
ΠG
=
F
[cf.
Claim
2.15.A].
Thus,
one
veriﬁes
easily
that
the
assertion
obtained
by
replacing
ΠG
in
assertion
(ii)
by
F
implies
assertion
(ii).
This
completes
the
proof
of
Claim
2.15.B.
Next,
we
verify
Theorem
2.15
in
the
case
where
Cusp(G)
=
∅.
Suppose
that
Cusp(G)
=
∅.
Then
it
follows
from
Lemma
2.14,
(i),
that
there
exist
a
subgroup
F
⊆
ΠG
of
ﬁnite
index
and
a
surjection
π
:
F

J
such
that
J
⊆
F
,
and,
moreover,
the
restriction
of
π
to
J
⊆
F
is
the
identity
automorphism
of
J.
Now
it
follows
immediately
from
Claim
2.15.B
that,
by
replacing
ΠG
by
F
,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
ΠG
=
F
.
Next,
let
us
observe
that

to

the

in

where

it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
J

Moreover,
since
J
⊆
J

ΠG
(⊆
J),
it
follows
immediately
from
the

G

J
for
the
surjection
inequality
π
|J
=
idJ
[where
we
write
π
:
Π
duced
by

that,
to
verify
the
inclusion
J
∩
ΠG
⊆
J,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
π
(J
∩
ΠG
)
⊆
π
(J).
On
the
other
hand,
one
veriﬁes
easily
that
π
(J
∩
ΠG
)
⊆
π
(ΠG
)
=
J
=
π
(J),
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i)
in
the
case
where
Cusp(G)
=
∅.
Next,
to
verify
assertion
(ii)
in
the
case
where
Cusp(G)
=
∅,
let
us
observe
that,
by
replacing
γ

by

(
γ
−1
),
we
may
assume
without

of

that
γ

Now
we
claim
that
the
following
assertion

It

that

it

from
the

that

it

This
completes
the
proof
of
Claim
2.15.C.
In

it
follows
immediately
from
[IUTeichI],
Theorem
2.6
[i.e.,
in

in

This
exists
an

completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii)
in
the
case
where
Cusp(G)
=
∅,
hence
also
of
Theorem
2.15
in
the
case
where
Cusp(G)
=
∅.
Next,
we
verify
Theorem
2.15
in
the
case
where
Cusp(G)
=
∅.
Suppose
that
Cusp(G)
=
∅.
First,
we
observe
that
since
J
is
of
inﬁnite

G
,
it
follows
immediately
that
[ΠG
:
J
·N
]
→
+∞
as
N
ranges
index
in
Π
over
the
normal
subgroups
of
ΠG
of
ﬁnite
index,
hence
[cf.
Claim
2.15.B;
the
fact
that
J
is
ﬁnitely
generated]
that,
by
replacing
ΠG
by
a
suitable
subgroup
of
ﬁnite
index
in
ΠG
that
contains
J,
we
may
assume
without
ab
loss
of
generality
that
the
image
of
J
in
Πab
G
is
of
inﬁnite
index
in
ΠG
[cf.
Remark
2.5.1].
Moreover,
by
considering
suitable
specialization
outer
isomorphisms
[cf.
Proposition
2.10],
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
the
equality
(Vert(G)
,
Cusp(G)
,
Node(G)
)
=
(1,
0,
1)
holds.
Thus,
since
we
are
in
the
situation
of
Lemma
2.11,
we
shall
apply
the
notational
conventions
established
in
Lemma
2.11.
Moreover,
it
follows
from
Lemma

that,
by
considering
a
suitable
automorphism
of
ΠG
,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that

Thus,
it
follows
from
Lemma

(iii),
that
there
exists
a

integer

such
that

In

This

Finally,
to

Indeed,

PSC-type
(respectively,
of

of

HSD-type).
Write
J
=
ΠΣ
G
(respectively,
J
=

)
for
the
[pro-Σ
(respectively,
discrete)]
fundamental
group
of
G.
Let
H
⊆
J
be
a
VCNsubgroup
of
J.
Consider
the
following
two
[mutually
exclusive]
conditions:
(1)
H
=
J.
(2)
H
is
of
inﬁnite
index
in
J.
Then
we
have
equivalences
(1)
⇐⇒
(1
);
(2)
⇐⇒
(2
)
with
the
following
two
conditions:
(1
)
H
is
verticial,
and
Node(G)
=
∅.
(2
)
Either
H
is
edge-like,
or
Node(G)
=
∅.
Proof.
The
implication
(1
)
⇒
(1)
follows
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved.
Thus,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
[by
considering
suitable
contrapositive
versions
of
the
various
implications
involved]
that,
to
complete
the
veriﬁcation
of
Lemma
2.16,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
the
implication
(2

⇒
(2).
To
this
end,
let
us
observe
that
if
H
is
edgelike,
then
since
H
is
abelian,
and
every
closed
subgroup
of
J
of
ﬁnite
index
is
center-free
[cf.,
e.g.,
Remark
2.5.1;
[CmbGC],
Remark
1.1.3],
we
conclude
that
H
is
of
inﬁnite
index
in
J.
Thus,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
H
is
verticial
and
Node(G)
=
∅.
Now
since
Node(G)
=
∅,
it
follows
from

the
abelianization

fundamental
group

noncontractible
semi-graph

inﬁnite,
the
image
of
H
in
the
abelianization
of
J
is
of
inﬁnite
index,
which
thus
implies
that
H
is
of

that

To

it

from

[in

that

First,

Finally,

Then
the

The

Let

observe

to

it
suﬃces
to
verify
that

is

in

Moreover,
once

proves
the

in

the

YUICHIRO

AND
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
induction
[cf.
the
proof
of
[CmbCsp],
Corollary
5.1,

Thus,
we
conclude
that,
to
verify
assertion
(i),
it
suﬃces
to
verify
the
normal
terminality
of
Π1
in
ΠΣ
1.
Next,
we
claim
that
the
following
assertion
holds:
Claim
2.20.A:
Let
F
be
a
free
nonabelian
group.
Then
F
is
normally
terminal
in
the
pro-Σ
completion
of
F
.
Indeed,
since
F
is
conjugacy
l-separable
[cf.
[Prs],
Theorem
3.2]
for
every
l
∈
Σ,
Claim
2.20.A
follows
from
a
similar
argument
to
the
argument
applied
in
the
proof
of
[André],
Lemma
3.2.1.
This
completes
the
proof
of
Claim
2.20.A.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
one
veriﬁes
easily
that
there
exist
a
semigraph
of
temperoids
of
HSD-type
G
and
an
isomorphism
of
Π1
with
the
fundamental
group
ΠG
of
G.
In
the
following,
we
shall
identify
ΠG
with
Π1
by
means
of
such
an
isomorphism.
If
G
has
a
cusp,
then
it
follows
from
Remark
2.5.1
that
Π1
is
a
free
nonabelian
group.
Thus,
the
desired
normal
terminality
follows
from
Claim
2.20.A.
In
the
remainder
of
the
proof
of
assertion
(i),
suppose
that
G
has
no
cusp.
In
particular,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality,
by
applying
a
suitable
specialization
outer
isomorphism
[cf.
Proposition
2.10],
that
G
has
a
node.
Let
γ
∈
NΠΣ1
(Π1
)
be
an
element
of
the
normalizer
of
Π1
in
ΠΣ
and
Π
⊆
Π
v
G
a
1
verticial
subgroup
of
ΠG
.
Then,
by
applying
Corollary
2.17,
(ii)
[i.e.,
in
the
case
where
we
take
the
“(G,
H,
ΠzH
,
ΠzG
,
γ
)”
of
Corollary
2.17
to
be
)
and
the
“
α”
of
Corollary
2.17
to
be
the
automorphism
(G,
G,
Πv
,
Πv
,
γ
],
we
conclude
immediately
[cf.
also
of
ΠG
obtained
by
conjugation
by
γ
Corollary
2.18,
(i),
(ii)]
that
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality,
by
multiplying
γ

by
a
suitable
element
of
ΠG
,
that
the
element
γ

∈
ΠΣ
1
normalizes
Πv
,
hence
also
the
closure
Πv
of
Πv
in
ΠΣ
.
In
particular,
1
it
follows
from
Proposition
2.5,
(v);
[CmbGC],
Proposition
1.2,
(ii),
that
γ

∈
Πv
.
On
the
other
hand,
since
G
has
a
node,
it
follows
from
Proposition
2.5,
(iv),
and
Remark
2.6.1
that
Πv
is
a
free
nonabelian
group,
and
Πv
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
pro-Σ
completion
of
Πv
.
Thus,
it
follows
from
Claim
2.20.A
that
γ

∈
Πv
⊆
ΠG
,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
Corollary
2.19,
(i).
Next,
we
verify
assertion
(iii).
Let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
since
[we
have
assumed
that]
the
right-hand
vertical
arrow
of
the
diagram
of
assertion
(iii)
is
injective,
it
follows
immediately
from
assertion
(i)
that
all
arrows
of
the
diagram
of
assertion
(iii)
are
injective.
Let
α
∈
OutF
(Πn
)
be
such
that

n
)
lies
in
the
image
of
the
right-hand
vertical
the
image
of
α
in
OutF
(Π
arrow
of
the
diagram
of
assertion
(iii).
Then
it
follows
from
[CbTpI],

n
)
is
FC-admissible.
Theorem
A,
(ii),
that
the
image
of
α

OutF
(Π
FC
Thus,
it
follows
from
assertion
(ii)
that
α
∈
Out
(Πn
).
In
particular,
it
follows
from
[NodNon],
Corollary
6.6,
that
there
exists
a
uniquely

determined
element
of
OutFC
(Πn+1
)
whose
image
in
OutF
(Πn
)
coincides
with
α
∈
OutF
(Πn
).
Thus,
since
all
arrows
of
the
diagram
of
assertion
(iii)
are
injective
[as
veriﬁed
above],
we
conclude
that
the
diagram
of
assertion
(iii)
is
cartesian.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii).
Assertion
(iv)
follows
immediately
from
[CbTpI],
Theorem
A,
(ii),
together
with
assertion
(ii).
Assertion
(v)
follows
immediately
from
a
similar
argument
to
the
argument
applied
in
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii),
together
with
the

portion

B.
Assertion
(vi)
follows
immediately
from
[CbTpII],
Theorem
A,
(ii),
together
with
assertions
(i),
(ii),
(v).
This
completes
the
proof
of
Corollary
2.20.

Remark
2.20.1.
It
follows
from
[CbTpII],
Theorem
A,
(i),
that
if
either
n
=
1
or
r
=
0,
then
the
right-hand
vertical
arrow
of
the
diagram
of
Corollary
2.20,

is
injective.
Remark
2.20.2.
In
the

the

of

OutFC

the

Moreover,
the
image
of

is
dense,
relative

Proof.
Assertion
(i)
follows
from
Corollary

(i).
Next,
we
verify
assertion
(ii).
The
inclusion
Dehn(GX

⊆
Dehn(GX

∩
Out(ΠGX

follows
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved.
To
verify
the
reverse
inclusion,
let
α
∈
Dehn(GX
log
)
∩
Out(ΠGX
log
).
Then
it
follows
immediately
from
Corollary
2.19,
(i),
together
with
the
deﬁnition
of
Dehn(GX
log
),
that
the
outomorphism
α
of
ΠGX
log
satisﬁes
the
condition
(a)
in
the
statement
of
Corollary
2.21.
Moreover,
it
follows
immediately
from
Proposition
2.5,
(v),
and
Corollary
2.20,
(i),
together
with
the
deﬁnition
of
Dehn(GX

),
that
the
outomorphism
α
of
ΠGX
log
satisﬁes
the
condition
(b)
in
the
statement
of
Corollary
2.21.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Finally,
we
verify
assertion
(iii).
First,
let
us
observe
that
it
follows
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved
that
the
homomorphism
of
the
ﬁnal
display
of
Example
2.4,
(i),
factors
through
Dehn(GX
log
)
and
has
dense
image
[i.e.,
relative
to
the
proﬁnite
topology]
in
Dehn(GX

[cf.
[CbTpI],
Proposition
5.6,

Next,
let
us
recall
from
[CbTpI],
Theorem

that
if,
for

write

in

where
we
take
“(G,

[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.9]
and
regard
Dehn((GX

)
as
a
closed
subgroup
of
Dehn(GX
log
)
via
the
specialization
outer
isomorphism
of
[CbTpI],
Deﬁnition
2.10
[cf.
also
Remark
2.9.1,
Proposition
2.10
of
the
present
paper],
then
we
have
an
equality

Dehn((GX
log
)∧Se
)
Dehn(GX
log
)
=
e∈Node(GX
log
)

—
where
each
direct
summand
is
[noncanonically]
isomorphic
to
Z.
Here,
we
note
that
these
specialization
outer
isomorphisms
are
compatible
[cf.
[CbTpI],
Proposition
5.6,
(ii),
(iii),
(iv)]
with
the
corresponding
homomorphisms
of
the
ﬁnal
display
of
Example
2.4,
(i).
Thus,
in
light
of
the
density
assertion
that
has
already
been
veriﬁed,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that,
to
complete
the
veriﬁcation
of
assertion
(iii),
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
the
image
of
Dehn(GX
log
)
via
the
projection
to
any
direct
summand
of
the
direct
sum
decomposition
of
the
above
display
is
contained
in
some
submodule
of
the
direct
summand
that
is
isomorphic
to
Z.
To
this
end,
let
us
recall
from
[CbTpI],
Theorem
4.8,
(iv),
that
such
an
image
via
a
projection
to
a
direct
summand
may
be
computed
by
considering
the
homomorphism
of
the
ﬁrst
display
of
[CbTpI],
Lemma
4.6,
(ii),
i.e.,
which
determines
an
isomorphism
between
the
die
rect
summand
under
consideration
and
any
proﬁnite
nodal
subgroup
Π
associated
to
the
node
e
corresponding
to
the
direct
summand.
On
the
other
hand,
it
follows
immediately
—
in
light
of
the
deﬁnition
of
this
isomorphism
—
from
Proposition
2.5,
(v);
Corollary
2.17,
(i),
that
the
image
of
Dehn(GX

under
consideration
is
contained
in
a
suitable
discrete
nodal
subgroup
Πe
(∼

associated
to

Suppose
that
the
semi-graph

anabelioids

PSCtype
G
associated
to
X
log
[cf.
[CbTpII],
Deﬁnition
3.1,

is
totally
degenerate
[cf.
[CbTpI],
Deﬁnition
2.3,

Recall
that
G
may
be
naturally
identiﬁed
with
the
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
of
pro-Primes
PSC-type
determined
by
G
disc
[cf.
Proposition
2.5,
(iii);
the
discussion
of
Deﬁnition
2.23,
(i)].
Then
one
has
an
equality
Aut(G
disc
)−
=
Aut(G)
∩
OutC
(Πdisc
)−
(⊆
OutC
(Π))
—
where
the
superscript
“−

denote
the
closure
in
the
proﬁnite
topology
—
of
subgroups
of
OutC
(Π)
[cf.
Corollary
2.20,
(i)].
Proof.
First,
we
verify
assertion
(i).
The
injectivity
portion
of
assertion
(i)
follows
from
Corollary
2.20,
(i).
The
ﬁrst
equality
follows
from
Corollary
2.20,
(ii).
Thus,
the
second
and
third
equalities
follow
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved;
the
fourth
equality
follows
from
Corollary
2.20,
(v).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Next,
we
verify
assertion
(ii).
The
inclusions
OutC
(T
)Δ+
⊆
OutC
(T
)Δ
⊆
OutC
(T
)cusp
follow
from
assertion
(i),
together
with
[CbTpII],
Lemma
3.5.
The
inclusion
OutC
(T
)cusp
⊆
OutC
(T
)Δ+
and
the
assertion
that
OutC
(T
)cusp
∼
=
Z/2Z
follow
immediately
from
[CmbCsp],
Corollary
5.3,
(i),
together
with
a
classical
result
of
Nielsen
[cf.
[CmbCsp],
Remark
5.3.1].
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
ﬁrst
line
of
the
display
of
assertion
(ii).
Now
since
OutC
(T
)Δ
=
OutC
(T
)cusp
,
by
considering
the
action
of
OutC
(T
)
on
the
set
of
the
T
-conjugacy
classes
of
cuspidal
inertia
subgroups
of
T
,
we
obtain
an
exact
sequence
1
−→
OutC
(T
)Δ
−→
OutC
(T
)
−→
S3
−→
1.
By
considering
outomorphisms
of
T
arising
from
automorphisms
of
analytic
spaces,
one
obtains
a
section
of
this
sequence;
moreover,
it
follows
from
the
deﬁnition
of
OutC
(T
)Δ
that
this
section
determines
∼
an
isomorphism
OutC
(T
)Δ
×
S3
→
OutC
(T
).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Next,
we
verify
assertion
(iii).
Recall
that
every
ﬁnite
index
subgroup
of
T
is
normally
terminal
in
its
proﬁnite
completion
[cf.
Corollary
2.20,
(i)]
and
center-free
[cf.
Remark
2.6.1].
Thus,
assertion
(iii)
follows
immediately
from
[CbTpII],
Theorem
3.16,
(i).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii).
Next,
we
verify
assertion
(iv).
First,
let
us
observe
that
it
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
the
notion
of
a
central
tripod
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.23,
(iii);
[CbTpII],
Deﬁnition
3.7,
(ii)]
that
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
n
=
3.
To
verify
the
equality
of
the
ﬁrst
display
of
assertion
(iv),
we
mimick
the
argument
in
the
proﬁnite
case
given
in
the
proof
of
[CmbCsp],
Corollary

α

Now
observe
that
2
)
for
the
automorphism
induced
by
α
F
disc
since
α
∈
Out
(Πn
),
it
follows
immediately
from
Corollary
2.20,
(iv),
2
preserves
that
α
2
determines
an
element
of
OutFC
(Πdisc
2
),
hence
that
α
the
Πdisc
-conjugacy
class
of
inertia
groups
associated
to
the
diagonal
2
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.22;
the
discussion
of
cusp
of
any
of
the
ﬁbers
of
pan
2/1
[CmbCsp],
Remark
1.1.5].
Thus,
by
replacing
α

by
the
composite
of
α

with
a
suitable
inner
automorphism,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
α
2
preserves
the
inertia
group
associated
to
some
F
disc
diagonal
cusp
of
a
ﬁber
of
pan
2/1
.
Now
the
fact
that
α
∈
Out
(Πn
)[T
]
follows
immediately
from
Corollary
2.17,
(ii);
[CbTpII],
Theorem
1.9,
(ii)
[cf.
the
application
of
[CmbCsp],
Proposition
1.3,
(iv),
in
the
proof
of
[CmbCsp],
Corollary
1.10,
(i)].
The
assertion
that
the
restriction
to
F
disc
OutFC
(Πdisc
n
)
of
the
homomorphism
Out
(Πn
)
→
Out(T
)
of
assertion
(iii)
factors
through
OutC
(T
)Δ+
⊆
Out(T
)
follows
immediately
from
from
assertions
(i)
and
(ii),
together
with
[CbTpII],
Theorem
3.16,
(v).
The
assertion
that
the
resulting
homomorphism
is
surjective
follows
immediately
from
the
fact
that
the
[unique]
nontrivial
element
of
OutC
(T
)Δ+
is
the
outomorphism
induced
by
complex
conjugation
[cf.
[CmbCsp],
Remark
5.3.1],
together
with
the
[easily
veriﬁed]
fact
that
the
pointed
stable
curve
over
C
corresponding
to
the
given
stable
log
curve
X
log
may
be
assumed,
without
loss
of
generality
—
i.e.,
by
applying
a
suitable
specialization
isomorphism
[cf.
the
discussion
preceding
[CmbCsp],
Deﬁnition
2.1,
as
well
as
[CbTpI],
Remark
5.6.1]
and
observing
that
such
specialization
isomorphisms
are
compatible
with
the
various
discrete
fundamental
groups
involved
[cf.
Remarks
2.9.1
and
2.10.1]
—
to
be
deﬁned
over
R.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iv).
Next,
we
verify
assertion
(v).
It
follows
immediately
from
the
classiﬁcation
of
E-strict
tripods
given
in
[CbTpII],
Lemma
3.8,
(ii),
that
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
E

=
n
≤
3.
When
n
=
3,
assertion
(v)
follows
formally
from
assertion
(iv).
When
n
=
1,
assertion
(v)
follows
immediately
from
Corollary
2.17,
(ii).
Thus,
it
remains
to
consider
the
case
where
n
=
2,
i.e.,
where
the
tripod
T
arises
from
an
edge.
In
this
case,
assertion
(v)
follows
from
a
similar
argument
to
the
argument
applied
in
the
proof
of
assertion
(iv).
That
is
to
say,
let
α
∈
OutF
(Πdisc

∈
Aut(Πdisc
2
),
α
2
)
a
lifting
of
α.
Write
disc
α
1
∈
Aut(Π1
)
for
the
automorphism
induced
by
α
;
β1
∈
Aut(Π1
),
.
Then
we
must
β
∈
Aut(Π2
)
for
the
automorphisms
determined
by
α
F
disc
verify
that
α
∈
Out
(Π2
)[T
]
under
the
assumption
that
β
determines
an
element
β
∈
OutF
(Π2
)[T].
Now
observe
that
it
follows
immediately
from
the
computation
of
the
centralizer
given
in
[CbTpII],
Lemma
3.11,
(vii),
that
β1
preserves
the
Π1
-conjugacy
class
of
edge-like
subgroups
of
Π1
determined
by
the
edge
that
gives
rise
to
the
tripod
T
.
Thus,
we
conclude
from
Corollary
2.17,
(ii),
that,
by
replacing
α

88
YUICHIRO
HOSHI
AND
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
by
the
composite
of
α

with
a
suitable
inner
automorphism,
we
may
correassume
that
α
1
preserves
a
speciﬁc
edge-like
subgroup
of
Πdisc
1
sponding
to
the
edge
that
gives
rise
to
the
tripod
T
.
Note
that
this
assumption
implies,
in
light
of
the
commensurably
terminality
of
edgelike
subgroups
[cf.
[CmbGC],
Proposition
1.2,
(ii)],
that
β
preserves
the
Π2/1
-conjugacy
class
of
the
tripod
T.
In
particular,
we
conclude,
as
in
the
proof
of
assertion
(iv),
i.e.,
by
applying
Corollary
2.17,
(ii),
that
α
∈
OutF
(Πdisc
2
)[T
],
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(v).
Finally,
we
verify
assertion
(vi).
First,
let
us
observe
that
it
follows
immediately
from
Corollary
2.20,
(v),
that
both
sides
of
the
equality
FC
C
−
in
question
are
⊆
OutFC
(Πdisc
3
)
⊆
Out
(Π3
)
(⊆
Out
(Π)).
Also,
we
observe
that,
by
considering
the
case
where
X
log
is
deﬁned
over
R
[cf.
the
proof
of
assertion
(iv)],
it
follows
immediately
that
both
sides
of
the
equality
in
question
surject,
via
the
tripod
homomorphism
of
assertion
(iv),
onto
the
ﬁnite
group
of
order
two
that
appears
as
the
image
of
this
tripod
homomorphism
[cf.
also
the
fact
that
the
topological
group
Out(T)
is
proﬁnite,
hence,
in
particular,
Hausdorﬀ].
In
particular,
to
complete
the
proof
of
assertion
(v),
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
the
evident
inclusion
Aut(G
disc
)−
∩OutFC
(Π3
)geo
⊆
Aut(G)
∩
OutC
(Πdisc
)−
∩
OutFC
(Π3
)geo
—
where
we
write
OutFC
(Π3
)geo
⊆
OutFC
(Π3
)
for
the
kernel
of
the
tripod
homomorphism
on
OutFC
(Π3
)
[cf.
[CbTpII],
Deﬁnition
3.19]
—
of
subgroups
of
OutC
(Π)
is,
in
fact,
an
equality.
On
the
other
hand,
since
Dehn(G)
is
a
normal
open
subgroup
of
both
Aut(G
disc
)−
∩
OutFC
(Π3
)geo
and
Aut(G)
∩
OutC
(Πdisc
)−
∩
OutFC
(Π3
)geo
[cf.
Corollary
2.21,
(iii);
[CbTpI],
Theorem
4.8,
(i);
the
commutative
diagram
of
[CbTpII],
Corollary
3.27,
(ii)],
and
Aut(G
disc
)−
∩
OutFC
(Π3
)geo
clearly
surjects
onto
the
ﬁnite
group
of
automorphisms
of
the
underlying
semigraph
of
G
disc
,
the
desired
equality
follows
immediately
from
[CbTpII],
Corollary
3.27,
(ii).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(vi).

Remark
2.24.1.
It
is
not
clear
to
the
authors
at
the
time
of
writing
whether
or
not
one
can
remove
the
strictness
assumption
imposed
in
Theorem
2.24,
(v).
Indeed,
from
the
point
of
view
of
induction
on
n,
the
essential
diﬃculty
in
removing
this
assumption
may
already
be
seen
in
the
case
of
a
non-E-strict
tripod
when
E

=
n
=
2.
From
another
point
of
view,
this
diﬃculty
may
be
thought
of
as
arising
from
the
lack
of
an
analogue
for
discrete
topological
fundamental
groups
of
n-th
conﬁguration
spaces,
when
n
≥
2,
of

Remark
2.24.2.
(i)
In
the
notation
of
Theorem
2.24,
let
us
observe
that
it
follows
from
Corollary
2.19,
(i),
that
we
have
an
equality
Aut(G
disc
)
=
Aut(G)
∩
OutC
(Πdisc
)
(⊆
OutC
(Π))
of
subgroups
of
OutC
(Π)
[cf.
Corollary
2.20,
(i)].
On
the
other
hand,
it
is
by
no
means
clear
whether
or
not
the
evident
inclusion
Aut(G
disc
)−
⊆
Aut(G)
∩
OutC
(Πdisc
)−
(⊆
OutC
(Π))
(∗)
—
where
the
superscript
“−
’s”
denote
the
closure
in
the
proﬁnite
topology
—
is
an
equality
in
general.
On
the
other
hand,
when
X
log
is
totally
degenerate,
this
equality
is
the
content
of
Theorem
2.24,
(vi).
(ii)
We
continue
to
use
the
notation
of
(i).
Write
MQ
for
the
moduli
stack
of
hyperbolic
curves
of
type
(g,
r)
over
Q
and
CQ
→
MQ
for
the
tautological
hyperbolic
curve
over
MQ
.
Thus,
def
for
appropriate
choices
of
basepoints,
if
we
write
ΠC
=
π1
(CQ
),
def
ΠM
=
π1
(MQ
)
for
the
respective
étale
fundamental
groups,
then
we
obtain
an
exact
sequence
of
proﬁnite
groups
1
−→
ΔC/M
−→
ΠC
−→
ΠM
−→
1
—
where
ΔC/M
is
deﬁned
so
as
to
render
the
sequence
exact
—
as
well
as
a
natural
outer
representation
ρM
:
ΠM
−→
OutC
(Π)
—
where,
by
choosing
appropriate
basepoints,
we
identify
Π
with
ΔC/M
—
and
a
natural
outer
surjection
ΠM

G
Q
onto
the
absolute
Galois
group
GQ
of
Q
[cf.
the
discussion
of
[CbTpII],
Remark
3.19.1].
Write
GR
⊆
GQ
for
the
decomposition
group
[which
is
well-deﬁned
up
to
GQ
-conjugation]
of
the
unique
archimedean
prime
of
Q.
In
the
spirit
of
[Bgg1],
[Bgg2],
[Bgg3],
let
us
write
def
Γ
=
OutC
(Πdisc
)
(⊆
OutC
(Π));
def
Γ̌
=
ρM
(ΠM
×GQ
GR
)
[cf.
Corollary
2.20,
(i)].
Thus,
for
appropriate
choices
of
basepoints,
Γ̌
is
equal
to
the
closure
of
Γ
in
OutC
(Π).
If
σ
is
a
simplex
of
the
complex
of
proﬁnite
curves
L(Π)
studied
in
[Bgg1],
[Bgg2],
[Bgg3],
that
arises
from
Πdisc
,
then
the
stabilizer
in
Γ
of
σ
is
denoted
Γσ
,
while
the
stabilizer
in
Γ̌
of
the
image
of
σ
in
the
proﬁnite
curve
complex
corresponding
to
Γ̌
is
denoted
Γ̌σ
.
Then
[Bgg3],
Theorem
4.2
[cf.
also
[Bgg1],
Proposition
6.5],
asserts
that
90
YUICHIRO
HOSHI
AND

The
natural
inclusion
Γ−
σ
⊆
Γ̌σ
is,
in
fact,
an
equality.
Translated
into
the
language
of
the
present
paper,
this
assertion
corresponds
precisely
to
the
assertion
that
the
inclusion
(∗)
considered
in
(i)
is,
in
fact,
an
equality.
In
particular,
Theorem
2.24,
(vi),
corresponds,
essentially,
to
a
special
case
[i.e.,
the
totally
degenerate
case]
of
[Bgg3],
Theorem
4.2.
At
a
more
concrete
level,
when
Node(G)
=
1,
and
σ
arises
from
a
single
simple
closed
curve
that
corresponds
to
the
unique
node
e
of
G,
this
assertion
corresponds
precisely
to
the
assertion
that
the
proﬁnite
stabilizer
in
Γ̌
of
the
Π-conjugacy
class
of
nodal
subgroups
of
Π
determined
by
e
coincides
with
the
closure
in
Γ̌
of
the
discrete
stabilizer
in
Γ
of
the
Πdisc
-conjugacy
class
of
nodal
subgroups
of
Πdisc
determined
by
e
—
cf.
Theorem
3.3,
Remark
3.3.1,
Corollary
3.4
in
§3
below.
As
discussed
in
(i),
this
sort
of
assertion
is
highly
nontrivial.
That
is
to
say,
this
sort
of
coincidence
between
a
proﬁnite
stabilizer
and
the
closure
of
a
corresponding
discrete
stabilizer
is,
in
fact,
false
in
general,
as
the
example
given
in
(iv)
below
demonstrates.
In
particular,
this
sort
of
coincidence
is
by
no
means
a
consequence
of
superﬁcial
“general
nonsense”-type
considerations,
but
rather,
when
true
[cf.,
e.g.,
the
case
treated
in
Theorem
2.24,
(vi)],
a
consequence
of
deep
properties
of
the
speciﬁc
groups
and
speciﬁc
spaces
[on
which
these
groups
act]
under
consideration.
(iii)
In
closing,
we
observe
that
many
of
the
results
derived
in
[Bgg3]
as
a
consequence
of
the
assertion
discussed
in
(ii)
were,
in
fact,
already
obtained
in
earlier
papers
by
the
authors.
Indeed,
the
faithfulness
asserted
in
[Bgg3],
Theorem
7.7
—
i.e.,
the
injectivity
of
the
restriction
of
ρM
to
a
section
GF
→
ΠM
arising
from
a
hyperbolic
curve
of
type
(g,
r)
deﬁned
over
a
number
ﬁeld
F
—
is
a
special
case
of
[NodNon],
Theorem
C.
On
the
other
hand,
in
[CbTpI],
Theorem
D,
a
computation
is
given
of
the
centralizer
in
OutC
(Π)
of
an
open
subgroup
of
Γ̌.
Thus,
the
computation
of
centers
given
in
[Bgg3],
Corollary
6.2,
amounts
to
a
special
case
of
[CbTpI],
Theorem
D.
Finally,
[Bgg3],
Corollary
7.6
—
which
may
be
regarded
as
the
assertion
that
the
inverse
image
via
ρM
of
the
centralizer
of
Γ̌
in
OutC
(Π)
maps
trivially
to
GQ
—
amounts
to
a
concatenation
of
•
the
computation
of
the
centralizer
given
in
[CbTpI],
Theorem
D,
with
•
the
fact,
stated
in
[NodNon],
Corollary
6.4,
that
ρ−1
M
(Γ̌)
maps
trivially
to
GQ
.

Canonical
liftings
of
cycles
In
the
present
§3,
we
discuss
certain
canonical
liftings
of
cycles
[cf.
Theorems
3.10,
3.14
below].
These
canonical
liftings
are
constructed
in
a
fashion
illustrated
in
Figure
1.
This
approach
to
constructing
such
canonical
liftings
was
motivated
[cf.
Remark
3.10.1
below]
by
the
arguments
of
[Bgg2],
where
these
canonical
liftings
were
applied,
in
the
context
of
the
congruence
subgroup
problem
for
hyperelliptic
modular
groups,
to
derive
certain
injectivity
results
[cf.
[Bgg2],
§2],
which
may
be
regarded
as
special
cases
of
[NodNon],
Theorem
B.
Unfortunately,
however,
the
authors
of
the
present
paper
were
unable
to
follow
in
detail
these
arguments
of
[Bgg2],
which
appear
to
be
based
to
a
substantial
extent
on
geometric
intuition
concerning
the
geometry
of
topological
surfaces.
Although,
in
the
development
of
the
present
series
of
papers
on
combinatorial
anabelian
geometry,
the
authors
were
motivated
by
similar
geometric
intuition,
the
proofs
of
the
results
given
in
the
present
series
of
papers
proceed
by
means
of
purely
combinatorial
and
algebraic
arguments
concerning
combinatorial
[e.g.,
graphs]
and
grouptheoretic
[e.g.,
proﬁnite
fundamental
groups]
data
that
arises
from
a
pointed
stable
curve.
From
the
point
of
view
of
arithmetic
geometry,
the
geometric
intuition
which
underlies
the
topological
arguments
given
in
[Bgg2]
involving
objects
such
as
topological
Dehn
twists
is
of
an
essentially
archimedean
nature,
hence,
in
particular,
is
fundamentally
incompatible,
at
least
from
the
point
of
view
of
establishing
a
rigorous
mathematical
formulation,
with
the
highly
nonarchimedean
properties
of
proﬁnite
fundamental
groups,
as
studied
in
the
present
series
of
papers
—
cf.
the
discussion
of
[SemiAn],
Remark
1.5.1.
It
was
this
state
of
aﬀairs
that
motivated
the
authors
to
give,
in
the
present
§3,
a
formulation
of
the
constructions
of
[Bgg2],
§2,
in
terms
of
the
purely
combinatorial
and
algebraic
techniques
developed
in
the
present
series
of
papers.

let

(Graphicity

In

Let

our

conjugacy

Let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
it
follows
from
condition
(a),
together
with
[CmbGC],
Proposition
1.2,
(i),
that
α
determines
a
bijection
∼
Node(G)

so
Node(G)
=
Node(Y

.
We
verify
Proposition
3.2
by
induction
on
Node(G)
=
Node(Y

.
If
Node(G)
=
Node(Y
G)
=
∅,
then
Proposition
3.2
is
immediate.
Thus,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of

that
Node(G),
Node(Y

=
∅.
Let
e

Write

corresponds,
via

that

not

Let

be
a

that
maps
to
a

associated
to

Thus,
it
follows
immediately
from
[NodNon],
Lemma

[cf.

[NodNon],

that

Next,
let
us
observe
that,
by
applying
the
induction
hypothesis
to
β,
we
conclude
that
β
is
graphic.
Thus,
it
follows
immediately
—
in
light
of
[CmbGC],
Proposition
1.5,
(ii)
—
from
the
deﬁnition
of
the
generizations
under
consideration
[cf.

of

Proposition

that,
to
complete
the
veriﬁcation
of

it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
the
following
assertion
holds:

Claim
3.2.A:
Let

be
a

image
in

is
a

Then

is
a

To
verify
Claim
3.2.A,
let
us
observe
that
since
β
is
graphic,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
above
characterization
of

ΠY

that
β
maps
Πv0
bijectively
onto

Thus,
it
follows
immediately
from
condition

together
with

evident
isomorphism

In

one
concludes
that

Theorem
3.3
(Graphicity
of
proﬁnite
outer

Let

a
nonempty

prime
numbers;

∼

isomorphism
of

Then
the
following
conditions
are
equivalent:
(i)
The
outer
isomorphism
α
is
graphic
[cf.
[CmbGC],
Deﬁnition
1.4,
(i)].
(ii)
The
outer
isomorphism
α
is
group-theoretically
verticial
and
group-theoretically
cuspidal
[cf.
[CmbGC],
Deﬁnition

(iii)
The
outer
isomorphism
α
is
group-theoretically
nodal
[cf.
[NodNon],
Deﬁnition

and
group-theoretically
cuspidal.
Proof.
The
implication
(i)
⇒
(ii)
(respectively,
(ii)
⇒
(iii))
follows
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved
(respectively,
[NodNon],
Lemma

(i)).
Thus,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
the
implication
(iii)
⇒
(i).
Suppose
that
condition
(iii)
holds.
Then,
to
verify
the
graphicity
of
α,
it
follows
from
[CmbGC],
Theorem
1.6,

that
it
suﬃces
to
verify

ﬁltration-preserving

Moreover,
the

essentially,
a
restatement

a

Now

Let

immediately
from

Proof.
Assertion
(i)
follows
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions

Next,
we
verify
assertion
(ii).
Let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
the
inclusion
|βv

follows
immediately
from
the

of

morphism
Πtpd

,
together
with
the
second
displayed
equality
of
[CbTpII],
Theorem

(v).
The
inclusion
|βv
|
∈
OutC
(Πv

then
follows
from
[CbTpII],
Lemma
3.5;
[CbTpII],
Theorem

[applied
in
the

to

Moreover,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
various
definitions
involved
that
the
inclusion
|βv
|
∈
OutC
(Πv

allows
one
to
conclude
that
the

to
the
speciﬁc
geometric
outer
isomorphism
Πtpd

Πv
whose
existence
is
guaranteed
by
[CbTpII],
Theorem
3.18,
(ii).
In
the
following
∼
discussion,
we
ﬁx
this
speciﬁc
geometric
outer
isomorphism
Πtpd
→
Πv
.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
if
βv
=
|βv
|,
i.e.,
βv
∈
OutC
(Πv
)cusp
,
then
it
follows
immediately
from
[CbTpII],
Theorems
3.16,
(v);
3.18,
(ii),
that
TΠtpd
(β3
)
∈
Out(Πtpd
)
coincides
with
|βv
|
∈
Out(Πv
).
Thus,
to
complete
the
veriﬁcation
of
assertion
(ii),
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
βv
=
|βv
|,
i.e.,
that
βv
∈
OutC
(Πv
)cusp
.
Then
let
us
observe
that
collections
of
data
consisting
of
smooth
log
curves
that
[by
gluing
at
prescribed
cusps]
give
rise
to
a
stable
log
curve
whose
associated
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
[of
pro-Σ
PSC-type]
is
isomorphic
to
G
may
be
parametrized
by
a
smooth,
connected
moduli
stack.
Thus,
one
veriﬁes
easily
that,
by
considering
the
étale
fundamental
groupoid
of
this
moduli
stack,
together
with
a
suitable
scheme-theoretic
automorphism
of
order
2
of
a
collection
of
data
parametrized
by
this
moduli
stack,
one
obtains
a
3-cuspidalizable
automorphism
ξ
∈
Aut(G)
(→
Out(ΠG
))
of
G
such
that
ξv
[i.e.,
the
“αv
”
that
occurs
in
the
case
where
we
take
“α”
to
be
ξ]
coincides
with
ι.
Thus,
by
applying
the
portion
of
assertion
(ii)
that
has
already
been
veriﬁed
to
ξ
◦
β,
we
conclude
that,
to
complete
the
veriﬁcation
of
assertion
(ii),
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
TΠtpd
(ξ3
)
=
1.
On
the
other
hand,
this
follows
immediately
from
the
fact
that
ξ
was
assumed
to
arise
from
a
scheme-theoretic
automorphism
[cf.
also
[CbTpII],
Theorem
3.16,
(v)].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii)
and
hence
of
Lemma
3.7.

Deﬁnition
3.8.
Let
J
⊆
Π1
be
a
2-cuspidalizable
cycle-subgroup
[cf.
Deﬁnition
3.5,
(i),
(ii)];
let
us
ﬁx
associated
data
as
in
Deﬁnition
3.6,
(i),
(a),
(b),
(c),
(d).
Relative
to
this
data,
suppose
that
T
⊆
Π2/1
is
a
tripodal
subgroup
associated
to
J
⊆
Π1
[cf.
Deﬁnition
3.6,
(i)],
and
that
I
⊆
T
is
a
distinguished
cuspidal
subgroup
of
T
[cf.
Deﬁnition
3.6,
(ii)].
Note
that
this
data,
together
with
the
log
scheme
structure
of
Y
log
,
allows
one
to
speak
of
geometric
[cf.
[CbTpII],
Deﬁnition
3.4,
(ii)]
outomorphisms
of
T
.
Then
one
veriﬁes
easily
that
there
exists
a
uniquely
determined
nontrivial
geometric
outomorphism
of
T
that
preserves
the
T
-conjugacy
class
of
I.
Thus,
since
I
is
commensurably
terminal
in
T
[cf.
[CmbGC],
Proposition
1.2,
(ii)],
there
exists
a
uniquely
determined
I-conjugacy
class
of
automorphisms
of
T
that
lifts
this
outomorphism
and
preserves
I
⊆
T
.
We
shall
refer
to
this
I-conjugacy
class
of
automorphisms
of
T
as
the
cycle
symmetry
associated
to
I.
Before
proceeding,
we
pause

Thus,
the

J

it

Proof.
Assertion
(i)
follows
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved.
Next,
we
verify
assertion
(ii).
The
initial
portion
of
assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
the
discussion
of
Remark
3.6.1,
together
110
YUICHIRO
HOSHI
AND
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
with
the
fact
that
T
is
uniquely
determined
among
its
Π2/1
-conjugates
by
the
condition
I
⊆
T
[cf.
[CmbGC],
Proposition
1.5,
(i)].
The
ﬁnal
portion
of
assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
Lemma
3.1,
(ii)
[i.e.,
by
considering
a
suitable
generization
operation,
as
in
the
discussion
of
Remark
3.6.1].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Next,
we
verify
assertion
(iii).
Let
us
ﬁx
data
∼
∼
(Y
G,
S
⊆
Node(Y
G),
φ
:
Y
GS
→
G);
Y
Π1
→
Π1
;
Y
∼
Π2
→
Π2
;
Πe
⊆
Y
Π1
for
J
∈
Cyclen
(Π1
)
as
in
Deﬁnition
3.6,
(i),
(a),
(b),
(c),
(d),
and
let
Y
T
⊆
Y
Π2/1
be
a
{1,
2}-tripod
as
in
the
discussion
of
Deﬁnition
3.6,
(i).
Let
Y
Πtpd
⊆
Y
Π3
be
a
3-central
tripod
of
Y
Π3
.
Here,
we
note
that
since
J
∈
Cyclen
(Π1
),
and
n
≥
3,
it
follows
that
the
above
isomorphism
∼
∼
Y
Π2
→
Π2
lifts
to
a
PFC-admissible
isomorphism
Y
Π3
→
Π3
that
maps
Y
Πtpd
to
a
Π3
-conjugate
of
Πtpd
[cf.
[NodNon],
Theorem
B;
[CbTpII],
Theorem
3.16,
(v);
[CbTpII],
Remark
4.14.1].
Now
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that,
to
verify
the
existence
portion
of
assertion
(iii),
by
applying
a
suitable
generization
operation
as
in
the
discussion
of
Remark
3.6.1,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
Node(Y
G)
=
1
[an
assumption
that
will
be
invoked
when
we
apply
Lemma
3.7
in
the
argument
to
follow].
Then,
by
considering
the
geometric
[hence,
in
particular,
C-admissible]
outer
isomorphism
of
[CbTpII],
Theorem
3.18,
(ii),
in
the
case
where
we
take
the
“(T,
T

)”
of
[CbTpII],
Theorem
3.18,
(ii),
to
be
(Y
Πtpd
,
Y
T
),
we
obtain
an
outer
∼
isomorphism
Πtpd
→
CI
(J).
Moreover,
by
considering
the
composite
of
this
outer
isomorphism
with
a
suitable
geometric
outomorphism
of
Πtpd
,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
this
outer
iso∼
morphism
Πtpd
→
CI
(J)
maps
the
Πtpd
-conjugacy
class
of
Itpd
to
the
CI
(J)-conjugacy
class
of
I.
Thus,
since
I
is
commensurably
terminal
in
CI
(J)
[cf.
[CmbGC],
Proposition
1.2,
(ii)],
we
obtain
a
uniquely
de∼
termined
I-conjugacy
class
of
isomorphisms
synI,J
:
Πtpd
→
CI
(J)
that
lifts
the
outer
isomorphism
just
discussed
and
satisﬁes
condition
(a).
On
the
other
hand,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved
that
synI,J
also
satisﬁes
condition
(b).
Next,
we
verify
that
synI,J
satisﬁes
condition
(c).
To
this
end,
let
us
observe
that
it
follows
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved
[cf.
also
our
assumption
that
Node(Y
G)
=
1],
that
α1
(J)
admits
data
as
in
Deﬁnition
3.6,
(i),
(a),
(b),
(c),
(d),
such
that
•
the
portion
of
this
data
that
corresponds
to
the

of
Deﬁnition

(i),
(a),
(d),
is
of
the
form
∼
(Y
G,
S
⊆
Node(Y

ψ
:
Y
GS
→
G);
Πe
⊆
Y
Π1

some

ψ

where

(c)]
for
J
(respectively,
α1

Cyclen
(Π1
)
under
consideration
—
is
the
identity
automorphism.
Thus,
to
verify
the
assertion
that
synI,J
satisﬁes
condition
(c),
it
suﬃces
∼
to
verify
that
the
I-conjugacy
class
of
isomorphisms
“synI,J
:
Πtpd
→
CI
(J)”
constructed
above
from
a
ﬁxed
choice
of
data
as
in
Deﬁnition
3.6,
(i),
(a),
(b),
(c),
(d)
does
not
depend
on
this
choice
of
data.
On
the
other
hand,
this
follows
immediately
from
Lemma
3.7,
(ii)
[cf.
our
assumption
that
Node(Y
G)
=
1].
Finally,
we
consider
the
ﬁnal
portion
of
assertion
(iii)
concerning
uniqueness.
To
this
end,
we
observe
that,
by
considering
the
case
where
Y
G,
as
well
as
each
of
the
branches
of
the
underlying
semi-graph
of
Y
G,
is
deﬁned
over
a
number
ﬁeld
F
,
it
follows
immediately,
by
considering
automorphisms
α
∈
AutFC
(Πn
,
I)G
that
arise
from
scheme
theory,
that
given
any
element
γ
∈
Out(Πtpd
)
that
arises
from
an
element
of
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
F
,
there
exists
an
α
∈
AutFC
(Πn
,
I)G
such
that
α(J)
=
J
and
TΠtpd
(α)
=
γ.
Thus,
the
uniqueness
under
consideration
follows
immediately
from
the
geometricity
of
elements
of
Out(Πtpd
)
that
commute
with
the
image
of
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
F
,
i.e.,
in
other
words,
from
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
for
tripods
over
number
ﬁelds
[cf.
[Tama1],
Theorem
0.3;
[LocAn],
Theorem
A].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii).
Finally,
we
verify
assertion
(iv).
If
condition
(a)
is
satisﬁed,
then,
by
taking
the
“β”
of
assertion
(iv)
to
be
α,
we
conclude
that
assertion
(iv)
follows
immediately
from
assertion
(iii),
together
with
the
deﬁnition
of
OutFC
(Πn
)geo
.
Next,
let
us
observe
that,
by
applying
assertion
(iv)
in
the
case
where
condition
(a)
is
satisﬁed,
we
conclude
that,
to
verify
assertion
(iv)
in
the
case
where
either
(b)
or
(c)
is
satisﬁed,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
the
following
assertion
holds:

To

veriﬁes

Now
let
us
identify

Remark
3.10.1.
(i)
The
content
of
Theorem
3.10,
(iv),
may
be
regarded,
i.e.,
by
considering
the
various
lifting
cycle-subgroups
involved,
as
a
formulation
of
the
construction
of
the
two
sections
discussed
in
[Bgg2],
Proposition
2.7
[which
plays
an
essential
role
in
the
COMBINATORIAL
ANABELIAN
TOPICS

113
proof
of
[Bgg2],
Theorem
2.4],
in
terms
of
the
purely
combinatorial
and
algebraic
techniques
developed
in
the
present
series
of
papers.
(ii)
In
this
context,
we
observe
in
passing
that
[one
veriﬁes
immediately
that]
for
arbitrary
nonnegative
integers
g,
r
such
that
•
3g
−
3
+
r
>
0,
and,
moreover,
•
if
g
=
0,
then
r
is
even,
there
exists
a
stable
log
curve
of
type
(g,
r)
which
admits
an
automorphism
that
is
linear
over
the
base
scheme
under
consideration
and
ﬁxes
a
node
of
the
stable
log
curve,
but
switches
the
branches
of
this
node.
Thus,
by
considering
the
resulting
automorphism
of
the
associated
semi-graph
of
anabelioids
of
pro-Σ
PSC-type,
one
concludes
that
the
diagrams
of
Theorem
3.10,
(iii),
(iv),
fail
to
commute,
in
general,
if
one
does
not
allow
for
the
possibility
of
composition
with
a
cycle
symmetry.
This
situation
contrasts
with
the
situation
discussed
in
[Bgg2],
Proposition
2.7,
where
two
independent
sections
are
obtained,
by
considering
orientations
on
the
various
cycles
involved.
(iii)
The
orientation-theoretic
portion
of
[Bgg2],
Proposition
2.7,
referred
to
in
(ii)
above
may
be
interpreted,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
present
paper,
as
a
lifting
“C±

”
of
the
map
CI
of

One
veriﬁes
immediately
that
the

are
compatible,
in

Remark

One
veriﬁes
immediately
that
remarks
analogous
to

in
the
proﬁnite
case
may
be
made
in
the
discrete
situation
treated
in
Theorem

In
this
context,
we
observe
that
the
theory
of
the
“modules
of
local
orientations
Λ”
developed
in
[CbTpI],
§3,
admits
a
straightforward
discrete
analogue,
which
may
be
∼
applied
to
conclude
that
the
“orientation

”
of
Remark
3.6.2,
(i),
are
compatible
with
the
natural
discrete
structures
on

and
codomain.
Alternatively,
in
the
discrete
case,
relative
to
the
notation
of
Deﬁnition
2.2,
(iii),
one
may
think
of
these
modules
“Λ”
as
the

Appendix.
Explicit
limit
seminorms
associated
to
sequences
of
toric
surfaces
In
the
proof
of
Corollary
1.15,
(ii),
we
considered
sequences
of
discrete
valuations
that
arose
from
vertices
or
edges
of
the
dual
semigraphs
associated
to
the
geometric
special
ﬁbers
of
a
tower
of
coverings
of
stable
log
curves
and,
in
particular,
observed
that
the
convergence
of
a
suitable
subsequence
of
such
a
sequence
follows
immediately
from
the
general
theory
of
Berkovich
spaces.
In
the
present
Appendix,
we
reexamine
this
convergence
phenomenon
from
a
more
elementary
and
explicit
—
albeit
logically
unnecessary,
from
the
point
of
view
of
proving
Corollary
1.15,
(ii)!
—
point
of
view
that
only
requires
a
knowledge
of
elementary
facts
concerning
log
regular
log
schemes,
i.e.,
without
applying
the
terminology
and
notions
[e.g.,
of
“Stone-Čech
compactiﬁcations”]
that
frequently
appear
in
the
general
theory
of
Berkovich
spaces
[cf.
the
proof
of
[Brk1],
Theorem
1.2.1].
In
particular,
we
discuss
the
notion
of
a
“stratum”
of
a
“toric
surface”
[cf.
Deﬁnition
A.1
below],
which
generalizes
the
notion
of
a
vertex
or
edge
of
the
dual
graph
of
the
special
ﬁber
of
a
stable
curve
over
a
complete
discrete
valuation
ring.
We
observe
that
such
a
stratum
determines
a
discrete
valuation
[cf.
Deﬁnition
A.4]
and
consider,
at
a
quite
explicit
level,
the
limit
of
a
suitable
subsequence
of
a
given
sequence
of
such
discrete
valuations
[cf.
Theorem
A.7
below].
The
material
presented
in
this
Appendix
is
quite
elementary
and
“well-known”,
but
we
chose
to
include
it
in
the
present
paper
since
we
were
unable
to
ﬁnd
a
suitable
reference
that
discusses
this
material
from
a
similar
point
of
view.
In
the
present
Appendix,
let
R
be
a
complete
discrete
valuation
ring.
Write
K
for
the

of

obtained

We
shall
refer

the
following
conditions
are
satisﬁed:
(a)
The
underlying
scheme
X
of
X

is
of
ﬁnite
type,
ﬂat,
and
of
pure
relative
dimension
one
[i.e.,
every
irreducible
component
of
every
ﬁber
of
the
underlying
morphism
of
schemes
X
→
S
is
of
dimension
one]
over
S.
(b)
The
fs
log
scheme
X

is
log
regular.
(c)
The
interior
[cf.,
e.g.,
[MT],
Deﬁnition
5.1,
(i)]
of
the
log
scheme
X
log
is
equal
to
the
open
subscheme
X
×R
K
⊆

Given
two
toric
surfaces
over
S
log
,
there
is
an
evident
notion
of

of
toric

over

Let
X

be
a

over

[cf.

and
n
a

Write

and
X
[−1]

the

Observe
that

Finally,
given

there

Deﬁnition

Let
X

Thus,

We
shall

that

is
rational
(respectively,

if

(iii)
Let
L

be

[cf.

Then
we
shall
write
vL

for

associated
to
the

,
normalized
so
as
to
map
each
prime
element
πR
of

to

That
is
to
say,
if
λ

[which,
by
a
slight
abuse
of
notation,
we
regard
as
a

and
f

lies
in

then
vL

Here,
we
observe
that
[one
veriﬁes

that]
the
submonoid

In

if
we
denote

the

determined

may
be
described
explicitly
as

Indeed,
if
we

that
lie
in

then
it
follows
immediately
from
the

of

that
pL
is
the

of

in

and
that
the

U
is

Write

Then
one
veriﬁes

that
VR

coincide.
[Note
that
the
existence
of
such

eα

follows,
e.g.,
from

one
obtains

the

Lw
determined
by
this

of

as
the

associated
to
the

Thus,
if
Lw
is
rational
[cf.

then
it
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions
that,
in
the
notation
of

the

of

determined
by
w
extends
to
a

Remark
A..3.1.
In
the
notation
of
Deﬁnition
A.3,
the
usual

V
naturally
determines
a
topology
on
the

,
as
well
as
on
the

[i.e.,
which
may
be
regarded
as
the
complement
of
the
“zero

in
the
quotient
space
P/R≥0
].
Moreover,
one
veriﬁes
easily
that,
if
eα
and
eβ
are
as
in
Deﬁnition
A.3,

then
the

(γ

a

of

and
that
the

In

it

sense
to

Proof.
One
may
deﬁne
a
map
vL
:
F

→
R
by
applying
the
formula
in
the
display
of
condition
(c)
in
the
case
where
J


Then
one
veriﬁes
easily
that
this
map
vL
is
a

[with
respect
to
the
multiplicative

of

and
satisﬁes
condition
(b).
Next,
let
us
observe
that
since
[we
have
assumed
that]
L
is
irrational,
the
map
M
gp
→
R
determined
by
λ
∈

is
injective.
Thus,
it
follows
from
condition
(b),
together
with
the
fact
that
each
of
the
wi
’s
is
a
valuation,
that
the
map
vL
satisﬁes
condition
(c),
which
implies
that
the
map
vL
is
a
[necessarily
admissible]
valuation
on

Moreover,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of

that
vL
satisﬁes
condition

(Explicit

Let

a

that

Write

Finally,
these

that
is

with

of

over

and
a

collection
of
strata
[i.e.,
“{zi
}i∈I
”].
Proof.
Until
further
notice,
we
take,
for
each
i
∈
I,
vzi
to
be
the
canonical
valuation
associated
to
zi
[cf.
Deﬁnition
A.4].
Next,
let
us
observe
that
one
veriﬁes
easily
that
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality,
by
replacing
I
by
a
suitable
coﬁnal
subset
of
I,
that
there
exists
an
element
n
∈
{1,
2}
such
that
every
member
of
{zi
}
is
an
n-stratum,
i.e.,
one
of
the
following
conditions
is
satisﬁed:
(1)
Every
member
of
{zi
}
is
a
1-stratum.
(2)
Every
member
of
{zi
}
is
a
2-stratum.
First,
we
consider
Theorem
A.7
in
the
case
where
condition
(1)
is
satisﬁed.
For
each
i
∈
I,
write
Zi
⊆
Xi
for
the
reduced
closed
subscheme
of
Xi
whose
underlying
closed
subset
[⊆
Xi
]
is
the
closure
of
the
subset
of
X
determined
by
the
1-stratum
zi
.
Then
let
us
observe
that
if,
after
possibly
replacing
I
by
a
suitable
coﬁnal
subset
of
I,
it
holds
that,
for
each
i
∈
I,
the
composite
Zi+1
→
Xi+1
→
Xi
is
quasi-ﬁnite,
then
the
system
consisting
of
the
vzi
’s
[cf.
Deﬁnition
A.4,
(i)]
already
yields
a
system
of
valuations
{vi
}i∈I
as
desired.
Thus,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality,
by
replacing
I
by
a
suitable
coﬁnal
subset
of
I,
that,
for
each
i
∈
I,
the
composite
Zi+1
→
Xi+1
→
Xi
is
not
quasiﬁnite,
i.e.,
that
the
image
of
this
composite
is
a
closed
point
yi
∈
Xi
of
Xi
.
Here,
we
observe
that
since
we
are
operating
under
the
assumption
that
condition
(1)
is
satisﬁed,
it
follows
from
the
fact
that
zi+1
→
zi
that
yi
necessarily
lies
in
the
regular
locus
of
Xi
.
For
each
i
∈
I,
write
Bi
for
the
local
ring
of
Xi
at
yi
∈
Xi
,
Ei
for
the
ﬁeld
of
fractions
of
Bi
,
and
vzi
:
Ei×
→
R
for
the
discrete
valuation
deﬁned
in
Deﬁnition
A.4,
(i).
Thus,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
the
morphisms

.
Moreover,
if
πR
is
a
prime
element
of
R,
then
the
discrete
valuation
vzi
may
be
interpreted
as
the
discrete
valuation
of
Bi
determined
by
the
unique
height
one
prime
of
Bi
that
contains
πR
.
In
particular,
since
Bi
is
regular,
hence
a
unique
factorization
domain,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
—
by
considering
the
extent
to
which
positive
powers
of
an
element
f
∈
Bi
are
divisible,
in
Bi
or
in
Bi+1
,
by
positive
powers
of
πR
—
that,
for
each
i
∈
I
and
f
∈
Bi
,
it
holds
that
(0
≤)
vzi
(f
)
≤
vzi+1
(f
).
(∗)
For
each
i
∈
I,
write
def
pi
=
{
f
∈
Bi
|
lim
vzj
(f
)
=
+∞
}
⊆
Bi
.
j→∞
Then
since
each
vzj
is
a
[discrete]
valuation,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
pi
⊆
Bi
is
a
prime
ideal
of
Bi
.
Moreover,
since
πR
∈
pi
,
we
conclude
that
the
ideal
pi
is
not
maximal,
i.e.,
that
the
height
of
pi
is
∈
{0,
1}.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
if,
after
possibly
replacing
I
by
a
suitable
coﬁnal
subset
of
I,
it
holds
that,
for
each
i
∈
I,
the
prime
ideal
pi
is
of
height
1,
then
it
follows
immediately
that
pi
determines
a
closed
point
xi
of
the
generic
ﬁber
of
Xi
,
and
that,
if
we
write
Fi
for
the
residue
ﬁeld
of
Xi
at
xi
and
vi
:
Fi×
→
R
for
the
uniquely
determined
[since
Fi
is
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
K]
discrete
valuation
on
Fi
that
extends
the
given
discrete
valuation
on
K
and
maps
πR
→
1
∈
R,
then
the
limit
limj→∞
vzj
(−)
[cf.
(∗)]
determines
a
valuation
on
Fi
=
(Bi
)pi
/pi
(Bi
)pi
that
necessarily
coincides
[since
Fi
is
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
K]
with
vi
;
in
particular,
one
obtains
a
system
of
valuations
{vi
}i∈I
as
desired.
Thus,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality,
by
replacing
I
by
a
suitable
coﬁnal
subset
of
I,
that,
for
each
i
∈
I,
the
prime
ideal
pi
is
of
height
0,
i.e.,
pi
=
{0},
hence
determines
a
generic
point
xi
of
some
irreducible
component
of
Xi
such
that
Ei
may
be
naturally
identiﬁed
with
the
residue
ﬁeld
Fi
of
Xi
at
xi
.
But
this
implies
that,
for
f
∈
Ei×
=
Fi×
,
the
quantity
def
vi
(f
)
=
lim
vzj
(f
)
∈
R
j→∞
is
well-deﬁned
[cf.
(∗)].
Moreover,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
this
deﬁnition
of
vi
determines
a
valuation
on
Ei
=
Fi
.
In
particular,
one
obtains
a
system
of
valuations
{vi
}i∈I
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
Theorem
A.7
in
the
case
where
condition
(1)
is
satisﬁed.
Next,
we
consider
Theorem

map
Vi+1
→
Vi
is
an
isomorphism,
it
follows
immediately
from
Lemma
A.6,
together
with
Remark
A..3.1,
that,
for
each
i
∈
I,
the
sequence
consisting
of
the
images
in
Pi
of
the
midpoint
Pj
rays
[cf.
Deﬁnition
A.3,
(iv)],
where
j
ranges
over
the
elements
of
I
such
that
j
≥
i,
converges
to
a
[not
necessarily
rational]
Pi
-ray
Li,∞
⊆
Pi
.
If,
after
possibly
replacing
I
by
a
suitable
coﬁnal
subset
of
I,
it
holds
that,
for
each
i
∈
I,
the
Pi
-ray
Li,∞
is
rational,
then
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality,
by
taking
vzi
to
be
the
distinguished
valuation
associated
to
the
rational
Pi
-ray
Li,∞
[cf.
Deﬁnition
A.4,
(ii);
Remark
A..7.2
below]
and
then
replacing
the
pair
(Xi
,
zi
)
by
the
pair
consisting
of
the
blow-up
of
Xi
and
the
1-stratum
of
this
blow-up
determined
by
Li,∞
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Deﬁnition
A.3,
(iii)],
that
condition
(1)
is
satisﬁed.
Thus,
it
remains
to
consider
the
case
in
which
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality,
by
replacing
I
by
a
suitable
coﬁnal
subset
of
I,
that,
for
each
i
∈
I,
the
Pi
-ray
Li,∞
is
irrational.
Then
the
system
consisting
of
the
valuations
vLi,∞
’s
of
Lemma
A.5
yields
a
system
of
valuations
{vi
}i∈I
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
Theorem
A.7.

Remark
A..7.1.
In
the
situation
of
Theorem
A.7,
for
I
j
≥
i,
write
zji
for
the
irreducible
locally
closed
subset
of
Xi
determined
by
the
image
of
the
stratum
zj
in
Xi
.
Thus,
zji

⊆
zji
for
all
j

≥
j,
and
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
the
intersection
def
i
z∞
=
zji
j≥i
is
nonempty.
Moreover,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
constructions
i
discussed
in
the
proof
of
Theorem
A.7
that
if
ξi
∈
z∞
,
then
any
element

f
of
the
local
ring
OXi
,ξi
of
Xi
at
ξi
determines
a
rational
function
on
the
irreducible
component
of
Xi
containing
xi
that
is
regular
at
xi
[cf.
Theorem
A.7,
(c)].
Remark
A..7.2.
Although,
in
certain
cases
[cf.
the
ﬁnal
portion
of
the
proof
of
Theorem
A.7],
the
distinguished
valuation
vzi
in
the
statement
of
Theorem
A.7
is
not
necessarily
canonical,
the
system
of
valuations
{vi
}i∈I
obtained
in
Theorem
A.7
is
nevertheless
suﬃcient
[cf.
the
functoriality
discussed
in
the
ﬁnal
portion
of
Theorem
A.7]
to
derive
the
conclusion
of
Corollary
1.15,
(ii),
i.e.,
without
applying
the
theory
of
[Brk1].
