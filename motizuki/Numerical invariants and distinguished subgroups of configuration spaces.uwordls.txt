Abstract.
Let
Σ
be
a
set
of
prime
numbers
which
is
either
of
cardinality
one
or
equal
to
the
set
of
all
prime
numbers.
In
this
paper,
we
prove
that
various
objects
that
arise
from
the
geometry
of
the
conﬁguration
space
of
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
of
characteristic
zero
may
be
reconstructed
group-theoretically
from
the
pro-Σ
fundamental
group
of
the
conﬁguration
space.
Let
X
be
a
hyperbolic
curve
of
type
(g,
r)
over
a
ﬁeld
k
of
characteristic
zero.
Thus,
X
is
obtained
by
removing
from
a
proper
smooth
curve
of
genus
g
over
k
a
closed
subscheme
[i.e.,
the
“divisor
of
cusps”]
of
X
whose
structure
morphism
to
Spec(k)
is
ﬁnite
étale
of
degree
r;
2g
−
2
+
r
>
0.
Write
Xn
for
the
n-th
conﬁguration
space
associated
to
X,
i.e.,
the
complement
of
the
various
diagonal
divisors
in
the
ﬁber
product
over
k
of
n
copies
of
X.
Then,
when
k
is
algebraically
closed,
we
show
that
the
triple
(n,
g,
r)
and
the
generalized
ﬁber
subgroups
—
i.e.,
the
subgroups
that
arise
from
the
various
natural
morphisms
Xn
→
Xm
[m
<
n],
which
we
refer
to
as
generalized
projection
morphisms
—
of
the
pro-Σ
fundamental
group
Πn
of
Xn
may
be
reconstructed
group-theoretically
from
Πn
whenever
n
≥
2.
This
result
generalizes
results
obtained
previously
by
the
ﬁrst
and
third
authors
and
A.
Tamagawa
to
the
case
of
arbitrary
hyperbolic
curves
[i.e.,
without
restrictions
on
(g,
r)].
As
an
application,
in
the
case
where
(g,
r)
=
(0,
3)
and
n
≥
2,
we
conclude
that
there
exists
a
direct
product
decomposition
Out(Πn
)
=
GTΣ
×
Sn+3
—
where
we
write
“Out(−)”
for
the
group
of
outer
automorphisms
[i.e.,
without
any
auxiliary
restrictions!]
of
the
proﬁnite
group
in
parentheses
and
GTΣ
(respectively,
Sn+3
)
for
the
pro-Σ
Grothendieck-Teichmüller
group
(respectively,
symmetric
group
on
n
+
3
letters).
This
direct
product
decomposition
may
be
applied
to
obtain
a
simpliﬁed
purely
grouptheoretic
equivalent
deﬁnition
—
i.e.,
as
the
centralizer
in
Out(Πn
)
of
the
union
of
the
centers
of
the
open
subgroups
of
Out(Πn
)
—
of
GTΣ
.
One
of
the
key
notions
underlying
the
theory
of
the
present
paper
is
the
notion
of
a
pro-Σ
log-full
subgroup
—
which
may
be
regarded
as
a
sort
of
higher-dimensional
analogue
of
the
notion
of
a
pro-Σ
cuspidal
inertia
subgroup
of
a
surface
group
—
of
Πn
.
In
the
ﬁnal
section
of
the
present
paper,
we
show
that,
when
X
and
k
satisfy
certain
conditions
concerning
“weights”,
the
pro-l
log-full
subgroups
may
be
reconstructed
group-theoretically
from
the
natural
outer
action
of
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
k
on
the
geometric
pro-l
fundamental
group
of
Xn

Introduction
Let
(g,
r)
be
a
pair
of
nonnegative
integers
such
that
2g
−
2
+
r
>
0;
k
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld;
X
a
hyperbolic
curve
of
type
(g,
r)
over
k,
i.e.,
the
open
subscheme
of
a
proper
smooth
curve
of
genus
g
over
k
obtained
by
removing
r
closed
points.
In
the
following
discussion,
we
shall
write
“Π(−)
”
for
the
[log]
étale
fundamental
group
of
a
connected
locally
noetherian
[fs
log]
scheme
[for
some
choice
of
basepoint].
If
the
characteristic
of
k
is
zero,
then
ΠX
is
a
surface
group
[cf.
the
discussion
entitled
“Topological
Groups”
in
§0];
in
particular,
if
r
>
0,
then
ΠX
is
a
free
proﬁnite
group
of
rank
2g
+
r
−
1.
Thus,
at
least
in
the
case
of
k
of
characteristic
zero,
the
isomorphism
class
of
the
proﬁnite
group
ΠX
is
insuﬃcient
to
determine
(g,
r).
[Note
that,
if
the
characteristic
of
k
is
positive,
then
the
isomorphism
class
of
ΠX
completely
determines
(g,
r)
—
cf.
[Tama],
Theorem
0.1.]
On
the
other
hand,
if,
instead
of
just
considering
the
étale
fundamental
group
of
the
given
hyperbolic
curve,
one
considers
the
étale
fundamental
groups
of
the
various
conﬁguration
spaces
associated
to
the
hyperbolic
curve,
then
the
following
Fact
is
known
[cf.
[CbTpI],
Theorem
1.8;
[MT],
Corollary
6.3]:
Fact.
Let
Σ
be
a
set
of
prime

which
is
either
of

For

a

and
the
set

Here,
we
recall

In
this
paper,
we
ﬁrst
generalize
the
above
Fact
to
include
the
case
of
arbitrary
hyperbolic
curves
[cf.
Theorem
2.5
for
more
details]:
Theorem
A.
(Group-theoreticity
of
the
dimension,
genus,
number
of
cusps,
and
generalized
ﬁber
subgroups).
Let
Σ
be
a
set
of
prime
numbers
which
is
either
of
cardinality
one
or
equal
to
the
set
of
all
prime
numbers.
For

∈
{◦,
•},
let
X

be
a
hyperbolic
curve
of
type
(g

,
r
)
over
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
of
characteristic
zero;
n
a
positive
integer;
Xn
the
n

conﬁguration
space
of
X

;
Π
the
maximal
pro-Σ

of
n
ΠX

;
n
∼
α
:
Π◦n◦
→
Π•n•
an
isomorphism
of
proﬁnite
groups.
Then
the
following
hold:
def
(i)
The
equality
n◦
=
n•
holds.
Moreover,
if
n
=
n◦
=
n•
≥
2,
then
(g
◦
,
r◦
)
=
(g
•
,
r•
).
(ii)
If
n
≥
2
[cf.
(i)],
then
α
induces
a
bijection
between
the
set
of
generalized
ﬁber
subgroups
of
Π◦n
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.1,
(ii)]
and
the
set
of
generalized
ﬁber
subgroups
of
Π•n
.
Here,
note
that
Theorem
A,
(ii),
fails
to
hold
if
one
uses
[“classical”]
ﬁber
subgroups
instead
of
generalized
ﬁber
subgroups.
Indeed,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.1,
(i);
Remark
2.1.1]
that
the
following
holds:
Let
n
≥
2
be
a
positive
integer;
Xn
the
n-th
conﬁguration
def
space
of
X;
Πn
=
ΠXn
.
Suppose
that
(g,
r)
∈
{(0,
3),
(1,
1)}.
Then
for
any
[“classical”]
ﬁber
subgroup
F
⊆
Πn
,
there
exists
an
automorphism
α
∈
Aut(Πn
)
—
which
arises
from
an
kautomorphism
∈
Autk
(Xn
)
—
such
that
α(F
)
⊆
Πn
is
not
a
[“classical”]
ﬁber
subgroup
of
Πn
.
We
also
remark
that,
in
Theorem
2.5,
below,
we
give
explicit
group-theoretic
algorithms
for
reconstructing
the
triple
(n,
g,
r),
as
well
as
the
generalized
ﬁber
subgroups
of
Πn
,
from
Πn
.
Next,
we
apply
Theorem
A,
(ii),
to
prove
the
following
result
[cf.
Corollary
2.6
for
more
details].
This
result
may
be
regarded
as
a
generalization
of
[CbTpII],
Theorem
B,
(i),
to
the
case
of
arbitrary
hyperbolic
curves.

(Structure

a

if
(g,

∈

{(0,

Sn∗
the
symmetric

on

Write
Out(Πn
)
for
the
group
of
outer
automorphisms
[i.e.,
without
any
auxiliary
restrictions!]
of
the
proﬁnite
group
Πn
.
Let
us
regard
Sn∗
as
a
subgroup
of
Out(Πn
)
via
the
natural
inclusion
Sn∗
→
Out(Πn
)
induced
by
the
natural
action
of
Sn∗
on
Xn
[cf.
Remark
2.1.1].
Suppose
that
(r,
n)
=
(0,
2).
Then
we
have
an
equality
Out(Πn
)
=
OutgF
(Πn
)
×
Sn∗
—
where
we
write
OutgF
(Πn
)
for
the
group
of
outer
automorphisms
of
Πn
that
stabilize
arbitrary
generalized
ﬁber
subgroups
of
Πn
.
In
this
context,
we
remark
that,
in
Corollaries
2.6,
(ii);
2.10,
(iv),
below,
we
give
explicit
group-theoretic
algorithms
for
reconstructing
the
subgroup
Sn∗
⊆
Out(Πn
)
from
Πn
.
In
particular,
by
restricting
Corollary
B
to
the
case
where
(g,
r)
=
(0,
3),
we
obtain
the
following
result
[cf.
Corollary
2.8
for
more
details]:
Corollary
C.
(Simpliﬁed
group-theoretic
approach
to
the
proΣ
Grothendieck-Teichmüller
group).
In
the
notation
of
Corollary
B,
suppose
that
(g,
r)
=
(0,
3).
Then
OutgF
(Πn
)
may
be
naturally
identiﬁed
with
the
pro-Σ
Grothendieck-Teichmüller
group
GTΣ
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.7].
In
particular,
we
have
an
equality
Out(Πn
)
=
GTΣ
×
Sn+3
.
Moreover,
we
have
Sn+3
=
ZOut(Πn
)
(GTΣ
)
=
Z
loc
(Out(Πn
)),
GTΣ
=
ZOut(Πn
)
(Z
loc
(Out(Πn
)))
—
where
we
write
Z
loc
(Out(Πn
))
for
the
local
center
of
Out(Πn
)
[cf.
the
discussion
entitled
“Topological
Groups”
in
§0].
Before
proceeding,
it
is
perhaps
of
interest
to
consider
the
signiﬁcance
of
Corollary
C
in
the
broader
context
of
the
considerations
that
motivated
the
introduction
of
the
Grothendieck-Teichmüller
group
GT
[i.e.,
GTΣ
,
in
the
case
where
Σ
is
taken
to
be
the
set
of
all
prime
numbers].
Let
Q
be
an
def
algebraic
closure
of
Q.
Write
GQ
=
Gal(Q/Q).
Thus,
for
a
suitable
choice
of
basepoints,
one
has
an
embedding
GQ
→
GT
(⊆
Out(Πn
))
[cf.,
e.g.,
[NodNon],
Theorem
C].
Indeed,
historically,
one
of
the
main
motivating
reasons
for
the
introduction
of
GT
was
the
point
of
view
that,
relative
to
the
above
embedding,
NUMERICAL
INVARIANTS
AND
DISTINGUISHED
SUBGROUPS
5
GT
should
serve
as
a
sort
of
purely
combinatorially/grouptheoretically
deﬁned
approximation
of
GQ
.
That
is
to
say,
the
conditions
used
to
deﬁne
GT
were
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“ﬁrst
approximation”
for
[still
unknown]
conditions
for
describing
GQ
as
a
subgroup
of
Out(Πn
).
Thus,
when
regarded
from
this
point
of
view,
Corollary
C
may
be
interpreted
as
asserting
that
this
approach
to
regarding
GT
as
a
“ﬁrst
approximation”
to
the
goal
of
describing
GQ
as
a
subgroup
of
Out(Πn
)
is
fundamentally
ﬂawed,
in
the
sense
that
GT,
up
to
a
“trivial
ﬁnite
factor”
given
by
the
symmetric
group
Sn+3
,
already
essentially
coincides
with
Out(Πn
).
In
fact,
GT,
when
regarded
as
a
“ﬁrst
approximation”
of
GQ
as
a
subgroup
of
Out(Πn
),
is
also
fundamentally
ﬂawed
in
a
somewhat
deeper,
more
philosophical
sense,
as
follows:
The
conventional
approach
to
deﬁning
GT
[cf.
the
discussion
of
Deﬁnition
2.7
for
more
details]
involves
the
use
of
(S1)
the
inertia
subgroups
⊆
Πn
associated
to
the
various
log
divisors
of
Xnlog
[cf.
the
discussion
entitled
“Curves”
in
§0]
and
(S2)
the
subgroup
Sn+3
⊆
Out(Πn
)
of
Corollaries
B,
C.
Here,
we
note
that,
at
least
at
an
a
priori
level,
both
(S1)
and
(S2)
are
data
that
arise
from
[characteristic
zero]
scheme
theory,
i.e.,
scheme
theory
over
Q.
That
is
to
say,
this
state
of
aﬀairs
—
i.e.,
in
which
GT
is
deﬁned
within
Out(Πn
)
by
means
of
conditions
that
involve
data
that
arise
from
scheme
theory
over
Q
—
is
fundamentally
philosophically
inconsistent
with
the
goal
of
giving
purely
combinatorial/group-theoretic
conditions
—
i.e.,
conditions
that
are
independent
of
scheme
theory
over
Q
—
for
describing
GQ
[whose
construction
is
immediate,
once
one
allows
the
construction
to
depend
in
a
quite
essential
fashion
on
scheme
theory
over
Q!]
as
a
subgroup
of
Out(Πn
).
Here,
we
note
that,
of
course,
one
can
attempt
to
avoid
scheme
theory
in
the
construction
of
the
data
(S1),
(S2)
by
base-changing
via
some
embedding
ι
:
Q
→
C
and
then
constructing
the
data
(S1),
(S2)
via
techniques
from
classical
topology.
On
the
other
hand,
this
yields
a
deﬁnition
of
GT
that
depends
essentially
on
the
choice
of
the
embedding
ι
:
Q
→
C,
i.e.,
the
choice
of
an
archimedean
valuation
of
Q.
In
order
to
eliminate
this
dependence,
one
must
employ
some
sort
of
“analytic
continuation
apparatus”
to
relate
the
constructions
of
the
data
(S1),
(S2)
at
diﬀerent
archimedean
valuations
of
Q.
The
conventional
approach
to
resolving
this
issue
is
to
take
the
“analytic
continuation
apparatus”
to
be
the
“paths”
[i.e.,
between
the
étale
fundamental
groups
associated
to
diﬀerent
basepoints]
that
arise
from
the
theory
of
[SGA1].
On
the
other
hand,
such
“[SGA1]
paths”
[i.e.,
this
theory
of
[SGA1]]
are
themselves
fundamentally
dependent
on
scheme
theory
over
Q,

the
point
of
view
of
the
goal
of
obtaining
a
deﬁnition
of
GT
that
is
independent
of
scheme
theory
over
Q.
[Indeed,
here
it
is
perhaps
useful
to
recall
that
the
subgroup
of
Out(Πn
)
determined
by
GQ
is
precisely
the
monodromy
that
arises
from
such
“[SGA1]
paths”!]
That
is
to
say,
the
only
way
to
avoid
a
dependence
on
scheme
theory
[over
Q]
is
to
regard
the
various
proﬁnite
groups
that
are
constructed,
say,
at
distinct
archimedean
valuations
of
Q
as
mathematical
objects
that
tautologically
cannot
be
related
to
one
another
by
means
of
scheme
theory
[over
Q],
i.e.,
that
can
only
be
related
to
one
another
as
abstract
proﬁnite
groups.
This
sort
of
“wall
that
tautologically
obstructs
scheme
theory”
is
precisely
the
sort
of
situation
that
arises
in
the
theory
of
the
log-wall/log-link
that
appears
in
inter-universal
Teichmüller
theory
[cf.
[AbsTopIII],
§I4;
[AbsTopIII],
Remark
3.7.7;
the
discussion
at
the
beginning
of
[Pano],
§4].
Here,
we
recall
that
once
one
takes
this
point
of
view
of
“inter-universal
analytic
continuation”,
one
can
no
longer
regard
the
abstract
proﬁnite
group
“Πn
”
as
being
“equipped
with
auxiliary
data
of
scheme-theoretic
origin”
such
as
(S1),
(S2),
i.e.,
one
must
regard
“Πn
”
simply
as
“some
abstract
proﬁnite
group”.
Thus,
in
the
context
of
the
present
discussion,
[the
theory
surrounding]
Corollary
C
asserts
that
even
if
one
just
regards
“Πn
”
simply
as
“some
abstract
proﬁnite
group”,
there
exist
purely
combinatorial/group-theoretic
algorithms
[i.e.,
that
are
entirely
free
of
any
dependence
on
data
that
arises
from
scheme
theory!]
for
constructing
the
data
(S1),
(S2),
hence
also
for
constructing
GT,
from
the
abstract
proﬁnite
group
Πn
.
In
our
proof
of
the
equality
“n◦
=
n•
”
stated
in
Theorem
A,
(i),
we
focus
on
a
certain
special
kind
of
point
—
called
a
log-full
point
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1.1]
—
of
[the
underlying
scheme
of]
the
log
conﬁguration
space
of
a
stable
log
curve
that
gives
rise
to
the
given
hyperbolic
curve
[cf.
the
discussion
entitled
“Curves”
in
§0].
Roughly
speaking,
a
log-full
point
is
deﬁned
to
be
a
closed
point
of
the
log
conﬁguration
space
at
which
the
log
structure
is
the
“most
concentrated”.
For
instance,
if
X
log
is
a
stable
log
curve
over
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
equipped
with
an
fs
log
structure,
then
the
set
of
log-full
points
of
X
log
coincides
with
the
set
of
cusps
and
nodes
of
X
log
.
In
particular,
the
notion
of
a
log-full
point
of
the
log
conﬁguration
space
of
a
stable
log
curve
may
be
considered
as
a
sort
of
higher-dimensional
analogue
of
the
notion
of
a
cusp/node.
In
the
following
discussion,
for
simplicity,
we
consider
the
case
of
smooth
curves.
Let
l
be
a
prime
number;
Σ
a
set
of
prime
numbers
which
is
equal
to
either
{l}
or
the
set
of
all
prime
numbers;
k
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
of
characteristic
∈
/
Σ;
X
log
→
Spec(k)
NUMERICAL
INVARIANTS
AND
DISTINGUISHED
SUBGROUPS
7
a
stable
log
curve
[i.e.,
where
we
regard
“Spec(k)”
as
being
equipped
with
the
trivial
log
structure]
such
that
the
interior
[i.e.,
the
open
subscheme
of
points
at
which
the
log
structure
of
X
log
is
trivial]
of
X
log
is
aﬃne.
Then
let
us
recall
that
a
cusp
of
X
log
determines
[up
to
conjugation]
Σ
an
inertia
subgroup
⊆
ΠΣ
X
log
[noncanonically]
isomorphic
to
Z
—
where
we
write
(−)Σ
for
the
maximal
pro-Σ
quotient
of
a
proﬁnite
group
(−).
In
a
similar
vein,
if
n
is
a
positive
integer,
then
a
log-full
point
of
the
n-th
log
conﬁguration
space
Xnlog
of
X
log
determines
[up
to
conjugation]
what
we
shall
refer
to
[cf.
Deﬁnition
3.4]
as
def

Σ
)⊕n
.
[noncanonically]
isomorphic
to
(Z
a
log-full
subgroup
⊆
Πn
=
ΠΣ
X
log
n
Here,
we
observe
that
the
dimension
“n”
appears
as
the
rank
of
a
log-full
subgroup.
Thus,
a
log-full
subgroup
may
be
regarded
as
a
sort
of
grouptheoretic
manifestation
of
the
dimension.
In
fact,
this
point
of
view
plays
an
important
role
in
the
proof
of
Theorem
1.6.
The
notion
of
a
log-full
subgroup
also
plays
an
important
role
in
our
approach
to
the
following
Problem:
Problem.
Can
one
give

Topological

introduced
in

that,
in

This

Theorem

also
implies
that,

Π
(iv)
The
[outer]
homomorphism
ιΔ
xn
is
injective.
In
particular,
ιxn
is
also
injective.
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
To
verify
the
inequalities,
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
0
≤
rk(Pn/n−1,xn
)
≤
1
—
where
we
write
Pn/n−1
for
the
groupiﬁcation
of
the
relative
characteristic
log
of
Xnlog
→
Xn−1
.
But
this
follows
immediately
from
[KF],
Lemma
1.4.
Here,
note
that
rk(Pn/n−1,xn
)
=
0
(respectively,
rk(Pn/n−1,xn
)
=
1)
holds
if
/
E((Xnlog

)
(respectively,
xn
∈
E((Xnlog

))
[cf.
[KF],
and
only
if
xn
∈
Lemma
1.6;
[KF],
Proof
of
Theorem
1.3].
This
completes
the
proof
assertion
(i).
Assertion
(ii)
is
an
immediate
consequence
of
assertion
(i).
Assertion
(iii)
follows
from
[Hsh],
Proposition
B.5.
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iv).
First,
we
verify
the
case
n
=
1.
Suppose
that
x1
∈
/
E(X
log
).
Then
since
Δ
x1
∼
=
{1}
[cf.
assertions
(i),
(iii)],
it
follows
that
ιΔ
x1
is
injective.
Thus,
we
may
assume
that
x1
∈
E(X
log
).
Then
the
injectivity
of
ιΔ
x1
follows
from
[the
evident
pro-Σ
generalization
of]
[SemiAn],
Proposition
2.5,
(i)
[cf.
also
[CmbGC],
Remark
1.1.3].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iv)
in
the
case
n
=
1.
Thus,
it
remains
to
verify
assertion
(iv)
in
the
case
n
≥
2.
To
log
this
end,
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
the
projection
morphism
Xnlog
→
Xn−1
induces
[outer]
surjections
Δn

Δn−1
;
Δxn

Δxn−1
—
where
“Δn−1
”,
“Δxn−1
”
are
deﬁned
in
the
same
manner
as
“Δn
”,
“Δxn
”,
respectively.
Write
def
def
Δn/n−1
=
Ker(Δn

Δn−1
);
Δxn
/xn−1
=
Ker(Δxn

Δxn−1
).
Thus,
we
have
a
commutative
diagram
of
[outer]
homomorphisms
of
proﬁnite
groups
as
follows:

—
where
the
horizontal
sequences
are
exact,
and
ιΔ
xn−1
(respectively,
ιn/n−1
)
log
is
the
[outer]
homomorphism
induced
by
the
natural
inclusion
xlog
n−1
→
Xn−1
(respectively,
induced
by
the
[outer]
homomorphism
ιΔ

).
[Here,
we
recall
that
the
image
of
ιn/n−1
is
commensurably
terminal
in
Δn/n−1
[cf.
[CmbGC],
Proposition
1.2,
(ii)].
This
implies
that
ιn/n−1
is
well-deﬁned
as
an
outer
homomorphism.]
On
the
other
hand,
since

one
may

with
the
“ιΔ

”
induced
by
the
natural
inclusion
log
xlog
n
→
(Xn

,
it
follows
[from
the
case
n
=

that
ιn/n−1
is
injective.
Therefore,
by
induction
on
n,
we
conclude
that

In

the

hold:
(i)
xn

if

only
if

(iii)
If

∈

is
log-full,
then
Δxn
∼

Proof.
First,
we
verify
assertion
(i).
Fix
a
clean
chart
P
→
k
of
S
log
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Hsh],
Deﬁnition
B.1,
(ii)].
Write
T
log
for
the
log
scheme
whose
underlying
scheme
is
Spec(k[[P
]]),
and
whose
log
structure
is
deﬁned
by
the
natural
inclusion
P
→
k[[P
]];
S
log
→
T
log
for
the
[strict]
closed
immersion
determined
by
the
maximal
ideal
of
k[[P
]].
Thus,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
well-known
deformation
theory
of
stable
log
curves
that
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
there
exists
a
stable
log
curve
Y
log
→
T
log
whose
base-change
via
S
log
→
T
log
is
isomorphic
to
[hence
may
be
identiﬁed
with]
X
log
→
S
log
.
Write
Ynlog
for
the
n-th
log
conﬁguration
space
of
Y
log
.
Since
T
log
is
log
regular
[cf.
[KK2],
Deﬁnition
2.1],
and
Ynlog
→
T
log
is
log
smooth,
it
follows
that
Ynlog
is
also
log
regular
[cf.
[KK2],
Theorem
8.2].
Thus,
we
obtain
an
equality
(∗n
)
dim(OYn
,xn
)
=
dim(OYn
,xn
/I(xn
,
MYn
))
+
rk(Qn,xn

—
where
we
regard
xn
as
a
geometric
point
of
Yn
;
Qn
denotes
the
groupiﬁcation
of
the
characteristic
of
Ynlog
[cf.
[KK2],
Deﬁnition
2.1].
On
the
other
hand,
it
follows
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved
that
we
have
equalities
dim(OYn
,xn
)
=
dim(OT,x0
)
+
n,
rk(Qn,xn
)
=
dim(OT,x0
)
+
rk(Pn,xn
).
—
where
we
regard
x0
as
a
geometric
point
of
T
.
Combining
these
equalities
with
(∗n
),
we
obtain
an
equality
dim(OYn
,xn
/I(xn
,
MYn
))
=
n
−
rk(Pn,xn
).
Thus,
since
dim(OXn
,xn
/I(xn
,
MXn
))
=
dim(OYn
,xn
/I(xn

MYn
)),
we
conclude
that
xn
∈
Xn
is
log-full
if
and
only
if
rk(Pn,xn
)
=
n.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Assertion
(ii)
follows
from
assertion
(i)
and
the
fact
that
rk(Pn,xn
)
=
n
implies
rk(Pn−1,xn−1
)
=

Proposition
1.4.
(Abelian
closed
subgroups
of
a
pro-l

Let
l
be
a
prime
number;
G
a
pro-l
surface
group.
Then
every
nontrivial
abelian
closed
subgroup
of
G
is
isomorphic

Proof.
Let

G
be
a
nontrivial
abelian
closed
subgroup
of
G.
Here,
note
that
H
is
of
inﬁnite
index
in
G.
[Indeed,
this
follows
from
the
fact
that
every
open
subgroup
of
G
is
also
a
pro-l
surface
group,
hence
nonabelian.]
Thus,
it
follows
from
the
well-known
fact
that
the
l-cohomological
dimension
of
a
closed
inﬁnite
index
subgroup
of
a
pro-l
surface
group
is
≤
1
[cf.,

of
[MT],
Theorem
1.5]
that
H
is
a
free
pro-l
group
[cf.
[RZ],
Theorem
7.7.4].
Since
H
(=
{1})
is
abelian,

(Upper

Let
l
be
a

a

X
a

a

such
that

Then
the
inequality
s≤n
holds.
Proof.
Let
us
prove
the
inequality
by
induction
on
n.
When
n
=
1,
the
inequality
follows
from
Proposition
1.4.
Now
suppose
that
n
≥
2,
and
that
the
induction
hypothesis
is
in
force.
Write
p

the

surjection
induced
by
the

obtained
by
forgetting
the

Then,
by
Proposition
1.4,
it
follows
that
either
p(H)
=
{1}
or
p(H)
∼
=
Zl
.

In
particular,
H

satisﬁes
either

Here,
we
note
that
Ker(p)
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
maximal

of
the

some

of

[cf.

Thus,
by
applying
the

hypothesis,
we
obtain
that
either
s
≤

s

implies
that

Theorem
1.6.
(Group-theoretic
characterization
of
the

of

space).
Let
l
be
a
prime
number;
n
a
positive
integer;
X
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
k
of

=

def
Xn

Πn

.
Then
the
following
equality
holds:
n
=
max{s
∈
N
|
∃a
closed
subgroup
of
Πn
which
is
isomorphic
to
Z⊕s
l
}.
Proof.
In
light
of
Lemma
1.5,
to
verify
the
assertion,
it
suﬃces
to
show
the
following
claim:
There
exists
a
closed
subgroup
H
of
Πn
such
that
H
∼
=
Z⊕n
l
.
Thus,
we
proceed
to
verify
this
claim.
First,
we
observe
that,
by
applying
a
suitable
specialization
isomorphism
[cf.
the
discussion
preceding
[CmbCusp],
Deﬁnition
2.1,
as
well
as
[CbTpI],
Remark
5.6.1],
one
may
conclude
that
there
exists
a
stable
log
curve
Z
log
→
S
log
,
where
S
is
the
spectrum
of
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
of
characteristic
=
l,
and
we
write
Znlog
for
the
n-th
log
conﬁguration
space
of
Z
log
,
satisfying
the
following
properties:
E(Z
log
)
=
∅,
Ker(π1
(Z
log
)
→
π1
(S
log
))(l)
∼
=
Πn
.
n
[Here,
we
note
that,
although
the
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
“k◦
=
k”
of
the
discussion
preceding
[CmbCusp],
Deﬁnition
2.1,
is
assumed
to
be
of
characteristic
zero,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that,
if
one
restricts
one’s
attention
to
pro-l
fundamental
groups,
then
this
discussion
generalizes
immediately
to
the
case
where
“k◦
=
k”
is
of
characteristic
=
l.]
Thus,
by
applying
Propositions
1.2,
(i);
1.3,
(i),
it
follows
that
there
exists
a
log-full
point
zn
∈
Zn
.
In
particular,
by
applying
Proposition
1.3,
(iii)
to
zn
,
we
conclude
that
there
exists
a
closed
subgroup
H
of
Πn
such
that
H
∼
=
Z⊕n
l
.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
claim,
hence
also
of
Theorem

[cf.

Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
We
begin
by
verifying
the
exactness
of
ab/1
the
sequence
of
the
ﬁrst
display
in
the
statement
of
assertion
(i).
Write
Πn
for
the
quotient
of
Πn
by
the
kernel
of
the
natural
surjection
Πn/1

Πab
n/1
.
Thus,
we
have
a
tautological
exact
sequence
1
/
Πab
n/1
/
Πab/1
n
/
Π1
/
1.
Next,
recall
from
the
well-known
structure
theory
of
surface
groups
that
Π1
is
a
free
pro-l
group.
Thus,
the
exact
sequence
of
the
preceding
display
ab/1
admits
a
splitting
s
:
Π1
→
Πn
.
Now
we
claim
that
Claim
2.2A:
The
natural
conjugation
action
of
Π1
on
Πab
n/1
is
trivial.
Note
that
the
exactness
of
the
sequence
of
the
ﬁrst
display
in
the
statement
of
assertion
(i)
follows
formally
from
Claim
2.2A,
together
with
the
existence
ab/1
of
the
splitting
s
:
Π1
→
Πn
.
To
verify
Claim
2.2A,
we
reason
as
follows.
Let
K
be
an
algebraic
closure
def
of
the
function
ﬁeld
K
of
X.
Thus,
the
geometric
ﬁber
Z
=
X2
×X
Spec(K)
of
the
ﬁrst
projection
X2
→
X
is
a
hyperbolic
curve
of
genus
0
over
K.
For
simplicity,
we
assume
that
K
has
been
chosen
so
that
Π1
may
be
regarded
as
a
quotient
of
the
Galois
group
Gal(K/K).
Now
observe
that
the
(n−1)-st
conﬁguration
space
Zn−1
of
Z
may
be
naturally
identiﬁed
with
the
geometric
ﬁber
Xn
×X
Spec(K)
of
the
ﬁrst
projection
Xn
→
X,
and
hence
that
Πn/1
may
be
regarded
as
the
maximal
pro-l
quotient
of
the
étale
fundamental
group
of
Zn−1
.
Since
Z
is
of
genus
0,
it
follows
that
Zn−1
embeds
as
an
open
subvariety
of
the
ﬁber
product
over
K
of
n
−
1
copies
of
the
projective
line
P1K
over
K.
Since
the
étale
fundamental
group
of
such
a
ﬁber
product
is
well-known
to
be
trivial,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
Zariski-Nagata
20

AND

purity
theorem
that
Πn/1
is
topologically
normally
generated
by
the
inertia
subgroups
⊆
Πn/1
associated
to
the
various
log
divisors
[cf.
the
discussion
entitled
“Curves”
in
§0]
of
Zn−1
.
Moreover,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
each
such
log
divisor
DZ
arises,
by
base-changing
via
the
natural
morphism
Spec(K)
→
X,
from
some
log
divisor
DX
of
Xn
[where
we
regard
Xn
as
an
object
over
X
by
means
of
the
ﬁrst
projection
Xn
→
X]
that
corresponds
to
a
discrete
valuation
v
of
the
function
ﬁeld
of
Xn
that
induces
the
trivial
valuation
of
K.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
it
follows
immediately
from
the
well-known
geometry
of
moduli
stacks
of
pointed
stable
curves
of
genus
0
that
K
embeds
as
a
subﬁeld
of
the
residue
ﬁeld
L
of
the
discrete
valuation
ring
Ov
determined
by
v
which
is
algebraically
closed
in
L.
[Indeed,
the
log
divisor
DX
may
be
identiﬁed
with
a
suitable
ﬁber
product
over
k
of
log
conﬁguration
spaces
associated
to
smooth
log
curves
of
genus
0
over
k.
Moreover,
the
morphism
from
DX
to
the
unique
[up
to
isomorphism]
compactiﬁcation
of
X
induced
by
the
ﬁrst
projection
Xn
→
X
is
easily
seen
to
coincide
with
the
[manifestly
geometrically
connected!]
projection
morphism
that
arises
from
one
of
the
projection
morphisms
associated
to
one
of
the
log
conﬁguration
spaces
that
appears
in
such
a
ﬁber
product
over
k.]
Thus,
the
image
IZ
⊆
Πab
n/1
of
any
inertia
subgroup
⊆
Πn/1
associated
to
DZ
may
be
thought
of
as
the
image
⊆
Πab
n/1
of
the
maximal
pro-l
quotient
∼
Gv
(=
Zl
)
of
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
the
quotient
ﬁeld
of
some
strict
henselization
of
Ov
,
whose
residue
ﬁeld
we
denote
by
L.
Here,
we
observe
that
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
L,
K,
and
K
are
subﬁelds
of
L
such
that
L
∩
K
=
K
[so
Gal(K/K)
may
be
regarded
as
a
quotient
of
Gal(L/L)].
Since
the
natural
conjugation
action
of
Gal(L/L)
on
Gv
is
the
action
via
the
cyclotomic
character
[hence
factors
through
the
quotients
Gal(L/L)

Gal(K/K)

Π1
],
it
follows
from
the
fact
that
k
is
algebraically
closed
that
this
natural
conjugation
action
is
trivial,
hence
that
the
natural
conjugation
action
of
Π1
[which
we
regard
as
a
quotient
of
Gal(L/L)!]
on
ab
IZ
⊆
Πab
n/1
is
trivial.
Since
[cf.
the
above
discussion]
Πn/1
is
topologically
generated
by
such
subgroups
IZ
⊆
Πab
n/1
,
we
thus
conclude
that
the
natural
ab
conjugation
action
of
Π1
on
Πn/1
[cf.
Claim
2.2A]
is
trivial.
This
completes
the
proof
of
Claim
2.2A.
The
ﬁnal
portion
of
assertion
(i)
now
follows
formally,
by
induction
on
n,
from
the
exactness
of
the
sequence
of
the
ﬁrst
display
in
the
statement
of
assertion
(i),
together
with
the
well-known
structure
theory
of
surface
groups.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
First,
let
us
prove
that
ϕ
is
an
isomorphism
in
the
case
where
n
=

In
this
case,
we
shall
denote
by
Π2/1
(respectively,
M
)
the
kernel
of
the
natural
[outer]
surjection
Π2

induced
by
the
ﬁrst
projection

(respectively,
the

of

To
verify
that
ϕ
is
an
isomorphism,
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
M
=
{0}.
First,
let
us
observe
that
the
structure
of
J
may
be
described
explicitly
by
applying
the
well-known
structure
theory
of
surface
groups.
If
r
=
0,
then
[since
J
=
{0}]
it
follows
immediately
that
M
=
{0}.
Thus,
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
M
=
{0}
under
the
assumption
that
r
>

Suppose
that
M
=
{0}.
Then
since
J
∼

it
holds
that

is
a
free

of
rank

where
either
A
=

or
A
=

for

Thus,
we
obtain

the

is
exact
by
deﬁnition.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
it
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of

that
α
⊗

is
an

This
observation,
together
with
the
split

of

implies
that
the

Thus,
it

immediately
that

On

we
conclude
from
the
evident

of
[CbTpI],
Lemma

we

Thus,
since

we
conclude
that

a
contradiction.
This
completes
the
proof
that
ϕ
is
an
isomorphism
in
the
case
where
n
=
2.
Next,
we
consider
the
case
where
n
≥
3.
First,
we
make
the
following
observation,
which
follows
immediately
from
the
Zariski-Nagata
purity
theorem:
Ker(ϕ)
=
{0}
if
and
only
if,
for
every
pair
of
integers
(i,
j)
such
that
1
≤
i
<
j
≤
n,
the
image,
via
the
natural
surjection
Πn

Πab
n
,
of
the
inertia
subgroup
I[i,
j]
⊆
Πn
determined,
up
to
Πn
-conjugacy,
by
the
diagonal
divisor
Xn
corresponding
to
the
i-th
and
j-th
factors
is
trivial.
Denote
by
Π[i,
j]
the
kernel
of
the
natural
[outer]
surjection
Πn

Πn−2
determined
by
the
projection
fi,j
:
Xn
→
Xn−2
obtained
by
forgetting
the
factors
labeled
i,
j.
In
particular,
we
may
identify
Π[i,
j]
with
the
prol
fundamental
group
of
the
second
conﬁguration
space
Z2
of
a
hyperbolic
curve
Z
of
type
(g,
r
+
n
−
2)
over
k.
Here,
we
note
that,
relative
to
this
identiﬁcation,
we
may
identify
the
inertia
subgroup
of
Π[i,
j]
determined,
up
to
Πn
-conjugacy,
by
the
diagonal
divisor
of
Z
×k
Z
with
I[i,
j].
Thus,
by
applying
the
fact
that
ϕ
is
an
isomorphism
in
the
case
where
n
=
2,
together
with
the
above
observation,
we
conclude
that
the
image
of
I[i,
j]
⊆
Π[i,
j]
via
the
natural
surjection
Π[i,
j]

(Π[i,
j])ab
is
trivial,
hence
that
the
image
of
I[i,
j]
⊆
Πn
via
the
natural
surjection
Πn

Πab
n
is
trivial.
Therefore,
again
by
the
above
observation,
we
obtain
that
Ker(ϕ)
=
{0}.
This
completes
the
proof
that
ϕ
is
an
isomorphism
in
the
case
of
arbitrary
n.
The
ﬁnal
portion
of
assertion
(ii)
now
follows
formally
from
the
fact
that
ϕ
is
an
isomorphism,
together
with
the
well-known
structure
theory
of
surface
groups.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Assertion
(iii)
follows
from
assertions
(i),
(ii)
by
considering
ranks.
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iv).
Suppose
that
(g,
r)
=
(1,
1).
Then
since
rkZl
(Πab
1
)
=
2,
and,
moreover,
ϕ
is
an
isomorphism
[cf.
assertion
(iii)],
ab
it
follows
that
rkZl
(Πab
n
)
=
2n.
Conversely,
suppose
that
rkZl
(Πn
)
=
2n.
Then
since
ϕ
is
surjective,
it
follows
that
ab
rkZl
(Πab
1
×
·
·
·
×
Π1
)
≤
2n.
Thus,
since
rkZl
(Πab

)
≥
2,
we
have:
ab
rkZl
(Πab
1

·
·
·

=
2n,
rkZl
(Πab

=

In

that

in

an

hence
that

(respectively,
that

Proposition

(Properties
of

Let
n
≥

be
an
integer;
Σ
a

of
prime
numbers
which
is
either
of

or
equal
to
the

of

Then
the

hold:
(i)
Every
quasi-co-surface
subgroup
of
Πn
contains
a
co-surface
subgroup
of
Πn
.
(ii)
It
holds
that
(g,

{(0,

(1,

if
and
only
if
there
exists
a
quasico-surface
subgroup
of
Πn
.
(iii)
Suppose
that
(g,
r)
∈
/
{(0,

(1,

Then
a
subgroup
of
Πn
is
a
co-surface
subgroup
of
Πn
if
and
only
if
it
is
a
minimal
quasico-surface
subgroup
of
Πn
.
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
Let
H
be
a
quasi-co-surface
subgroup
of
Πn
;
def
φ
:
Πn

G
=
Πn
/H
the
natural
surjection.
Then
we
consider
the
following
claim:
Claim
2.3A:
Any
two
ﬁber
subgroups
J1
,
J2
⊆
Πn
of
length
one
[cf.
[MT],
Deﬁnition
2.3,
(iii)]
such
that
φ(J1
)
=
{1},
φ(J2
)
=
{1}
necessarily
coincide.
Indeed,
suppose
that
there
exist
two
distinct
ﬁber
subgroups
J1
,
J2
⊆
Πn
of
length
one
such
that
φ(J1
)
=
{1},
φ(J2
)
=
{1}.
Then
since
φ(J1
)
and
φ(J2
)
are
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated
closed
normal
subgroups
of
the
surface
group
G,
it
follows
from
[MT],
Theorem
1.5,
that
φ(J1
)
and
φ(J2
)
are
open
in
G.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
it
follows
immediately
from
[MT],
Proposition
2.4,
(v),
that
there
exists
a
closed
normal
subgroup
N
⊆
G
that
is
topologically
normally
generated
by
a
single
element
such
that
the
images
of
φ(J1
)
and
φ(J2
)
in
G/N
commute.
Thus,
we
conclude
that
G/N
has
an
abelian
open
subgroup,
hence
that
G
is
nearly
abelian
[cf.
[MT],
Deﬁnition
6.1].
On
the
other
hand,
since
G
is
a
surface
group,
it
follows
from
[MT],
Proposition
6.2,
that
G
is
a
free
pro-Σ
group
of
rank
two
—
in
contradiction
to
the
deﬁnition
of
a
quasi-co-surface
subgroup
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.1,
(iii)].
This
completes
the
proof
of
Claim
2.3A.
It
follows
formally
from
Claim
2.3A
that
there
exist
n
−
1
[distinct]
ﬁber
subgroups
of
Πn
of
length
one
whose
images
via
φ
are
trivial.
Thus,
the
closed
normal
subgroup
of
Πn
topologically
generated
by
these
n
−
1
ﬁber
subgroups
is
a
co-surface
subgroup
of
Πn
that
is
contained
in
H.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Next,
we
consider
the
following
claim:
24
YUICHIRO
HOSHI,
ARATA
MINAMIDE,
AND
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
Claim
2.3B:
Suppose
that
(g,
r)
∈
/
{(0,
3),
(1,
1)}.
Then
every
co-surface
subgroup
of
Πn
is
a
quasi-co-surface
subgroup
of
Πn
.
Claim
2.3B
follows
immediately
from
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved.
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
The
necessity
portion
of
assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
Claim
2.3B.
Thus,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
the
suﬃciency
portion
of
assertion
(ii).
Suppose
that
there
exists
a
quasi-co-surface
subgroup
H
of
Πn
.
Then
it
follows
from
assertion
(i)
that
there
exists
a
co-surface
subgroup
N
⊆
Πn
such
that
N
⊆
H.
Thus,
we
have
a
surjection
(Πn
/N
)ab

(Πn
/H)ab

Σ
-modules.
Since
rkΣ
(Πn
/H)ab
>
2,
we
thus
conclude
that
of
free
Z
Z
rkZΣ
(Πn
/N
)ab
>
2,
hence
that
(g,
r)
∈
/
{(0,
3),
(1,
1)}.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
suﬃciency
portion
of
assertion
(ii).
Finally,
we
consider
assertion
(iii).
Let
H
be
a
co-surface
subgroup
of
Πn
.
First,
we
observe
that
H
is
a
quasi-co-surface
subgroup
of
Πn
[cf.
Claim
2.3B].
Next,
let
us
verify
the
minimality
of
H.
Let
N
⊆
Πn
be
a
quasi-cosurface
subgroup
such
that
N
⊆
H.
Then
it
follows
from
assertion
(i)
that
there
exists
a
co-surface
subgroup
K
of
Πn
such
that
K
⊆
N
.
Since
both
K
and
H
are
co-surface
subgroups
of
Πn
,
we
conclude
that
K
=
H
[cf.
[MT],
Proposition
2.4,
(ii)],
hence
that
N
=
H.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
minimality
of
H.
Conversely,
let
H
be
a
minimal
quasi-co-surface
subgroup
of
Πn
.
Then,
by
assertion
(i),
there
exists
a
co-surface
subgroup
N
⊆
Πn
such
that
N
⊆
H.
Since
N
is
quasi-co-surface
subgroup
of
Πn
[cf.
Claim
2.3B],
we
conclude
from
the
minimality
of
H
that
N
=
H.
In
particular,
H
is
a
co-surface
subgroup
of
Πn
.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(iii).

Assertions
(i),
(ii),
(iii),
(v),
and
(vi)
follow
immediately
from
the
various
results
cited
in
the
statements
of
these
assertions,
together
with
the
various
deﬁnitions
involved.
Thus,
it
remains
to
verify
assertion
(iv).
First,
we
consider
the
reconstruction
of
generalized
ﬁber
subgroups
of
Πn
of
co-length
one.
It
follows
from
Remark
2.1.1;
[MT],
Theorem
1.5;
[MT],
Proposition
2.2,
(ii);
[MT],
Proposition
2.4,
(i),
that
every
generalized
ﬁber
subgroup
of
Πn
of
co-length
one
is
a
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated
closed
normal
subgroup
of
Πn
satisfying
conditions
(iv-a),
(iv-b).
Conversely,
let
H
be
a
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated
closed
normal
subgroup
of
Πn
satisfying
conditions
(iv-a),
(iv-b).
Then
it
follows
from
condition
(iv-b)
that
there
exists
a
generalized
projection
morphism
pX
:
Xn
→
X
such
that
the
image
of
H
via
the
composite
pΠ
pab
(l)
Πn

Π1
→
(Π1
)ab
⊗Zl
Ql
—
where
the
ﬁrst
arrow
is
the
natural
[outer]
surjection
induced
by
pX
;
the
second
arrow
is
the
natural
morphism
—
is
trivial.
Now
we
claim
that
pΠ
(H)
=
{1}.
Indeed,
suppose
that
pΠ
(H)
=
{1}.
Then
since
pΠ
(H)
is
a
28

ARATA

AND
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
nontrivial
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated
closed
normal
subgroup
of
Π1
,
it
follows
from
[MT],
Theorem
1.5,
that
pΠ
(H)
is
open
in
Π1
.
But
this
implies
that
pab
factors
through
the
ﬁnite
quotient
Π1

Π1
/pΠ
(H).
Thus,
we
conclude
that
Im(pab
)
is
ﬁnite
—
a
contradiction.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
claim.
In
light
of
the
claim,
it
holds
that
H
⊆
Ker(pΠ
).
Now
suppose
that
Ker(pΠ
)/H
=
{1}.
Then
since
Ker(pΠ
)/H
is
a
nontrivial
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated
closed
normal
subgroup
of
Πn
/H,
it
follows
from
condition
∼
(iv-a)
that
Πn
/Ker(pΠ
)
→
Π1
is
ﬁnite
—
a
contradiction.
Thus,
we
conclude
that
H
=
Ker(pΠ
),
hence
that
H
is
a
generalized
ﬁber
subgroup
of
Πn
of
co-length
one,
as
desired.
Thus,
to
complete
the
veriﬁcation
of
assertion
(iv),
it
remains
to
consider
the
reconstruction
of
the
set
T(g,r,n)
.
We
begin
by
recalling
the
explicit
constructions
in
the
case
where
•
(g,
r)

In

that

in

•
(g,

from
the

Proof
of
Theorem

that

—
each
subspace
W
∈
S(g,r,n)
maps
into
some
subspace
T
∈
T(g,r,n)
.
On
the
other
hand,
an
elementary
computation
of
the
dimensions
of
W
and
T
shows
that
this
implies
that
W
maps
isomorphically
onto
T
.
Moreover,
one
computes
immediately
that
S(g,r,n)
and
T(g,r,n)
are
of
the
same
cardinality.
We
thus
conclude
that
α(g,r,n)
in∼
duces
a
bijection
S(g,r,n)
→
T(g,r,n)
.
Thus,
to
complete

Claim
2.5A.
In
the
following,
we
write

for

First,
suppose
that
(g,

In
this

recall
that
we

Moreover,
the

on

is
described
explicitly
in
the
discussion
preceding
the
statement
of
[Nk],
Lemma
4.1.2
[cf.
also
[Nk],
Proof
of

It
follows
immediately
from
this
explicit
description
[cf.
also
the
above
discussion
of
α(g,r,n)

that

induces
a
permutation
of
the

Thus,
we
conclude
that
the

for

Next,
suppose
that

recall
that

equipped
with

[cf.

Moreover,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
explicit

In
the
following,
we
shall
use
ιn
to
regard
Sn∗
as
a
subgroup
of
Out(Πn
).
In
particular,
we
have
inclusions
Sn∗
⊆
ZOut(Πn
)
(OutgF
(Πn
))
⊆
Z
loc
(Out(Πn
)).
(ii)
Suppose
that
(g,
r)
∈
/
{(0,
4),
(1,
1),
(1,
2),
(2,
0)}.
Then
Sn∗
=
ZOut(Πn
)
(OutgF
(Πn
))
=
Z
loc
(Out(Πn
))
—
i.e.,
one
may
reconstruct
the
subgroup
Sn∗
⊆
Out(Πn
)
[cf.
(i)]
group-theoretically
from
Πn
as
the
local
center
Z
loc
(Out(Πn
))
of
Out(Πn
).
(iii)
If
n∗
≥
3,
then
we
have
an
equality
OutgF
(Πn
)
=
ZOut(Πn
)
(Sn∗
).
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
The
fact
that
ιn
determines
a
section
of
the
surjection
Out(Πn
)

Sn∗
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions.
Next,
let
us
recall
[cf.
[CbTpII],
Theorem
2.3,
(iv)]
that
[since
it
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
OutgF
(Πn
)
⊆
OutF
(Πn
)]
ιn
(Sn
)
⊆
ZOut(Πn
)
(OutF
(Πn
))
⊆
ZOut(Πn
)
(OutgF
(Πn
)).
Thus,
since
n
≥
2,
by
conjugating
the
composite
inclusion
of
the
preceding
display
by
arbitrary
elements
of
Sn∗
,
we
conclude
that
ιn
(Sn∗
)
⊆
ZOut(Πn
)
(OutgF
(Πn
)).
∼
Now
the
fact
that
ιn
determines
a
natural
isomorphism
OutgF
(Πn
)
×
Sn∗
→
Out(Πn
)
follows
formally.
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
In
light
of
the
inclusions
of
the
ﬁnal
display
of
the
statement
of
assertion
(i),
to
verify
assertion
(ii),
it
suﬃces
to
verify
the
following
claim:
Claim
2.6A:
Suppose
that
(g,
r)
∈
/
{(0,
4),
(1,
1),
(1,
2),
(2,
0)}.
Then
we
have
Z
loc
(Out(Πn
))
⊆
Sn∗
.
First,
we
assume
that
(g,
r)
=
(0,
3).
Let
L
be
a
number
ﬁeld;
ρtpd
L
:
GL
→
Out(Πn
)
the
natural
pro-Σ
outer
Galois
representation
associated
to
the
n-th
conﬁgdef
uration
space
Tn
of
T
=
P1L
\
{0,
1,
∞};
σ
∈
Z
loc
(Out(Πn
)).
Thus,
there
exists
an
open
subgroup
H
of
Out(Πn
)
such
that
σ
∈
ZOut(Πn
)
(H).
In
particular,
by
replacing
L
by
a
suitable
ﬁnite
ﬁeld
extension
of
L,
we
may
assume
that
Im(ρtpd
L
)
⊆
H.
Then
it
follows
from
[Nk],
Theorem
A;
[IN],
Theorem
C
[or,
alternatively,
from
assertion
(i);
[CbTpII],
Theorem
A,
(i);
[LocAn],
Theorem
A],
that
tpd
∗
∗
σ
∈
ZOut(Πn
)
(Im(ρtpd
L
))
=
Sn
×
ZOutgF
(Πn
)
(Im(ρL
))
=
Sn
.
This
completes
the
proof
of
Claim
2.6A
in
the
case
where
(g,
r)
=
(0,
3).
NUMERICAL
INVARIANTS
AND

Thus,
in
the
remainder
of
the
proof
of
Claim
2.6A,
we
may
assume
that
(g,
r)
∈
/
{(0,
3),
(0,
4),
(1,
1),
(1,
2),
(2,
0)}.
Thus,
n
=
n∗
,
OutgF
(Πn
)
=
OutF
(Πn
).
Let
σ
∈
Z
loc
(Out(Πn
)).
Thus,
there
exists
an
open
subgroup
H
of
OutF
(Πn
)
such
that
σ
∈
ZOut(Πn
)
(H).
Moreover,
by
assertion
(i),
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
σ
∈
OutF
(Πn
).
Now
we
claim
that
Claim
2.6B:
It
holds
that
σ
∈
OutFC
(Πn
)
—
where
we
write
OutFC
(Πn
)
for
the
group
of
FC-admissible
outer
automorphisms
of
Πn
[cf.
[CmbCusp],
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(ii)].
Indeed,
since,
by
assertion
(i),
H
is
open
in
Out(Πn
),
our
assumption
that
σ
∈
ZOut(Πn
)
(H)
implies
that
Claim
2.6B
follows
from
[CmbGC],
Proposition
2.4,
(v);
[CmbGC],
Corollary
2.7,
(i).
Next,
let
us
write
ρg,r,n
:
Π(Mg,r
)k
→
OutFC
(Πn
)
for
the
outer
representation
induced
by
the
[1-]morphism
(Mg,r+n
)k
→
(Mg,r
)k
obtained
by
forgetting
the
last
n
marked
points.
Then
since,
by
assertion
(i),
H
is
open
in
Out(Πn
),
there
exists
an
open
subgroup
N
of
Π(Mg,r
)k
such
that
σ
∈
ZOutFC
(Πn
)
(ρg,r,n
(N
)).
Write
φn
:
OutFC
(Πn
)
→
OutFC
(Π1
)
for
the
homomorphism
induced
by
the
ﬁrst
projection
Xn
→
X.
Then
it
follows
from
[CbTpI],
Theorem
D,
(i),
together
with
our
assumption
on
(g,
r),
that
φn
(σ)
∈
ZOutFC
(Π1
)
(φn
(ρg,r,n
(N
)))
=
{1}.
Thus,
since
φn
is
injective
[cf.
[NodNon],
Theorem
B],
we
conclude
that
σ
=
1.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Assertion
(iii)
follows
immediately
from
assertion
(i)
and
the
well-known
fact
that,
since
n∗
≥
3,
Sn∗
is
center-free.

Deﬁnition
2.7.
In
the
notation
of
Corollary
2.6,
suppose
that
(g,
r)
=
(0,

Write
OutFCS
(Πn

⊆
Out(Πn

for

the

of
ιn
:

[cf.
[CmbCusp],

Then
[by
a

abuse
of
the
notational
conventions
established
in
the
discussion
entitled

In

we

First,

Let

observe
that
we

—
where
we

for

[cf.

the
second
equality
follows
by
applying
Corollary
2.6,
(iii),
and
[CbTpII],
Theorem
A,
(ii).
Thus,
assertion
(i)
follows
immediately
from
[CmbCusp],
Corollary

Assertion

follows
from

and

The

to

We

α

We

that,
if
we
write
Kprm

the

then
Kprm
is
a

Remark
3.1.1.
Observe
that
it
follows
formally
from

(iii),
that
any

itself

Remark
3.1.2.
In

of

(iii),
let
K

be
a

Then
since
Kprm
⊆
K
is
a
regular

[cf.
[Bbk],
Chapter

we
conclude
that

surjective,

that
Kprm

Proposition
3.3.
(Basic
properties
of
[strongly]
l-cyclotomically
full
ﬁelds).
Let
K
be
a
ﬁeld,
K

a
ﬁnitely
generated
ﬁeld
extension
of
K.
Then
the
following
hold:
(i)
If
K
is
l-cyclotomically
full,
then
ch(K)
=
l.
(ii)
If
K
is
strongly
l-cyclotomically
full,
then
K
is
l-cyclotomically
full.
(iii)
Suppose
that
ch(K)
>
0.
Then
K
is
l-cyclotomically
full
if
and
only
if
K
is
strongly
l-cyclotomically
full.
(iv)
K
is
l-cyclotomically
full
if
and
only
if
K

is.
(v)
K
is
strongly
l-cyclotomically

if
and
only
if
K

is.
def
(vi)
Suppose
that
K
is
strongly
l-cyclotomically
full.
Write
T
=
P1K
\
{0,
1,
∞}.
Let
Y
be
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
K
that
admits
a
ﬁnite
étale
Galois
covering
Y
→
T
of
degree
d,
where
d
is
invertible
in
K.
Write
Z
for
the
[K-]smooth
compactiﬁcation
of
Y
,
1
ρ
:
GK
→
AutQl
(Hét
(Z
×K
K,
Ql
))
for
the
Galois
representation
on
the
ﬁrst
l-adic
étale
cohomology
module
of
Z.
Then
there
exists
an
element
g
∈
GK
such
that
ρ(g)
is
χK
(g)-transverse.
(vii)
Suppose
that
K
is
a
mixed
characteristic,
nonarchimedean
local
ﬁeld,
i.e.,
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
the
ﬁeld
Qp
of
p-adic
numbers.
Then
K
is
l-cyclotomically
full,
but
not
strongly
l-cyclotomically
full.
(viii)
Suppose
that
K
is
either
the
ﬁeld
Q
of
rational
numbers
or
a
ﬁnite
ﬁeld
of
characteristic
=
l.
Then
every
ﬁnitely
generated
ﬁeld
extension
of
K
is
strongly
l-cyclotomically
full.
Proof.
Assertion
(i)
follows
immediately
from
the
well-known
fact
that
if
ch(K)
=
l,
then
the
cyclotomic
character
χK
:
GK
→
Z×
l
is
trivial.
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(ii).
Suppose
that
K
is
strongly
l-cyclotomically
full.
We
apply
the
notation
of
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(iii).
Then
let
us
observe
that
to
verify
that
K
is
l-cyclotomically
full,
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
L
is
l-cyclotomically
full
[cf.
Remark
3.1.2].
Also,
we
observe
that
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
[cf.
assertion
(i)]
that
l
is
invertible
in
A.
Since
A
is
normal,
this
assumption
implies
that
the
l-adic
cyclotomic
character
χL
:
GL
→
Z×
l
NUMERICAL
INVARIANTS
AND
DISTINGUISHED
SUBGROUPS
41
associated
to
L
may
be
thought
of
as
the
restriction
via
the
natural
[outer]
surjection
GL

π1
(Spec(A))
induced
by
the
injection
A
→
L
of
the
l-adic
cyclotomic
character
χA
:
π1
(Spec(A))
→
Z×
l
associated
to
A.
On
the
other
hand,
since
[cf.
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(iii)]
there
exists
a
prime
ideal
p
∈
Spec(A)
such
that
k(p)
is
l-cyclotomically
full,
we
thus
conclude
that
the
image
of
χA
,
hence
also
of
χL
,
is
inﬁnite.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(ii).
Assertion
(iii)
follows
immediately
from
assertion
(ii)
and
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(iii).
Since
the
natural
outer
homomorphism
GK

→
GK
is
[well-known
to
be]
open,
assertion
(iv)
follows
immediately
from
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(iii).
Assertion
(v)
in
the
case
where
ch(K)
>
0
follows
immediately
from
assertions
(iii)
and
(iv).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(v)
in
the
case
where
ch(K)
=
0,
and
K
is
strongly
l-cyclotomically
full
[cf.
Remark
3.1.1].
We
apply
the
notation
of
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(iii).
Let
L
be
one
of
the
residue
ﬁelds

of
the
artinian
ring
L
⊗Kprm
Kprm
[cf.
Remark
3.1.2].
Then
observe
that

since
ch(K)
=
ch(L)
=
0,
L
is
a
ﬁnite
separable
ﬁeld
extension
of
L.
But,
since
A
is
noetherian,
this
implies
that
the
normalization
A
of
A
in
L
is
a
ﬁnite
A-module.
Thus,
assertion
(v)
in
the
case
where
ch(K)
=
0
follows
immediately
from
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(iii),
together
with
assertion
(iv).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(v).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(vi).
We
apply
the
notation
of
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(iii).
Then,
since
d
is
invertible
in
K,
it
follows
from
well-known
elementary
arguments
in
algebraic
geometry
[cf.,
e.g.,
the
proof
of
[CanLift],
Proposition
2.3,
(ii)]
that,
after
possibly
replacing
K
by
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
K
[cf.
assertion
(v)],
one
may
descend
the
diagram
Z
⊇
Y
→
T
of
smooth
curves
over
K
to
a
diagram
Zprm
⊇
Yprm
→
Tprm
of
smooth
curves
over
Kprm
.
In
particular,
by
Remark
3.1.2,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
K
=
Kprm
.
Moreover,
one
may
base-change
the
diagram
Z
⊇
Y
→
T
of
smooth
curves
over
K
=
Kprm
to
a
diagram
ZL
⊇
YL
→
TL
of
smooth
curves
over
L.
Next,
we
observe
that,
by
possibly
replacing
A
by
A[
f1
]
for
a
suitable
nonzero
f
∈
A,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
this
diagram
ZL
⊇
YL
→
TL
of
smooth
curves
over
L
arises
from
a
diagram
ZA
⊇
YA
→
TA
of
smooth
curves
over
A,
and
that
d
is
invertible
in
A.
Thus,
by
restricting
to
a
point
p
∈
Spec(A)
as
in
the
display
of
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(iii),
we
obtain
a
diagram
Zp
⊇
Yp
→
Tp
of
smooth
curves
over
k(p).
In
particular,
by
replacing
K
by
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
k(p)prm
,
we
conclude
that
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
[cf.
[SGA1],
EXPOSÉ
X,
Corollaire
3.9]
that
K
is
an
l-cyclotomically
full
algebraic
extension
of
a
ﬁnite
ﬁeld
K0
.
Moreover,
it
follows
immediately
from
well-known
properties
of
absolute
Galois
groups
of
ﬁnite
ﬁelds
that
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality,
after
possibly
replacing
K
and
K0
by
ﬁnite
extensions
[cf.
assertion
(iv)]
of
K
and
K0
,
respectively,
that
the
natural
[outer]
injection
GK
→
GK0
induces
an
isomorphism
on
maximal
pro-l
quotients,
and
that
ρ
factors
through
the
maximal
pro-l
quotient
of
GK
.
But
then
assertion
(vi)
follows
immediately
from
the
“Riemann
hypothesis”
for
abelian
varieties
over
ﬁnite
ﬁelds
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Mumf],
p.
206].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(vi).
Next,
we
consider
assertion
(vii).
When
l
=
p,
the
fact
that
K
is
lcyclotomically
full
follows
immediately
from
the
fact
that
the
residue
ﬁeld
42
YUICHIRO
HOSHI,
ARATA
MINAMIDE,
AND
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
of
K
is
ﬁnite
[together
with
well-known
facts
concerning
the
structure
of
ﬁnite
ﬁelds].
When
l
=
p,
the
fact
that
K
is
l-cyclotomically
full
follows
immediately
from
well-known
facts
concerning
ramiﬁcation
in
cyclotomic
extensions
of
Qp
[cf.
also
assertion
(iv)].
Next,
assume
that
K
is
strongly
l-cyclotomically
full.
Observe
that,
by
assertion
(v),
from
the
point
of
view
of
deriving
a
contradiction
to
this
assumption,
we
may
always
replace
K
by
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
K.
Let
E
be
a
Tate
curve
over
K
[i.e.,
a
smooth,
proper
curve
of
genus
1
over
K
that
has
stable,
multiplicative
reduction
over
the
ring
of
integers
of
K]
that
is
deﬁned
over
a
number
ﬁeld.
Thus,
by
applying
the
theory
of
Belyi
maps
[cf.
[Belyi]],
we
conclude
that
there
exists
a
dense
open
subscheme
U
⊆
E
that
admits
a
ﬁnite
étale
morphism
U
→
T
,
where
T
is
as
in
assertion
(vi).
Note,
moreover,
that,
by
possibly
replacing
K
by
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
K,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
there
exists
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
Y
→
U
of
hyperbolic
curves
over
K
such
that
the
composite
ﬁnite
étale
morphism
Y
→
U
→
T
is
Galois.
On
the
other
hand,
the
well-known
appearance
of
the
cyclotomic
character
in
the
Galois
action
on
the
Tate
module
of
a
Tate
curve
[cf.
[Serre],
IV,
§A.1.2]
implies
that
this
ﬁnite
étale
Galois
covering
Y
→
T
yields
a
contradiction
to
the
conclusion
of
assertion
(vi).
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(vii).
Finally,
since
ﬁnite
ﬁelds
of
characteristic
=
l
are
clearly
l-cyclotomically
full,
assertion
(viii)
follows
immediately
from
assertions
(iii),
(v)
[cf.

Deﬁnition
3.1,
(iii);

A
a

Proposition

follows
immediately
from

(ii)
[cf.
also
the
commutative

in
the

of


Remark
3.5.1.
Observe
that,
in
Proposition
3.5,
the
natural
[outer]
surjection
p
:
Δn

Δn
may
in
fact
be
taken
to
be
the
natural
[outer]
surjection
induced
by
a
“generalized

morphism”.
That
is
to
say,
although
the
notion
of
a
“generalized
projection
morphism”
is
only
deﬁned
in
Deﬁnition
2.1,
(i),
in
the
case
where
X
log
is
smooth,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
a
similar
deﬁnition
may
be
made
in
the
case
of
arbitrary
X
log
[i.e.,
as
in
the
present
§3].
Alternatively,
in
the
notation
of
Remark
2.1.1,
one
may
observe
NUMERICAL
INVARIANTS

43
that,
by
a
similar

to
the
argument
applied
in
Remark
2.1.1,
the
symmetric
group
on
n∗
letters
Sn∗
acts
naturally
on
Xnlog
,
hence
induces
a
natural
outer
action
of
Sn∗
on
Δn
;
thus,
in
Proposition
3.5,
one
may
take
the
natural
[outer]
surjection
p

to
be
the

Lemma
3.6.
(Commensurable
terminality).
Every
log-full
subgroup
of
Δn
is
commensurably
terminal
in
Δn
.
Proof.
Let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that,
to
verify
Lemma
3.6,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
k
is
algebraically
closed.
Let
A
be
a
log-full
subgroup
of
Δn
.
Note
that
the
inclusion
A
⊆
CΔn
(A)
is
clear.
We
prove
the
inclusion
CΔn
(A)
⊆
A
by
induction
on
n.
The
case
where
n
=
1
follows
from
[CmbGC],
Proposition
1.2,
(ii).
Next,
suppose
that
n
>
1,
and
that
the
induction
hypothesis
is
in
force.
Write
p
:
Δn

Δn−1
for
the
natural
[outer]
log
obtained
by
surjection
induced
by
the
projection
morphism
Xnlog
→
Xn−1
forgetting
the
last
factor.
Then
since
p(A)
is
a
log-full
subgroup
of
Δn−1
[cf.
Proposition
3.5],
by
applying
the
induction
hypothesis,
we
conclude
that
CΔn−1
(p(A))
⊆
p(A).
Thus,
we
obtain
that
p(A)
⊆
p(CΔn
(A))
⊆
CΔn−1
(p(A))
⊆
p(A),
hence
that
p(A)
=
p(CΔn
(A)).
Therefore,
to
verify
the
inclusion
CΔn
(A)
⊆
A,
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
Δn/n−1
∩
A
=
Δn/n−1
∩
CΔn
(A)
def
—
where
we
write
Δn/n−1
=
Ker(p).
Let
xn
∈
Xn
be
a
log-full
point
of
Xn
such
that
A
=
Δxn
[cf.
Deﬁnition
3.4].
Write
xn−1
∈
Xn−1
for
the
image
log
,
xlog
of
xn
via
Xnlog
→
Xn−1
n−1
for
the
log
scheme
obtained
by
restricting
the
log
log
structure
of
Xn−1
to
the
[reduced,
artinian]
closed
subscheme
of
Xn−1
def
determined
by
xn−1
,
and
(Xnlog
)xn−1
=
Xnlog
×X
log
xlog
n−1
.
Then
we
observe
n−1
that
—
by
applying
[Hsh],
Theorem
2,
to
the
completion
of
the
natural
log
along
the
natural
projection
morphism
projection
morphism
Xnlog
→
Xn−1
log
log
(Xn
)xn−1
→
xn−1
—
we
may
identify
Δn/n−1
with
the
maximal
pro-Σ
quotient
of
the
kernel
of
the
[outer]
surjection
π1
((Xnlog
)xn−1
)

π1
(xlog
n−1
).
Next,
let
us
observe
that
Δn/n−1
∩
A
is
a
log-full
subgroup
of
Δn/n−1
that
arises
from
the
log-full
point
of
the
underlying
scheme
of
(Xnlog
)xn−1
determined
by
xn
[cf.
the
commutative
diagram
in
the
proof
of
Proposition
1.2].
Thus,
it
follows
from
the
case
where
n
=
1
that
CΔn/n−1
(Δn/n−1
∩
A)
⊆
Δn/n−1
∩
A,
hence
that
Δn/n−1
∩
A
⊆
Δn/n−1
∩
CΔn
(A)
⊆
CΔn/n−1
(Δn/n−1
∩
A)
⊆
Δn/n−1
∩
A.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
equality
Δn/n−1
∩
A
=
Δn/n−1
∩
CΔn
(A)
and
hence
of

Here,
we
note
that,
in
the
situation
of
(ii-3),
the
deﬁnition
of
δn
|H
is
manifestly
group-theoretic,
and
that
a
group-theoretic
characterization
of
the
integer
m
may
be
obtained
by
applying
Theorem
2.5,
(i),
(vi),
together
with
[when
n
=
1]
assumption
(a);
Proposition
3.3,
(ii);
[CmbGC],
Corollary
2.7,
(i).
Proof.
First,
we
note
that
it
follows
from
Lemma
3.6
that
the
equivalence
A
is
log-full
⇔
A
satisﬁes
the
resp’d
portion
of
conditions
(i)
and
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
the
equivalence
A
is
quasi-log-full
⇔
A
satisﬁes
the
non-resp’d
portion
of
conditions
(i)
and
(ii).
Thus,
in
the
remainder
of
the
proof
of
Theorem
3.8,
we
prove
the
nonresp’d
equivalence.
Suppose
that
A
satisﬁes
conditions
(i),
(ii).
Then
we
prove
that
A
is
quasi-log-full
by
induction
on
n.
First,
we
consider
the
case
where
n
=
1.
In
this
case,
since
A
is
nontrivial
procyclic
[cf.
condition
(i)],
it
follows
from
assumption
(b);
condition
(ii);
Proposition
3.2;
[NodNon],
Lemma
1.6,
that
A
is
contained
in
a
log-full
subgroup
⊆
Δ1
,
hence
that
A
is
quasi-log-full.
Next,
we
suppose
that
n
≥
2,
and
that
the
induction
hypothesis
is
in
force.
def
Let
k
be
an
algebraic
closure
of
k,
S
=
Spec(k).
In
this
case,
we
observe
that
we
have
an
exact
sequence
of
proﬁnite
groups
1
/
Δn/1
/
Δn
p
/
Δ1
/1
—
where
we
write
p
for
the
[outer]
surjection
induced
by
the
ﬁrst
projection
def
Xnlog
→
X
log
and
Δn/1
=
Ker(p).
In
particular,
it
follows
from
Lemma
1.5
and
condition
(i)
[cf.
also
Proposition
1.4;
[MT],
Proposition
2.4,
(i)]
that
p(A)
is
a
free,
abelian
closed
subgroup
of
Δ1
of
rank
1.
Moreover,
since
Z×
l
admits
a
torsion-free
open
subgroup,
one
veriﬁes
immediately,
by
applying
Proposition
3.2,
that,
after
possibly
replacing
H
[cf.
condition
(ii)]
by
a
suitable
open
subgroup
of
H,
it
holds
that
the
image
of
H
via
the
natural
surjection
Πn

Π1
induced
by
the
ﬁrst
projection
Xnlog
→
X
log
satisﬁes
“condition
(ii)
for
the
closed
subgroup
p(A)
⊆
Δ1
”.
In
particular,
it
follows
from
the
case
where
n
=
1
[which
has
already
been
veriﬁed]
that
p(A)
is
quasi-log-full,
hence,
that
there
exists
a
log-full
point
x
∈
X
×S
S
such
that
p(A)
is
an
open
subgroup
of
a
log-full
subgroup
Δx
⊆
Δ1
associated
to
x.
Write
x
∈
X
for
the
image
of
x
via
the
natural
morphism
X
×S
S
→
X,
Sxlog
for
the
log
scheme
obtained
by
restricting
the
log
structure
of
X
log
to
the
closed
subscheme
of
X
determined
by
x.
Then,
by
considering
the
base-change
of
the
ﬁrst
projection
X2log
→
X
log
via
the
natural
inclusion
Sxlog
→
X
log
,
we
obtain
a
stable
log
curve
def
Xxlog
=
X2log
×X
log
Sxlog
→
Sxlog
.
Next,
observe
that
the
stable
log
curve
Xxlog
may
be
obtained
by
“attaching”
the
tripod
“P1Sx
\
{0,
1,
∞}”,
in
a
suitable
fashion,
to
the
stable
log
curve
X
log
×S
log
Sxlog
.
Thus,
by
applying
Proposition
3.3,
(ii),
(v),
(vi),
to
NUMERICAL
INVARIANTS
AND
DISTINGUISHED

47
suitable

of
the

we
conclude
from
assumptions
(a),
(b)
[cf.

[NodNon],

[CmbGC],

1.1.3]
that
“assumptions

hold.

let

that

Thus,
A
∩
Δn/1
is
a
free
abelian
closed
subgroup
of
Δn/1
of
rank
n
−
1;
moreover,
one
veriﬁes
immediately,
by
applying
Proposition
3.2,
that
[since
Z×

admits
a
torsion-free
open
subgroup]
there
exists
an
open

of
the

of

by
pulling

the

respect
to
which
“condition
(ii)
for
the
closed

is
satisﬁed.
In
particular,
we
conclude
from
the

hypothesis
that

is

hence
that
there
exists
a
log-full

y

such
that
A

Δn/1
is
an
open

of
a

Δy
⊆

associated
to
y.
Next,
let
us
write
z

for
the
image
of

Here,
note
that
since
x

are

it
follows
from

Moreover,

veriﬁes

that

the

Therefore,
since
p(A)
(respectively,
A∩Δn/1

is
an
open
subgroup
of

it
follows
from

that

Conversely,
suppose

that

of
a
log-full

Δz

Then
since

we
conclude
that

Let

(Alternative
characterization
of

Fix
a
clean
chart
P
→
k
of
S
log
[cf.,
e.g.,
[Hsh],
Deﬁnition
B.1,
(ii)].
Write
T
log
for
the
log
scheme
whose
underlying
scheme
is
Spec(k[[P
]]),
and
whose
log
structure
is
deﬁned
by
the
natural
inclusion
P
→
k[[P
]];
S
log
→
T
log
for
the
[strict]
closed
immersion
determined
by
the
maximal
ideal
of
k[[P
]].
Let
Y
log
→
T
log
be
a
generically
smooth
stable
log
curve
whose
base-change
via
S
log
→
T
log
is
isomorphic
to
[hence
may
be
identiﬁed
with]
X
log
→
S
log
;
η
a
geometric
generic
point
of
T
;
A
a
log-full
subgroup
of
Δn
.
Write
Z
for
the
hyperbolic
curve
over
η
determined
by
the
interior
of
Y
log
×T
log
η;
Zn
for
the
n-th
conﬁguration
space
of
Z.
Here,
recall
that
we
have
a
natural
specialization
isomorphism
∼
π1
(Zn
)(l)
−→
Δ(l)
n
[cf.
the
discussion
preceding
[CmbCusp],
Deﬁnition

as
well
as
[CbTpI],

Then
the
following
conditions
are
equivalent:
(i)
A
is
of
quasi-smooth
type.
(ii)
A
is
of
smooth
type.
(l)
(iii)
For
each
l
∈
Σ,
the
image
of
A
in
Δn
coincides
with
the
image,
via
the

of
some

of

(Zn
)(l)
.

Proof.
First,
we
observe
that
the
geometric
generic
ﬁber
over
η
of
the
n-th
log
conﬁguration
space
Ynlog
→
T
log
associated
to
Y
log
→
T
log
satisﬁes
the
various
assumptions
imposed
on
“Xnlog
”
at
the
beginning
of
the
present
§3.
In
particular,
it
makes
sense
to
speak
of
log-full
subgroups
of
π1
(Zn
)
[which
may
be
naturally
identiﬁed
with
π1
(Ynlog
×T
log
η)].
Next,
we
observe
that
since
the
specialization
isomorphism
in
the
statement
of
Proposition
3.11
is
manifestly
compatible
with
the
various
generalized
projection
morphisms
of
co-length
1
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2.1,
(i);
Remark
3.5.1]
and
cuspidal
inertia
subgroups
in
the
images
of
such
generalized
projection
morphisms,
the
implication
(iii)
=⇒
(ii)
follows
immediately
by
applying
Proposition
3.5
[in
the
case
where
we
take
“Δn
”
to
be
π1
(Zn
)
and
“n
”
to
be
1],
together
with
Remark
3.5.1.
Moreover,
the
implication
(ii)
=⇒
(i)
is
a
formal
consequence
of
Deﬁnition
3.10.
Finally,
we
consider
the
implication
(i)
=⇒
(iii).
Suppose
that
condition
(i)
holds.
Then
it
follows
immediately
from
Deﬁnition
3.10
[cf.
also
[CmbGC],
Proposition
1.2,
(i)]
that
the
point
“xn
”
in
Deﬁnition
3.4
that
gives
rise
to
A
maps,
via
the
various
projection
morphisms
Xnlog
→
X
log
[of
which
there
are
precisely
n
—
cf.
Deﬁnition
2.1,
(i)],
to
a
cusp
of
X
log
.
Thus,
the
validity
of
condition
(iii)
follows
immediately
from
the
easily
veriﬁed
fact
that
the
deformation
Ynlog
→
T
log
becomes
trivial
when
restricted
to
the
intersection
[i.e.,
ﬁber
product]
of
the
inverse
images,
via
the
projection
morphisms
Ynlog
→
Y
log
,
of
the
reduced
closed
subscheme
of
Y
[i.e.,
the
underlying
scheme
of
Y
log
]
deﬁned
by
a
cusp
of
Y
log
[cf.
also
the
deﬁnition
of
the
specialization
isomorphism
in
the
statement
of
Proposition
3.11].

Corollary
3.12.
(Preservation
of
log-full
subgroups
of
smooth
type
by
FC-admissible
outer
automorphisms).
Let
A
⊆
Δn
be
a
logfull
subgroup
of
smooth
type,
σ
an
automorphism
of
Δn
.
Set
nmin
=
3
if
(g,
r)
=
(0,
3);
nmin
=
2
if
(g,
r)
=
(0,
3).
Then:
(i)
If
σ
is
FC-admissible
[cf.
[CmbCusp],
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(ii)],
then
σ(A)
⊆
Δn
is
a
log-full
subgroup
of
smooth
type.
(ii)
If
n
≥
nmin
,
then
σ(A)
⊆
Δn
is
a
log-full
subgroup
of
smooth
type
[i.e.,
even
if
σ
is
not
assumed
to
be
FC-admissible!].
Proof.
We
begin
by
observing
that,
by
applying
the
alternative
characterization
(ii)
⇐⇒
(iii)
of
Proposition
3.11,
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
X
log
is
a
smooth
log
curve.
Then
assertion
(i)
follows
immelog
over
log-full
diately
from
the
well-known
structure
of
ﬁbers
of
Xnlog
→
Xn−1
points
[cf.
[CbTpI],
Lemma
5.4,
(i),
(ii)]
—
which
allows
one
to
interpret
logfull
subgroups
of
Δn−1
as
groups
“Dehn(−)”
of
proﬁnite
Dehn-multi-twists
[cf.
[CbTpI],
Proposition
5.6,
(ii)]
—
by
applying
induction
on
n,
together
with
[CbTpI],
Theorem
5.14,
(iii)
[concerning
the
normalizer
of
“Dehn(−)”];

of

[CmbGC],
Corollary


Remark
3.12.1.
At
ﬁrst
glance,
it
may
appear
to
be
unclear
whether
or
not
Corollary
3.12,
(ii),
is
applicable
to
situations
such
as
the
situation
in
the
statement
of
Theorem
D
of
the
Introduction,
i.e.,
situations
involving
two
distinct
collections
of
data,
labeled
by
◦
and
•.
In
fact,
however,
Corollary
3.12,
(ii),
may
be
applied
to
such
situations,
by
considering
the
following
argument:
The
existence
of
the
isomorphism
α
of
Theorem
D
implies
[cf.
Theorem
2.5,
(vi)]
that
the
type
“(g,
r)”
associated
to
the
data
labeled
by

∈
{◦,
•}
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
.
In
particular,
it
follows
from
the
[well-known!]
connectedness
of
the
moduli
stack
of
hyperbolic
curves
of
type
(g,
r)
that
there
exists
at
least
one
isomorphism
of
proﬁnite
groups
∼
αmod
:
Δ◦n
→
Δ•n
[i.e.,
arising
from
the
classical
theory
of
the
étale
fundamental
group!]
that
maps
log-full
subgroups
to
log-full
subgroups.
On
the
other
hand,
the
given
isomorphism
α
diﬀers
from
αmod
by
composition
with
an
automorphism
α◦
of
Δ◦n
.
Thus,
the
fact
that
α◦
,
hence
also
α,
maps
log-full
subgroups
to
log-full
subgroups
follows
from
a
direct
application
of
Corollary
3.12,
(ii).
Remark
3.12.2.
In
some
sense,
a
more
“conceptually
satisfying”
approach
[i.e.,
by
comparison
to
the
approach
discussed
in
Remark
3.12.1]
to
seeing
that
Corollary
3.12,
(ii),
is
applicable
to
situations
such
as
the
situation
in
the
statement
of
Theorem
D
of
the
Introduction
may
be
obtained
simply
by
observing
that
the
various
reconstruction
algorithms
of
[CbTpI],
[CbTpII],
and
[CmbGC]
that
are
applied
in
the
proof
of
Corollary
3.12,
(ii),
to
show
the
preservation
of
log-full
subgroups
by
automorphisms
are,
in
fact,
entirely
functorial
and
group-theoretic
in
nature
[i.e.,
require
as
input
data
only
the
abstract
proﬁnite
group
Δn
].
We
leave
the
routine
details
to
the
interested
reader.
Lemma
3.13.
(Group-theoretic
characterization

for

Suppose
that
(g,

and
that
X
is
singular.
Let
A
be
an
edge-like
subgroup
[cf.

Deﬁnition

—
i.e.,
a
∼

—
of

.
Then
the
following
conditions
are
equivalent:
(i)
A
is
a
cuspidal
edge-like
subgroup
[cf.
Deﬁnition
3.1,
(i);
[CmbGC],

of

.
(ii)
The
image
of
A

surjection


Πab

is
trivial.
Proof.
Lemma
3.13
follows
immediately
from
the
following
well-known
fact:
If
A
is
a
cuspidal
(respectively,
nodal)
edge-like
subgroup
of
ΠG
,
then
the
natural
surjection
ΠG

Πab
G
maps
A
to
{0}
(respectively,
A
isomorphically
onto
its
[nonzero]
image).

YUICHIRO
HOSHI,
ARATA
MINAMIDE,
AND
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
In
the
following,
we
give
a
brief
sketch
of
a
proof
of
this
well-known
fact,
for
the
convenience
of
the
reader.
First,
observe
that
we
may
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
Σ
=
{l}.
Write
pG
:
ΠG

Πab
G
for
the
natural
surjection.
One
veriﬁes
easily
that
pG
maps
cuspidal
edge-like
subgroups
of
ΠG
to
{0}
[cf.
the
specialization
isomorphism
reviewed
in
the
statement
of
Proposition
3.11;
the
well-known
structure
theory
of
surface
groups].
Thus,
to
complete
the
veriﬁcation
of
the
fact
of
the
above
display,
it
remains
to
∼
consider
the
case
where
A
is
nodal.
In
this
case,
let
us
verify
that
A
→
pG
(A).
Suppose
that
pG
(A)
is
ﬁnite,
hence
trivial
[cf.
the
specialization
isomorphism
reviewed
in
the
statement
of
Proposition
3.11;
Proposition
2.2,
(ii)].
Write
G
for
the
underlying
semi-graph
of
G.
Let
Πv
⊆
ΠG
be
a
verticial
subgroup
[cf.
[CmbGC],
Deﬁnition
1.1,
(ii)]
associated
to
the
unique
vertex
of
G.
Then
it
follows
immediately
from
the
well-known
structure
theory
of
surface
groups
[i.e.,
in
this
case,
the
maximal
pro-l
quotient
of
the
étale
fundamental
group
of
the
aﬃne
line!]
that
pG
(Πv
)
=
{0}.
Thus,
we
conclude
that
the
rank
two
free
Zl
-module
Πab
G
[cf.
the
specialization
isomorphism
reviewed
in
the
statement
of
Proposition
3.11;
Proposition
2.2,

is
isomorphic
to
the
abelianization
of
the
pro-l
completion
of
the
topological
fundamental
group
of
G,
i.e.,
