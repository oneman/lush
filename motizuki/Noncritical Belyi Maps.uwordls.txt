In
the
present
paper,
we
present
a
slightly
strengthened
version
of
a
well-known
theorem
of
Belyi
on
the
existence
of
“Belyi
maps”.
Roughly
speaking,
this
strengthened
version
asserts
that
there
exist
Belyi
maps
which
are
unramiﬁed
at
[cf.
Theorem
2.5]
—
or
even
near
[cf.
Corollary
3.2]
—
a
prescribed
ﬁnite
set
of
points.

Introduction
Write
C
for
the
complex
number
ﬁeld;
Q
⊆
C
for
the
subﬁeld
of
algebraic
numbers.
Let
X
be
a
smooth,
proper,
connected
algebraic
curve
over
Q.
If
F
is
a
ﬁeld,
then
we
shall
denote
by
P1F
the
projective
line
over
F
.
Deﬁnition
1.1.
We
shall
refer
to
a
dominant
morphism
[of
Q-schemes]
φ
:
X
→
P1Q
as
a
Belyi
map
if
φ
is
unramiﬁed
over
the
open
subscheme
UP
⊆
P1Q
given
by
the
complement
of
the
points
“0”,
“1”,
and
“∞”
of
P1Q
;
in
this
case,
we
shall
refer
to
def
UX
=
φ−1
(UP
)
⊆
X
as
a
Belyi
open
of
X.
In
[1],
it
is
shown
that
X
always
admits
at
least
one
Belyi
open.
From
this
point
of
view,
the
main
result
(Theorem
2.5)
of
the
present
paper
has
as
an
immediate
formal
consequence
(pointed
out
to
the
author
by
A.
Tamagawa)
the
following
interesting
[and
representative]
result:
Corollary
1.2.
(Belyi
Opens
as
a
Zariski
Base)
If
VX
⊆
X
is
any
open
subscheme
of
X
containing
a
closed
point
x
∈
X,
then
there
exists
a
Belyi
open
UX
⊆
VX
⊆
X
such
that
x
∈
UX
.
In
particular,
the
Belyi
opens
of
X
form
a
base
for
the
Zariski
topology
of
X.

Section
2:
The
Main
Result
We
begin
with
some
elementary
lemmas:
(Separating
Properties
of
Belyi
Maps)
Let
C
∈
R
be
such
Lemma
2.1.
that
C
≥
2;
let
S
⊆
P1
(Q)
be
a
ﬁnite
set
of
rational
points
such
that:
(i)
0,
1,
∞
∈
S;
(ii)
there
exists
an
r
∈
S
such
that
0
<
r
<
1;
(iii)
every
α
∈
S
such
that
α
=
0,
r,
1,
∞
satisﬁes
α
>
1.
Suppose
that
β
∈
Q\S
satisﬁes
the
following
condition:
(iv)
β/α
≥
C,
for
all
α
∈
S\{0,
∞}.
Write
r
=
m/(m
+
n),
where
m,
n
≥
1
are
integers.
Then
the
function
def
f(x)
=
xm
·
(x
−
1)n
satisﬁes
the
following
properties:
(a)
f({0,
r,
1,
∞})
⊆
{0,
f(r),
∞};
(b)
f

(x)
=
0
(where
x
∈
C)
implies
x
∈
{0,
r,
1,
∞}
⊆
S;
(c)
f(β)
∈
/
f(S);
(d)
(f(β)
+
f0
)/(f(α)
+
f0
)
≥
C
for
all
α
∈
S\{∞}
such
that
f(α)
+
f0
=
0.
def
Here,
we
write
f0
=
−
minα
{f(α)},
where
α
ranges
over
the
elements
of
S\{∞}.
Proof.
Property
(a)
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions.
Property
(b)
follows
immediately
from
the
fact
that:
f

(x)
=
xm−1
·
(x
−
1)n−1
·
{(m
+
n)x
−
m}
This
computation
also
implies
that
for
real
x
>
1,
we
have
f

(x)
>
0,
hence
that
f(x)
is
monotone
increasing,
for
real
x
>
1.
In
particular,
since,
by
condition
(iv),
β
≥
C
·
α
≥
2
·
α
>
α,
for
all
α
∈
S\{0,
∞},
we
conclude
that
f(β)
>
f(α),
for
all
α
∈
S\{∞}
such
that
α
>
1.

Next,
observe
that
since
1
∈
S\{0,
∞},
condition
(iv)
implies
that
β
≥
C
≥
2,
so
f(β)
>
1.
Since
|f(x)|
≤
1
for
x
∈
[0,
1],
we
thus
conclude
that
f(β)
∈
/
f(S),
i.e.,
that
property
(c)
is
satisﬁed.
Next,
let
us
observe
the
following
property:
(e)
If
α
∈
S\{∞}
satisﬁes
α
>
1,
then
(β
−
1)/(α
−
1)
≥
β/α
≥
1;
f(β)/f(α)
≥
(β/α)2
≥
β/α.
[Indeed,
as
observed
above,
β
≥
α;
thus,
f(β)/f(α)
=
(β/α)m
·{(β
−1)/(α−1)}n
≥
(β/α)m+n
≥
(β/α)2
≥
β/α.]
Now
we
proceed
to
verify
property
(d)
as
follows:
Suppose
that
n
is
even.
Then
f(α)
≥
0,
for
all
α
∈
S\{∞},
so
f(0)
=
0
implies
that
f0
=
0.
Thus,
if
(S\{∞})
α
>
1,
then,
by
condition
(iv)
and
property
(e),
we
have:
f(β)/f(α)
≥
β/α
≥
C,
as
desired.
Since
f(0)
=
f(1)
=
0,
to
complete
the
proof
of
property
(d)
for
n
even,
it
suﬃces
to
observe
that
0
<
f(r)
≤
1,
so
f(β)/f(r)
≥
f(β)
=
β
m
·
(β
−
1)n
≥
β
≥
C
[since
β
≥
C
≥
2,
as
observed
above].
Now
suppose
that
n
is
odd.
Then
f(x)
≤
0
for
x
∈
[0,
1],
so
[since
f

(x)
=
0
for
x
∈
(0,
1)
⇐⇒
x
=
r]
we
conclude
that:
f0
=
|f(r)|
=
{m/(m
+
n)}m
·
{n/(m
+
n)}n
Note,
moreover,
that
this
expression
for
f0
implies
that
0
<
f0
≤
14
.
[Indeed,
this
is
immediate
in
the
following
three
cases:
m,
n
≥
2;
m
=
n
=
1;
one
of
m,
n
is
=
1
and
the
other
is
≥
3.
When
one
of
m,
n
is
=
1
and
the
other
is
=
2,
it
follows
from
the
fact
that
(
13
)
·
(
23
)2
≤
14
.]
Then
if
α
>
1,
then
either
f(α)
≥
f0
,
in
which
case
(f(β)
+
f0
)/(f(α)
+
f0
)
≥
f(β)/{2
·
f(α)}
≥
1
·
(β/α)2
≥
(β/α)
≥
C
2
[by
property
(e)]
or
f(α)
≤
f0
,
in
which
case
(f(β)
+
f0
)/(f(α)
+
f0
)
≥
f(β)/{2
·
f0
}
≥
2
·
f(β)
=
2β
m
(β
−
1)n
≥
β
≥
C
[since
0
<
f0
≤
14
,
β
≥
C
≥
2].
On
the
other
hand,
if
α
∈
{0,
1},
then
(f(β)
+
f0
)/(f(α)
+
f0
)
=
(f(β)
+
f0
)/f0
≥
f(β)
≥
β
m
·
(β
−
1)n
≥
β
≥
C
[since
β
≥
C
≥
2,
as
observed
above].
This
completes
the
proof
of
property
(d).

Suppose
that
β
∈
Q\S
satisﬁes
the
following
condition:
(iii)
β/α
≥
2,
for
all
α
∈
S\{0,
∞}.
Then
there
exists
a
nonconstant
polynomial
f(x)
∈
Q[x]
which
deﬁnes
a
morphism
φ
:
P1Q
→
P1Q
such
that:
(a)
φ(S)
⊆
{0,
1,
∞};
(b)
φ(β)
∈
/
{0,
1,
∞};
(c)
φ
is
unramiﬁed
over
1
PQ
\{0,
1,
∞}.
Proof.
Indeed,
we
induct
on
the
cardinality
|S|
of
S
and
apply
Lemma
2.1
[with,
say,
C
=
2]
to
the
set
λ
·
S
⊆
P1Q
,
for
some
appropriate
positive
rational
number
λ.
Then,
so
long
as
|S|
≥
4,
the
polynomial
“f(x)
+
f0
”
of
Lemma
2.1
determines
a
morphism
P1Q
→
P1Q
,
unramiﬁed
away
from
the
image
of
S,
that
maps
β,
S
to
some
β

,
S

that
satisfy
conditions
(i),
(ii),
(iii)
of
the
present
Lemma
2.2,
but
for
which
the
cardinalities
of
S

,
S
satisfy
|S

|
<
|S|.
Thus,
by
applying
the
induction
hypothesis
and
composing
the
resulting
morphisms
P1Q
→
P1Q
,
we
conclude
the
existence
of
an
“f”,
“φ”
as
in
the
statement
of
the
present
Lemma
2.2.
Lemma
2.3.
(Separation
of
Collections
of
Points)
Let
S
⊆
P1
(C)
be
a
ﬁnite
set
of
complex
points.
Then
for
any
real
C
>
0
and
β
∈
C\S
⊆
P1
(C)\S,
there
exists
a
λ
∈
C
such
that
the
rational
function
f(x)
=
1/(x
−
λ)
satisﬁes
f(β)
=
0,
∞;
f(α)
=
∞;
and
|f(β)|
≥
C
·
|f(α)|,
for
all
α
∈
S.
Moreover,
if
β
∈
Q,
then
one
may
take
λ
∈
Q.
Proof.
Indeed,
it
suﬃces
to
take
λ
such
|λ
−
β|
is
suﬃciently
small.
Lemma
2.4.
(Reduction
to
the
Rational
Case)
Write
Q
⊆
C
for
the
subset
of
algebraic
numbers.
Let
S
⊆
P1
(Q)
⊆
P1
(C)
be
a
ﬁnite
set
of
Q-rational
points.
Suppose
that
β
∈
Q\S.
Then
there
exists
a
nonconstant
rational
function
f(x)
∈
Q(x)
which
deﬁnes
a
morphism
φ
:
P1Q
→
P1Q
such
that,
for
some
Sφ
⊆
P1
(Q),
we
have:
(a)
φ(S)
⊆
Sφ
;
(b)
φ(β)
∈
P1
(Q)\Sφ
;
(c)
φ
is
unramiﬁed
over
P1Q
\Sφ
.
Moreover,
if
S,
β
are
deﬁned
over
a
number
ﬁeld
F
,
then
φ
may
be
taken
to
be
deﬁned
over
F
.

Proof.
First
of
all,
we
observe
that
by
applying
the
automorphism
x
→
x
−
β,
we
may
assume
that
β
∈
P1
(Q).
Moreover,
under
the
hypothesis
that
β
∈
P1
(Q),
we
shall
construct
a
f(x)
satisfying
the
required
conditions
such
that
f(x)
∈
Q(x).
Also,
we
may
replace
S
by
the
union
of
all
Gal(Q/Q)-conjugates
of
S
and
assume,
without
loss
of
generality,
that
S
is
Gal(Q/Q)-stable.
If
F
is
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Q,
then
let
us
refer
to
the
number
[F
:
Q]
−
1
as
the
reduced
degree
of
F
.
Write
m(S)
for
the
maximum
of
the
reduced
degrees
of
the
ﬁelds
of
deﬁnition
of
the
various
points
contained
in
S
and
d(S)
for
the
sum
of
those
reduced
degrees
of
the
ﬁelds
of
deﬁnition
of
the
various
points
contained
in
S
which
are
equal
to
m(S).
Thus,
d(S)
=
0
if
and
only
if
m(S)
=
0
if
and
only
if
S
⊆
P1
(Q).
Now
we
perform
a
“nested
induction”
on
m(S),
d(S):
That
is
to
say,
we
induct
on
m(S),
and,
for
each
ﬁxed
value
of
m(S),
we
induct
on
d(S).
If
m(S),
d(S)
=
0,
def
then
let
α0
∈
S\P1
(Q)
be
such
that
d0
=
[Q(α0
)
:
Q]
is
equal
to
m(S)+
1.
Then
by
applying
an
automorphism
(with
rational
coeﬃcients!)
as
in
Lemma
2.3
and
then
multiplying
by
some
positive
rational
number,
we
may
assume
that
|α|
≤
1,
for
all
α
∈
S\{∞},
while
|β|
≥
C,
for
some
suﬃciently
large
C,
where
“suﬃciently
large”
is
relative
to
d0
.
Let
f0
(x)
∈
Q[x]
be
the
monic
minimal
polynomial
for
α0
over
Q.
Then
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
all
of
the
coeﬃcients
of
f0
(x)
have
absolute
value
≤
dd00
.
In
particular,
it
follows
that
the
value
of
f0
at
every
α
∈
S\{∞},
as
well
as
at
every
element
of
the
set
S0
of
roots
of
the
derivative
f0
(x)
has
absolute
value
bounded
by
some
ﬁxed
expression
in
d0
.
Thus,
for
a
suitable
choice
of
C,
it
follows

def
/
S

=
f0
(S)
f0
(S0
).
Moreover,
since
f0
(α0
)
=
0;
[Q(α
)
:
Q]
<
d0
for
that
f0
(β)
∈
every
α
∈
f0
(S0
)
[since
f0
(x),
f0
(x)
∈
Q[x];
f0
(x)
has
degree
≤
d0
−
1],
it
follows
that
S

is
Gal(Q/Q)-stable
and
satisﬁes
the
property
that
either
m(S

)
<
m(S)
or
m(S

)
=
m(S);
d(S

)
<
d(S)
—
thus
completing
the
induction
step.
In
particular,
replacing
S
by
S

,
β
by
f0
(β),
applying
the
induction
hypothesis,
and
composing
the
resulting
morphisms
yields
a
morphism
φ
as
in
the
statement
of
Lemma
2.4.

(c)
we

Moreover,
if

are
deﬁned
over
a

ﬁeld
F
,
then
φ
may
be
taken
to
be
deﬁned
over

.
Proof.
Since
X(Q)
is
inﬁnite,
we
may
always
adjoin
to
T
extra
points
of
X(Q)
that
do
not
lie
in
S;
in
particular,
we
may
assume,
without
loss
of
generality,
that
T
has
cardinality
≥
2gX
+
1,
where
gX
is
the
genus
of
X.
Write
def
D
=

[t]
t∈T
for
the
eﬀective
divisor
on
X
obtained
by
taking
the
formal
sum
of
the

,
each
with
multiplicity
one;
denote
the

and
the

for
the

whose
zero

Thus,
the
degree
deg(L)
of
L
is
≥

≥

In

if
x

Since,
by
Serre
duality,
Γ(X,
ωX
⊗
L−1
(x))
is
dual
to
H
1
(X,
L(−x)),
we
thus
conclude
that
H
1
(X,
L(−x))
=
0.
Now
if
we
consider
the
long
exact
cohomology
sequence
associated
to
the
exact
sequence
of
coherent
sheaves
on
X
0
→
L(−x)
→
L
→
L
⊗
k(x)
→
0
[where
k(x)
is
the
residue
ﬁeld
of
X
at
x]
we
obtain
an
exact
sequence
.
.
.
→
Γ(X,
L)
→
L
⊗
k(x)
→
H
1
(X,
L(−x))
→
.
.
.
—
i.e.,
we
have
a
surjection
Γ(X,
L)

L
⊗
k(x).
Since
Q
is
inﬁnite,
it
thus
follows
that
there
exists
an
s1
∈
Γ(X,
L)
such
that
s1
(t)
=
0
for
all
t
∈
T
.
Thus,
the
linear
series
determined
by
the
sections
s0
,
s1
of
L
has
no
basepoints,
hence
determines
a
ﬁnite
morphism
ψ
:
X
→
P1Q
such
that
the
pull-back
by
ψ
of
the
unique
[up
to
isomorphism]
line
bundle
of
degree
1
on
P1Q
is
isomorphic
to
L;
ψ
maps
every
t
∈
T
to
the
point
“0”
of
P1Q
.
Moreover,
since
every
point
of
the
support
of
D
has
multiplicity
one
in
D,
ψ
is
unramiﬁed
over
the
point
“0”
of
P1Q
;
since
no
point
of
S
lies
in
the
support
of
D,
this
point
“0”
of
P1Q
does
not
lie
in
the
set
ψ(S).
Thus,
in
summary,
by
replacing
X
by
P1Q
,
T
by
the
point
“0”
of
P1Q
,
and
S
by
the
union
of
ψ(S)
and
the
points
of
P1Q
over
which
ψ
ramiﬁes,
we
conclude
that
we
may
reduce
to
the
case
X
=
P1Q
,
T
=
{β},
for
some
β
∈
P1
(Q)\{∞}.
Next,
by
applying
Lemma
2.4,
one
reduces
to
the
case
X
=
P1Q
,
S
⊆
P1
(Q),
T
=
{β},
for
some
β
∈
P1
(Q)\{∞}.
Finally,
by
applying
an
automorphism
as
in
Lemma
2.3

where
ν

and
μ

gives
rise
to
a
situation
in
which
the
hypotheses
of

are
valid.
Thus,
Theorem

follows
from
Lemma

Let

a

and
S

a

Then
there

there

such
that

Proof.
Note
that
we

think
of
T
as
a
Q-valued
point
of
the
n-fold
product
def
Y
=
(X\S)n
of
(X\S)

Then
observe
that
for

that:

we
write

Moreover,
by
Theorem
2.5,
the
Uφ
cover
Y
(Q)
[i.e.,
as
φ
varies
over
those
morphisms
satisfying
the
conditions
(a),
(b)].
Since
Y

quasi-compact,
we
thus
conclude

as

In
the
following,
we
shall
refer
to
as
a

Proof.
As
in
the
proof
of
Corollary
3.1,
write
Y
=
X
n
for
the
n-fold
product
def
X
over
F
,
where
we
set
n
=
c
·
d.
Thus,
for
any
T
⊆
X(Q)
as
in
the
statement
of
Corollary
3.2,
(v),
the
conjugates
over
F
of
the
various
x
∈
T
[in
any
order,
with
possible
repetition]
form
a
point
∈
Y
(Q).
Let
Lv
be
a

compact
ﬁeld
containing
Fv
,
as
well
as
all
Q-conjugates
of
all

of

Then
observe
that
for

all

and

the

v∈V

for
which
φ(y)
{0,

=

[by
abuse
of
notation,
as
in
the
proof
of
Corollary
3.1]
is
nonempty
and
open
relative
to
the
product
topology
of
the
Zariski
topologies
on
the
Y
(Lv

hence
a
fortiori,
relative
to
the
product
topology
of
the
topologies
on
the
Y
(Lv

determined
by
the
Lv
.
Moreover,
by
arguing
as
in
the
proof
of
Corollary
3.1
using
Theorem
2.5
and
the
Zariski
topology,
we
may
assume
that
the
Lv
are
suﬃciently
large
that
[in
fact,
ﬁnitely
many]
such
Uφ
cover
Y
(LV
).
Now
since
each
Uφ
is
locally
compact
and
contains
a
countable
dense
subset,
it
follows
that
each
Uφ
admits
an
exhaustive
chain
of
open
subsets
Vφ,1

Uφ

j
Vφ,j
=
Uφ
]
such
that
the
closure
V
φ,j
in
Uφ
of
each
Vφ,j
is
compact.
On
the
other
hand,
since
Y
is
proper,
it
follows
that
Y
(LV
)
is
compact.
We
thus
conclude
that
there
exist
ﬁnitely
many
φ1

φN

that
Y
