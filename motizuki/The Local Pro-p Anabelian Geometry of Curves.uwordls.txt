The

Anabelian
Geometry
of
Curves

INTRODUCTION
The
Anabelian
Geometry
of
Grothendieck:
Let
X
be
a
connected
scheme.
Then
one
can
associate
(after
Grothendieck)
to
X
its
algebraic
fundamental
group
π1
(X).
This
group
π1
(X)
is
a
proﬁnite
group
which
is
uniquely
determined
(up
to
inner
automorphisms)
by
the
property
that
the
category
of
ﬁnite,
discrete
sets
equipped
with
a
continuous
π1
(X)-action
is
equivalent
to
the
category
of
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
X.
Moreover,
the
assignment
X
→
π1
(X)
is
a
functor
from
the
category
of
connected
schemes
(and
morphisms
of
schemes)
to
the
category
of
proﬁnite
topological
groups
and
continuous
outer
homomorphisms
(i.e.,
continuous
homomorphisms
of
topological
groups,
where
we
identify
any
two
homomorphisms
that
can
be
obtained
from
one
another
by
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism).
Now
let
K
be
a
ﬁeld.
Let
ΓK
be
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
K.
Then
π1
(Spec(K))
may
be
identiﬁed
with
ΓK
.
Let
XK
be
a
variety
(i.e.,
a
geometrically
integral
separated
scheme
of
ﬁnite
type)
over
K.
Then
the
structure
morphism
XK
→
Spec(K)
deﬁnes
a
natural
augmentation
π1
(XK
)
→
ΓK
.
The
kernel
of
this
morphism
π1
(XK
)
→
ΓK
is
a
closed
normal
subgroup
of
π1
(XK
)
–
called
the
geometric
fundamental
group
of
XK
–
def
which
may
be
identiﬁed
with
π1
(XK
)
(where
XK
=
XK
⊗K
K).
If,
moreover,
one
ﬁxes
a
prime
number
p,
then
one
can
form
the
maximal
pro-p
quotient
π1
(XK
)(p)
of
π1
(XK
).
Since
the
quotient
π1
(XK
)
→
π1
(XK
)(p)
is
characteristic,
it
follows
that
the
kernel
of
this
quotient
is,
in
fact,
a
normal
subgroup
of
π1
(XK
).
The
quotient
of
π1
(XK
)
by
this
normal
subgroup
will
be
denoted
ΠXK
.
Thus,
ΠXK
inherits
a
natural
augmentation
ΠXK
→
ΓK
from
that
of
π1
(XK
).
Now
let
us
consider
the
assignment
π1
(−)K
:
{XK
→
Spec(K)}
→
{π1
(XK
)
→
ΓK
}
This
assignment
deﬁnes
a
functor
from
the
category
CK
of
K-varieties
(whose
morphisms
are
K-linear
morphisms
of
varieties)
to
the
category
GK
whose
objects
are
proﬁnite
topological
groups
equipped
with
an
augmentation
to
ΓK
,
and
whose
morphisms
are
continuous
outer
homomorphisms
of
topological
groups
that
lie
over
ΓK
.
It
was
the
intuition
of
Grothendieck
(see
[Groth])
that:
1
For
certain
types
of
K,
if
one
replaces
CK
and
GK
by
“certain
appro


and
GK
(such
that
π1
(−)K
still
maps
CK
into
priate”
subcategories
CK

GK
),
then
π1
(−)K
should
be
fully
faithful.

Here,
the
“certain
appropriate”
subcategories
CK
for
which
this
piece
of
intuition
was
to
hold
true
were
tentatively
assigned
the
appellation
anabelian,
while
the
piece
of
intuition
itself
came
to
be
referred
to
as
Grothendieck’s
Conjecture
of
Anabelian
Geometry
(or,
simply,
the
“Grothendieck
Conjecture,”
for
short).
Roughly
speaking,
the
sorts
of
varieties
that
were
thought
to
be
likely
to
be
“anabelian”
were
varieties
that
are
“suﬃciently
hyperbolic.”
(Note
that,
as
one
can
see
in
the
case
of
curves,
hyperbolic
varieties
tend
to
have
highly
nonabelian
fundamental
groups,
hence
the
term
“anabelian.”
In
higher
dimensions,
however,
things
are
not
so
simple
–
see,
e.g.,
[IN].)
A
variant
of
the
above
“proﬁnite”
Grothendieck
Conjecture
is
the
following
“prop”
Grothendieck
Conjecture:
Namely,
instead
of
considering
π1
(−)K
,
one
considers
the
functor
that
assigns
to
the
K-variety
XK
the
augmented
group
ΠXK
→
ΓK
.
The
“pro-p”
Grothendieck
Conjecture
then
asserts
that,
in
certain
situations,
this
functor
should
be
fully
faithful.
The
present
paper
is
concerned
with
proving
various
versions
of
the
proﬁnite
and
pro-p
Grothendieck
Conjectures
under
various
conditions.
Statement
of
the
Main
Results:
Let
p
be
a
prime
number.
Let
K
be
a
sub-p-adic
ﬁeld
(cf.
Deﬁnition
15.4
(i)),
i.e.,
a
subﬁeld
of
a
ﬁnitely
generated
ﬁeld
extension
of
Qp
.
In
this
paper,
we
prove
a
pro-p
version
of
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
(Theorem
A)
for
dominant
morphisms
between
“smooth
pro-varieties”
and
“hyperbolic
pro-curves”
over
K.
(Here,
by
a
“smooth
pro-variety”
(respectively,
“hyperbolic
pro-curve”)
over
K,
we
mean
a
K-scheme
which
can
be
written
as
a
projective
limit
of
smooth
varieties
(respectively,
hyperbolic
curves)
over
K
in
which
the
transition
morphisms
are
birational
–
cf.
Deﬁnitions
15.4
(ii)
and
16.4.)
We
then
give
various
versions
of
Theorem
A
(namely,
Theorems
A
and
A
)
for
truncated
fundamental
groups.
From
Theorem
A,
we
also
derive
a
proﬁnite
version
of
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
(Theorem
B)
for
morphisms
between
function
ﬁelds
(of
arbitrary
dimension)
over
K.
Next,
we
apply
Theorem
A
to
prove
the
“injectivity
part”
(Theorem
C)
of
the
pro-p
“Section
Conjecture.”
Finally,
in
an
Appendix,
we
derive
from
Theorem
A
an
isomorphism
version
of
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
for
certain
hyperbolic
surfaces
(Theorem
D).
def
Notation:
If
K
is
a
ﬁeld
and
XK
is
a
K-scheme,
we
denote
by
Πprf
XK
=
π1
(XK
)
the
fundamental
group
of
XK
(for
some
choice
of
base-point),
and
by
ΓK
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
K.
Then
we
have
a
natural
morphism
Πprf
XK
→
ΓK
whose
kernel
is
the
geometric
prf
prf
fundamental
group
ΔX
⊆
ΠXK
.
Let
ΔX
be
the
maximal
pro-p
quotient
of
Δprf
X
.
Then
prf
prf
the
kernel
of
ΔX
→
ΔX
is
a
normal
subgroup
of
ΠXK
,
so
by
forming
the
quotient
of
Πprf
XK
by
this
normal
subgroup,
we
obtain
a
group
ΠXK
,
together
with
a
morphism
ΠXK
→
ΓK
def
whose
kernel
is
ΔX
.
Next,
if
Δ
is
a
topological
group,
we
let:
Δ{0}
=
Δ;
for
i
≥
1,
def
Δ{i}
=
[Δ{i
−
1},
Δ{i
−
1}]
(here
we
mean
“the
closed
subgroup
generated
by
the
purely
2
group-theoretic
commutator
subgroup”).
In
the
speciﬁc
case
of
fundamental
groups,
let
us
write
“Πi
”
(respectively,
“Δi
”)
for
Π/Δ{i}
(respectively,
Δ/Δ{i}).
Our
ﬁrst
main
theorem
is
the
following:
Theorem
A.
Let
p
be
a
prime
number.
Let
K
be
sub-p-adic
(cf.
Deﬁnition
15.4
(i)).
Let
XK
be
a
smooth
pro-variety
over
K.
Let
YK
be
a
hyperbolic
pro-curve
over
K.
Let
Homdom
K
(XK
,
YK
)
be
the
set
of
dominant
K-morphisms
from
XK
to
YK
.
Let
open
prf
prf
HomΓK
(ΠXK
,
ΠYK
)
(respectively,
Homopen
ΓK
(ΠXK
,
ΠYK
)),
be
the
set
of
open,
continuous
prf
group
homomorphisms
ΠXK
→
ΠYK
(respectively,
Πprf
XK
→
ΠYK
)
over
ΓK
,
considered
up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
arising
from
ΔY
(respectively,
Δprf
Y
).
Then
the
natural
maps
open
prf
prf
Homdom
K
(XK
,
YK
)
→
HomΓK
(ΠXK
,
ΠYK
)
→
Homopen
ΓK
(ΠXK
,
ΠYK
)
are
bijective.
This
Theorem
is
given
as
Theorem
16.5
(cf.
also
the
Remark
following
Theorem
16.5)
in
the
text.
It
is
from
Theorem
A
that
all
of
the
other
major
results
of
this
paper
are
derived.
We
remark
that:
(1)
In
fact,
really,
the
main
portion
of
Theorem
A
is
the
bijectivity
of
the
ﬁrst
and
third
Hom’s.
That
is
to
say,
the
bijectivity
of
the
ﬁrst
and
second
Hom’s
follows
formally
from
the
bijectivity
of
the
ﬁrst
and
third
Hom’s.
See
the
Remark
following
Theorem
16.5
for
more
details.
(2)
The
notion
of
a
“smooth
pro-variety”
(respectively,
“hyperbolic
procurve”)
has
as
special
cases:
(i)
a
smooth
variety
(respectively,
hyperbolic
curve)
over
K;
(ii)
the
spectrum
of
a
function
ﬁeld
of
arbitrary
dimension
(respectively,
function
ﬁeld
of
dimension
one)
over
K.
(3)
There
exists
a
substantial
body
of
people
who,
when
they
speak
of
“the
Grothendieck
Conjecture”
(respectively,
“the
pro-p
Grothendieck
Conjecture”),
refer
to
the
following
rather
speciﬁc
statement
(which
is
a
special
case
of
the
general
philosophy
discussed
in
the
preceding
subsection):
If
K
is
a
ﬁnitely
generated
extension
of
Q,
and
XK
and
YK
are
either
hyperbolic
curves
over
K
or
the
spectra
of
one-dimensional
function
ﬁelds
over
K,
then
the
isomorphisms
of
XK
with
YK
are
in
natural
bijective
correspondence
with
the
outer
isomorphisms
over
ΓK
of
prf
Πprf
XK
(respectively,
ΠXK
)
with
ΠYK
(respectively,
ΠYK
).
This
statement
is
manifestly
a
special
case
of
the
proﬁnite
version
–
see
(1)
above
–
(respectively,
pro-p
version,
i.e.,
version
as
stated
above)
of
Theorem
A.
3
We
also
have
truncated
versions
of
Theorem
A
(Theorems
18.1
and
18.2
in
the
text):
Theorem
A
.
Let
K
be
sub-p-adic.
Let
XK
be
a
smooth
variety
over
K.
Let
YK
be
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
K.
Let
n
≥
5.
Then
every
continuous
open
homomorphism
θ
:
ΠnXK
→
ΠnYK
over
ΓK
induces
a
dominant
morphism
μ
:
XK
→
YK
whose
induced
morphism
on
fundamental
groups
coincides
(up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
arising
from
n−3
ΔYK
)
with
the
morphism
Δn−3
XK
→
ΔYK
deﬁned
by
considering
θ
“modulo
Δ{n
−
3}.”
Let
K
be
sub-p-adic.
Let
XK
be
a
smooth
pro-variety
over
K.
Let
YK
Theorem
A
.
be
a
hyperbolic
pro-curve
over
K.
Let
n0
be
the
minimum
transcendence
degree
over
Qp
of
all
ﬁnitely
generated
ﬁeld
extensions
of
Qp
that
contain
K.
Let
n0
be
the
transcendence
def
degree
over
K
of
the
function
ﬁeld
of
XK
.
Let
n0
=
n0
+
2(n0
−
1)
+
1.
Let
n
≥
3n0
+
5.
Then
every
continuous
open
homomorphism
θ
:
ΠnXK
→
ΠnYK
over
ΓK
induces
a
dominant
morphism
μ
:
XK
→
YK
whose
induced
morphism
on
fundamental
groups
coincides
(up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
arising
0
0
→
Δn−3−3n
deﬁned
by
considering
θ
“modfrom
ΔYK
)
with
the
morphism
Δn−3−3n
XK
YK
ulo
Δ{n
−
3
−
3n0
}.”
Our
second
main
theorem
(Theorem
17.1
in
the
text)
is
the
following:
Theorem
B.
Let
p
be
a
prime
number.
Let
K
be
sub-p-adic.
Let
L
and
M
be
function
ﬁelds
of
arbitrary
dimension
over
K.
(In
particular,
we
assume
that
K
is
algebraically
closed
in
L
and
M.)
Let
HomK
(Spec(L),
Spec(M))
be
the
set
of
K-morphisms
from
M
to
L.
Let
Homopen
ΓK
(ΓL
,
ΓM
)
be
the
set
of
open,
continuous
group
homomorphisms
ΓL
→
ΓM
over
ΓK
,
considered
up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
arising
from
Ker(ΓM
→
ΓK
).
Then
the
natural
map
HomK
(Spec(L),
Spec(M))
→
Homopen
ΓK
(ΓL
,
ΓM
)
is
bijective.
Note
that
in
characteristic
zero,
this
generalizes
the
results
of
[Pop1],
[Pop2],
where
a
similar
result
to
Theorem
B
is
obtained,
except
that
the
morphisms
ΓL
→
ΓM
are
required
to
be
isomorphisms,
and
K
is
required
to
be
ﬁnitely
generated
over
Q.
4
Our
third
main
theorem
(Theorem
19.1
in
the
text)
is
the
following:
Theorem
C.
Let
p
be
a
prime
number.
Let
K
be
sub-p-adic.
Let
XK
be
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
K.
Let
XK
(K)
be
the
set
of
K-valued
points
of
XK
.
Let
Sect(ΓK
,
ΠXK
)
be
the
set
of
sections
ΓK
→
ΠXK
of
ΠXK
→
ΓK
,
considered
up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
arising
from
ΔX
.
Then
the
natural
map
XK
(K)
→
Sect(ΓK
,
ΠXK
)
is
injective.
Finally,
in
the
Appendix,
we
use
Theorem
A
to
derive
the
following
result:
Theorem
D.
Let
p
be
a
prime
number.
Let
K
be
sub-p-adic.
Let
XK
and
YK
be
hyperbolically
ﬁbred
surfaces
(see
Deﬁnition
a2.1
in
the
Appendix
for
a
precise
deﬁnition
of
this
term)
over
K.
Let
IsomK
(XK
,
YK
)
be
the
set
of
K-isomorphisms
(in
the
category
prf
of
K-schemes)
between
XK
and
YK
.
Let
IsomΓK
(Πprf
XK
,
ΠYK
)
be
the
set
of
continuous
prf
group
isomorphisms
Πprf
XK
→
ΠYK
over
ΓK
,
considered
up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
arising
from
Δprf
Y
.
Then
the
natural
map
prf
IsomK
(XK
,
YK
)
→
IsomΓK
(Πprf
XK
,
ΠYK
)
is
bijective.
Recent
Work
on
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture:
In
this
subsection,
we
would
like
to
take
a
brief
look
at
recent
work
on
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture.
We
will
concentrate
only
on
major
and
recent
(since
the
early
1980’s)
developments
that
relate
to
the
present
paper,
and
we
make
no
pretense
of
giving
a
complete
history
of
work
on
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture.
Before
beginning,
it
is
worth
pointing
out
that
until
the
appearance
of
the
present
paper
(and
its
earlier
version
[Mzk2]),
it
was
widely
assumed
that
the
base
ﬁeld
“K”
that
appears
in
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
should
be
assumed
to
be
ﬁnitely
generated
over
Q.
It
is
not
clear
precisely
why
this
came
to
be
assumed
by
most
people
working
in
the
ﬁeld,
but
one
possible
cause
is
that
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
appears
to
have
originated
as
an
alternative
approach
to
diophantine
geometry
([Groth],
[Pop3]).
Thus,
if
one’s
ultimate
aim
is
applications
to
diophantine
geometry,
it
is
quite
natural
only
to
look
at
global
ﬁelds
(i.e.,
ﬁnitely
generated
extensions
of
Q),
and
not
at
p-adic
local
ﬁelds,
for
instance.
Another
reason
for
the
ﬁxation
on
ﬁnitely
generated
extensions
of
Q
appears
to
have
been
that
many
people
conceived
of
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
as
an
anabelian
version
5
of
the
Tate
Conjecture
(Faltings’
theorem
–
see
[Falt3])
for
abelian
varieties
over
number
ﬁelds.
In
fact,
this
point
of
view
became
so
deeply
engrained
that
it
gave
rise
to
a
tendency
for
people
to
try
to
prove
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
for
hyperbolic
curves
over
number
ﬁelds
by
deducing
it
from
the
Tate
Conjecture
for
abelian
varieties
over
number
ﬁelds
(see,
e.g.,
[Naka3]).
In
fact,
even
important
early
work
–
such
as
[Naka1]
on
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
for
genus
zero
hyperbolic
curves
over
number
ﬁelds,
or
[Pop1],
[Pop2]
which
treat
the
birational
case
–
which
does
not
try
to
deduce
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
from
the
Tate
Conjecture
still
had
a
distinctly
global
ﬂavor,
and
relied
extensively
on
essentially
global
techniques.
These
global
techniques
ultimately
proved
to
be
rather
irrelevant
to
the
proof
of
the
main
results
of
the
present
paper.
Nevertheless,
what
was
important
(from
the
point
of
view
of
the
author)
about
the
work
of
H.
Nakamura
was
that
it
established
a
host
of
basic
techniques
for
studying
the
outer
Galois
action
on
the
(nonabelian)
geometric
fundamental
group
of
a
hyperbolic
curve,
which
was
unknown
territory
to
most
arithmetic
geometers,
who
were
only
familiar
with
the
Galois
action
on
the
abelian
fundamental
group
of
an
abelian
variety.
It
was
this
culture
of
basic
techniques
(due
to
H.
Nakamura)
which
permitted
the
subsequent
development
of
more
powerful
approaches
to
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
itself,
as
discussed
below.
The
next
important
development
(in
early
1995)
was
the
work
of
A.
Tamagawa
([Tama])
in
which
it
was
shown
that
the
isomorphism
class
of
any
aﬃne
hyperbolic
curve
over
an
absolutely
ﬁnitely
generated
ﬁeld
is
functorially
determined
by
the
outer
Galois
action
on
its
proﬁnite
geometric
fundamental
group.
(In
fact,
by
a
relatively
straightforward
argument
([Mzk1]),
it
is
possible
to
remove
the
“aﬃneness”
hypothesis
in
Tamagawa’s
result,
at
least
in
characteristic
zero.)
Unlike
the
results
of
the
present
paper,
Tamagawa’s
result
holds
in
positive
characteristic
as
well
as
in
characteristic
zero.
Moreover,
Tamagawa’s
ideas
on
characterizing
those
sections
of
π1
(XK
)
→
ΓK
(where
XK
is
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
a
ﬁeld
K)
that
arise
from
geometric
points
of
XK
played
a
pivotal
role
in
inspiring
the
author
to
prove
the
results
of
the
present
paper.
Concretely
speaking,
the
inﬂuence
of
these
ideas
of
Tamagawa
can
be
seen
in
the
argument
of
Section
9
of
the
present
paper.
Finally,
we
turn
to
discussing
the
results
of
the
present
paper
in
a
historical
context.
As
observed
previously,
the
results
of
the
present
paper
are
(unlike
Tamagawa’s
results)
only
valid
in
characteristic
zero.
On
the
other
hand,
the
main
advances
of
Theorem
A
of
the
present
paper
relative
to
[Tama]
are
as
follows:
(1)
The
hyperbolic
curves
involved
are
allowed
to
be
proper.
In
fact,
we
even
allow
what
we
call
hyperbolic
pro-curves.
(2)
Instead
of
dealing
with
proﬁnite
geometric
fundamental
groups,
we
deal
with
pro-p
geometric
fundamental
groups.
Pro-p
results
tend
to
be
stronger
than
proﬁnite
results
in
the
sense
that
proﬁnite
results
usually
follow
immediately
from
pro-p
results
(see
the
Remark
following
Theorem
16.5
for
more
details).
(3)
Instead
of
just
considering
isomorphisms,
we
allow
arbitrary
dominant
morphisms
between
the
varieties
involved.
6
(4)
The
variety
“on
the
left”
(in
the
“Hom(−,
−)”
of
Theorem
A)
is
allowed
to
be
higher-dimensional,
and
need
not
even
be
hyperbolic.
(5)
The
base
ﬁeld
can
be
any
subﬁeld
of
a
ﬁnitely
generated
extension
of
Qp
,
whereas
for
Tamagawa
(in
characteristic
zero)
the
base
ﬁeld
must
be
a
ﬁnitely
generated
extension
of
Q.
From
the
point
of
view
of
the
author,
(5)
is
the
most
fundamental
and
important
advance
as
it
is
associated
with
the
fact
that
the
techniques
of
the
present
paper
are
fundamentally
diﬀerent
from
those
of
both
Nakamura
and
Tamagawa
in
that
they
are
couched
in
the
world
of
p-adic
Hodge
theory.
That
is
to
say,
the
proof
of
Theorem
A
may
be
regarded
as
an
application
of
the
theory
of
[Falt1]
and
[BK].
It
is
precisely
the
use
of
these
p-adic
techniques
that
allowed
the
author
to
prove
a
result
which
was
much
stronger
(in
the
above
ﬁve
senses)
than
the
result
of
[Tama]
(in
characteristic
zero)
or
[Mzk1].
Moreover,
it
is
the
opinion
of
the
author
that:
The
reason
that
it
took
so
long
for
Theorem
A
to
be
discovered
was
the
overwhelming
prejudice
of
most
people
in
the
ﬁeld
that
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
for
hyperbolic
curves
is
an
essentially
global
result,
akin
to
the
Tate
Conjecture
for
abelian
varieties
over
number
ﬁelds.
In
fact,
however,
it
is
much
more
natural
to
regard
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
for
hyperbolic
curves
as
an
essentially
local,
p-adic
result
that
belongs
to
that
branch
of
arithmetic
geometry
known
as
p-adic
Hodge
theory.
Moreover,
it
is
the
feeling
of
the
author
that,
more
than
the
technical
details
of
the
statement
of
Theorem
A,
it
is
this
fact
–
i.e.,
that
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
for
hyperbolic
curves
is
best
understood
not
as
a
global,
number-theoretic
result,
but
rather
as
a
result
in
p-adic
Hodge
theory
–
that
is
the
central
discovery
of
this
paper.
The
Structure
of
the
Proof:
First,
we
remark
that
most
of
the
paper
(Sections
1
through
14)
is
devoted
to
proving
the
following
technical
result:
(∗)tech
Suppose
that
K
is
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
.
Let
XK
and
YK
be
proper
hyperbolic
curves
over
K.
Let
UK
be
the
spectrum
of
the
function
ﬁeld
of
XK
.
Then
every
continuous
surjective
homomorphism
θ
:
ΠUK
→
ΠYK
over
ΓK
arises
from
some
geometric
morphism
UK
→
YK
.
Section
15
is
devoted
to
the
rather
standard
technicalities
necessary
to
generalize
(∗)tech
to
the
case
where
K
is
any
subﬁeld
of
a
ﬁnitely
generated
extension
of
Qp
.
Section
16
is
devoted
to
carrying
out
a
standard
“cutting
by
hyperplane
sections
argument”
which
allows
one
to
replace
UK
by
a
higher-dimensional
smooth
pro-variety
(which
thus
completes
7
the
proof
of
Theorem
A).
Section
17
is
devoted
to
an
induction
argument
used
to
derive
Theorem
B
from
Theorem
A.
Section
18
discusses
how
the
techniques
used
to
prove
Theorem
A
in
fact
also
give
rise
to
the
truncated
versions
Theorem
A
and
Theorem
A
.
Finally,
Section
19
reviews
a
standard
argument
(already
present
in
the
work
of
H.
Nakamura)
which
allows
one
to
derive
Theorem
C
from
Theorem
A.
Thus,
the
rest
of
this
subsection
will
be
devoted
to
outlining
the
proof
of
(∗)tech
in
Sections
1
through
14.
In
order
to
simplify
the
discussion,
let
us
consider
ﬁrst
the
following
slightly
modiﬁed
version
of
(∗)tech
:
(∗)prop
Suppose
that
K
is
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
.
Let
XK
and
YK
be
proper
hyperbolic
curves
over
K.
Then
every
continuous
surjective
homomorphism
θ
:
ΠXK
→
ΠYK
over
ΓK
arises
from
some
geometric
morphism
XK
→
YK
.
(Here,
“prop”
stands
for
“proper”
–
i.e.,
since,
unlike
in
(∗)tech
,
where
UK
appeared,
in
(∗)prop
only
proper
curves
appear.)
Thus,
(∗)tech
implies
(∗)prop
.
In
other
words,
(up
to
some
standard
general
nonsense)
one
may
think
of
(∗)tech
as
the
concatenation
of
(∗)prop
with
the
following
assertion:
(∗)iner
Any
θ
:
ΠUK
→
ΠYK
as
in
(∗)tech
necessarily
factors
through
the
quotient
ΠUK
→
ΠXK
.
(Here,
“iner”
stands
for
“inertia”
–
since
the
kernel
of
ΠUK
→
ΠXK
is
generated
by
inertia
groups,
so
(∗)iner
is
the
assertion
that
θ
:
ΠUK
→
ΠYK
always
sends
inertia
groups
in
ΠUK
to
the
identity.)
We
will
come
back
to
the
issue
of
(∗)iner
later,
but
for
now,
let
us
concentrate
on
outlining
the
proof
of
(∗)prop
,
since
it
is
this
which
is
the
core
of
the
paper.
Thus,
let
us
assume
that
we
have
been
given
a
continuous
surjective
homomorphism:
θ
:
ΠXK
→
ΠYK
over
ΓK
.
We
would
like
to
somehow
manufacture
out
of
θ
a
morphism
from
XK
to
YK
.
A
natural,
naive
way
to
start
is
the
following:
First,
by
replacing
XK
and
YK
by
appropriate
étale
coverings,
we
may
assume
that
neither
is
hyperelliptic
(see,
e.g.,
Lemma
10.4
(4)).
Let
us
write
DX
(respectively,
DY
)
for
H
0
(XK
,
ωXK
/K
)
(respectively,
H
0
(YK
,
ωYK
/K
)),
the
space
of
global
diﬀerentials
on
XK
(respectively,
YK
).
Then
it
is
well-known
that
XK
def
(respectively,
YK
)
embeds
naturally
in
the
projective
space
PX
=
P(DX
)
(respectively,
def
PY
=
P(DY
)).
Moreover,
since
the
p-adic
étale
cohomology
of
XK
or
YK
can
be
computed
as
the
group
cohomology
of
the
respective
pro-p
geometric
fundamental
group,
it
follows
that
the
surjection
θ
induces
a
ΓK
-equivariant
injection
θH
:
H
1
(YK
,
Qp
)
→
H
1
(XK
,
Qp
)
8
Moreover,
it
is
well-known
(see,
e.g.,
[Falt1],
[Tate])
that
the
ΓK
-module
H
1
(XK
,
Qp
)
is
Hodge-Tate,
and,
moreover,
that
if
we
tensor
H
1
(XK
,
Qp
)
over
Qp
with
Cp
(1)
(where
the
“(1)”
is
a
“Tate
twist”),
and
take
ΓK
-invariants,
we
naturally
recover
the
space
DX
of
diﬀerentials.
Thus,
since
θH
is
ΓK
-equivariant,
if
we
tensor
θH
over
Qp
with
Cp
(1)
and
take
ΓK
-invariants,
we
obtain
from
θ
(in
a
natural
way)
a
K-linear
injection
θD
:
DY
→
DX
and
hence
a
rational
map
from
PX
to
PY
.
Thus,
in
some
sense,
without
doing
anything
terribly
new
(i.e.,
we
have
only
just
applied
results
known
to
Tate
since
the
1960’s),
we
have
already
come
relatively
close
to
constructing
a
morphism
from
XK
to
YK
.
Indeed,
what
we
have
done
is
to
construct
a
morphism
θD
from
diﬀerentials
on
YK
to
diﬀerentials
on
XK
,
which
we
would
like
to
hope
arises
as
the
pull-back
map
on
diﬀerentials
associated
to
a
morphism
from
XK
to
YK
.
Moreover,
since
XK
(respectively,
YK
)
is
canonically
embedded
in
PX
(respectively,
PY
),
it
follows
from
elementary
algebraic
geometry
that
the
“only”
thing
we
need
to
show
is
⊗i
i
def
that
θD
preserves
relations:
That
is,
if
i
is
a
positive
integer,
let
DX
=
H
0
(XK
,
ωX
).
K
/K
i
Similarly,
we
have
DY
.
Note
that
multiplication
of
diﬀerential
forms
deﬁnes
a
natural
morphism
i

DY
→
DYi
Let
us
denote
the
kernel
of
this
morphism
by
Ri
.
Thus,
Ri
is
the
set
of
relations
(of
degree
i)
deﬁning
YK
as
a
subvariety
of
PY
.
Moreover,
by
composing
the
ith
tensor
power
of
θD
i
with
the
natural
morphism
from
the
ith
tensor
power
of
DX
to
DX
,
we
obtain
a
morphism
i
κ
:
i

i
DY
→
DX
Then
we
shall
say
that
θ
:
ΠXK
→
ΠYK
preserves
relations
if
κi
(Ri
)
=
0
for
all
positive
integers
i.
As
stated
earlier,
once
we
know
that
θ
preserves
relations,
it
follows
from
elementary
algebraic
geometry
(see
[Harts],
Chapter
II)
that
the
rational
map
from
PX
to
PY
deﬁned
by
θD
induces
a
(dominant)
morphism
XK
→
YK
,
as
desired.
(Once
one
has
this
morphism
XK
→
YK
,
the
fact
that
the
map
that
it
induces
on
fundamental
groups
coincides
with
θ
is
a
matter
of
general
nonsense
–
for
details,
we
refer
to
the
argument
preceding
Theorem
14.1.)
Thus,
to
review
what
we
have
done
so
far,
we
have
reduced
the
main
problem
to
showing
that
any
θ
:
ΠXK
→
ΠYK
as
in
(∗)prop
preserves
relations.
It
should
be
emphasized
at
this
point,
that
so
far
everything
that
we
have
done
has
been
painless
general
nonsense
–
the
substantive
mathematical
core
of
the
argument
is
yet
to
come
(after
some
more
general
nonsense
in
the
next
few
paragraphs).
The
next
step
is
to
introduce
a
ﬁeld
L,
9
as
follows:
Let
us
assume
for
simplicity
that
XK
extends
to
a
stable
curve
X
over
OK
.
Let
p
∈
X
be
an
irreducible
component
of
the
special
ﬁber
of
X
.
Then
the
completion
of
the
local
ring
OX
,p
is
a
p-adically
complete
discrete
valuation
ring
OL
,
whose
quotient
ﬁeld
we
denote
by
L.
The
space
ΩL
of
p-adically
continuous
diﬀerentials
of
L
over
K
is
then
a
one-dimensional
L-vector
space.
Thus,
L
is,
in
some
sense,
one-dimensional
over
K.
Alternatively,
one
may
think
of
Spec(L)
roughly
as
some
sort
of
small
p-adic
open
set
in
XK
.
At
any
rate,
from
the
construction
of
L,
it
follows
that
we
have
a
natural
L-valued
point
ξX
:
Spec(L)
→
XK
.
Since
L
is
“one-dimensional,”
it
is
easy
to
check
that
the
restriction
map
on
diﬀerentials
i
DX
→
Ω⊗i
L
(where
“Ω⊗i
L
”
denotes
the
tensor
product
of
i
copies
of
ΩL
over
L)
is
injective.
Thus,
instead
of
checking
that
κi
(Ri
)
=
0,
it
suﬃces
to
check
that
the
composite
κiL
:
i

DY
→
Ω⊗i
L
of
κi
with
the
above
restriction
map
vanishes
on
Ri
.
In
other
words,
we
would
like
to
compute
κiL
.
To
“compute”
κiL
,
we
need
to
go
back
to
looking
at
fundamental
groups.
First
of
all,
let
us
observe
that
by
functoriality
of
the
fundamental
group,
the
natural
L-valued
point
ξX
:
Spec(L)
→
XK
deﬁnes
a
morphism
αL
X
:
ΓL
→
ΠXK
whose
composite
with
the
augmentation
ΠXK
→
ΓK
is
the
morphism
ΓL
→
ΓK
on
Galois
groups
induced
by
the
inclusion
of
ﬁelds
K
⊆
L.
Moreover,
if
we
compose
αL
X
with
θ,
we
obtain
a
morphism
αL
Y
:
ΓL
→
ΠYK
Now
let
us
suppose
that
we
know
that
αL
Y
is
geometric,
i.e.,
that
it
arises
from
some
Lvalued
point
ξY
:
Spec(L)
→
YK
of
YK
.
Then
it
follows
immediately
from
the
theory
of
[Falt1]
that
κiL
may
be
computed
as
the
restriction
map
on
diﬀerentials
associated
to
ξY
.
But
it
is
clear
that
this
restriction
map
on
diﬀerentials
annihilates
Ri
.
Thus,
to
summarize:
in
order
to
show
that
θ
preserves
relations,
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
αL
Y
is
geometric.
As
remarked
earlier,
the
above
prefatory
remarks
are
just
“general
nonsense.”
The
mathematical
core
of
the
present
paper
lies
in
showing
that
given
a
geometric
αL
X
,
together
prop
L
,
the
resulting
αY
is
again
geometric.
The
proof
that
with
a
θ
:
ΠXK
→
ΠYK
as
in
(∗)
L
αY
is
geometric
is
long
and
intricate,
and
can
be
divided
roughly
into
four
parts:
10
(1)
First,
we
consider
a
K-valued
point
x
∈
XK
(K)
of
XK
,
and
its
associated
map
on
fundamental
groups
αK
X
:
ΓK
→
ΠXK
.
It
is
elementary
to
show
that
the
process
of
passing
from
the
point
x
∈
XK
(K)
to
the
arithmetic
ﬁrst
Chern
class
of
its
associated
line
bundle
def
K
2
=
c1
(OXK
(x))
∈
Het
(XK
,
Zp
(1))
=
H
2
(ΠXK
,
Zp
(1))
ηX
can
be
carried
out
just
by
working
with
αK
X
(see
the
ﬁrst
half
of
Section
7
K
for
details
on
this
“group-theoretic
recipe”
for
concocting
ηX
out
of
αK
X
).
K
K
On
the
other
hand,
by
composing
αX
with
θ,
we
get
an
αY
:
ΓK
→
ΠYK
.
The
ﬁrst
step
then
is
to
show
that:
If
one
carries
out
this
recipe
for
αK
Y
(which
may
or
may
not
arise
geometrically)
so
as
to
obtain
a
class
ηYK
∈
H
2
(ΠYK
,
Zp
(1)),
then
ηYK
is
the
arithmetic
ﬁrst
Chern
class
of
a
line
bundle
(necessarily
of
degree
prime
to
p)
on
YK
.
This
is
the
topic
of
Sections
1
through
5.

Next,
we
go
back
to
L-valued
points,
and
their
associated
αL
X
,
αY
.
L
Then,
just
as
in
the
case
of
K-valued
points,
one
can
form
ηY
,
and
one
would
like
to
know
that
ηYL
is
the
arithmetic
ﬁrst
Chern
class
of
def
a
line
bundle
(necessarily
of
degree
prime
to
p)
on
YL
=
YK
⊗K
L.
This
is
technically
much
more
intricate
than
the
K-valued
case,
and
is
done
(roughly
speaking)
by
thinking
about
the
“diﬀerence”
between
the
Chern
class
of
a
K-valued
point
and
of
an
L-valued
point,
and
showing
that
this
diﬀerence
has
special
properties
that
are
preserved
by
θ.
This
allows
one
to
derive
the
assertion
in
the
L-valued
case
from
the
corresponding
assertion
in
the
K-valued
case,
which
was
already
handled
in
(1)
above.
This
reduction
is
the
topic
of
Sections
6
and
7.
(3)
Recall
that
we
would
like
to
show
that
αL
Y
is
geometric.
We
know
from
(2)
above
that
at
least
there
exists
a
line
bundle
on
YL
of
degree
prime
to
p.
Then
an
elementary
algebraic
geometry
argument
shows
that
this
implies
the
existence
of
a
rational
point
of
YL
deﬁned
over
a
tamely
ramiﬁed
(this
will
be
crucial
in
Step
(4)!)
extension
L
of
L.
Although
this
portion
of
the
proof
is
technically
rather
trivial,
its
discovery
was
a
key
step
in
the
creation
of
the
proof
of
Theorem
A.
This
portion
of
the
proof
is
discussed
in
Section
8.
(4)
Finally,
by
applying
(3)
to
all
the
curves
in
a
certain
tower
of
coverings
of
the
original
YL
,
we
obtain
a
collection
of
rational
points
of
the
curves
of
this
tower
that
are
deﬁned
over
tamely
ramiﬁed
extensions
of
L.
Then
by
using
Faltings’
p-adic
Hodge
theory
([Falt1]),
we
show
that
these
rational
points
necessarily
converge
p-adically
to
a
single
L-valued
point
of
YL
=
YK
⊗K
L
whose
associated
ΓL
→
ΠYK
is
necessarily
equal
to
11
L
αL
Y
.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
geometricity
of
αY
.
This
portion
of
the
proof
is
given
in
Sections
9
and
10
(and
applied
in
Section
13).
As
discussed
above,
once
one
knows
the
geometricity
of
αL
Y
,
one
can
conclude
the
preservation
of
relations
–
this
is
discussed
in
Sections
11
through
13.
Finally,
the
proof
of
(∗)iner
(i.e.,
the
diﬀerence
between
(∗)tech
and
(∗)prop
)
is
given
in
Section
14.
Unfortunately,
in
order
to
show
(∗)iner
,
it
is
necessary
to
go
through
all
the
steps
discussed
so
far
for
a
given
θ
:
ΠUK
→
ΠYK
,
and
then
to
conclude
(∗)iner
from
the
preservation
of
relations.
This
makes
the
proof
much
more
technically
intricate
than
it
would
be
if
one
could
prove
(∗)iner
from
some
sort
of
a
priori
argument,
and
then
prove
preservation
of
relations
only
for
θ
:
ΠXK
→
ΠYK
as
in
(∗)prop
.
We
would
like
to
close
this
outline
of
the
proof
of
Theorem
A
by
discussing
Step
(1)
above
(i.e.,
the
content
of
Sections
1
through
5)
in
greater
detail.
The
reason
for
this
is
that
Step
(1)
is
what
allowed
us
to
generalize
the
“isomorphisms
only”
result
of
[Mzk2]
to
the
homomorphism
result
of
the
present
paper.
First
of
all,
let
us
recall
the
notion
of
the
Malčev
completion
(cf.,
e.g.,
[Del],
§9)
of
ΔX
.
In
fact,
we
shall
only
need
the
“smallest
nontrivial
part
of
Malčev
completion”:
concretely,
a
unipotent
algebraic
group
over
Qp
,
which
we
denote
by
MX
,
whose
representations
are
the
same
as
continuous
representations
of
ΔX
/[ΔX
,
[ΔX
,
ΔX
]]
on
some
Qp
-vector
space
V
which
is
equipped
with
a
ΔX
-invariant
ﬁltration
on
whose
subquotients
ΔX
acts
trivially.
In
fact,
since
unipotent
algebraic
groups
are
equivalent
to
their
Lie
algebras,
we
shall
consider
instead
the
Lie
algebra
MX
of
MX
.
Next,
observe
that
any
section
αK
X
:
ΓK
→
ΠXK
deﬁnes
(by
conjugation)
a
true
action
(i.e.,
not
just
an
action
up
to
inner
automorphisms)
of
ΓK
on
ΔX
,
hence
on
MX
.
Relative
to
this
action,
their
exists
a
unique
“weight
zero
quotient”
MX
⊗Qp
Cp
→
ZX
.
Here,
we
call
the
quotient
“weight
zero”
because
it
is
the
maximal
quotient
MX
⊗Qp
Cp
→
Q
for
which
the
action
of
ΓK
on
Q
is
such
that
Q
has
a
ﬁltration
by
ΓK
-submodules
whose
subquotients
are
ΓK
-equivariantly
isomorphic
to
Cp
.
Moreover,
this
quotient
MX
⊗Qp
Cp
→
ZX
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
section
αK
X.
Step
(1)
is
based
on
the
following
pair
of
observations:
(i)
On
the
one
hand,
if
αK
X
arises
geometrically,
then
ZX
is
“HodgeTate.”
(By
abuse
of
terminology,
we
use
the
term
“Hodge-Tate”
here
to
mean
that
ZX
has
a
Cp
-basis
of
ΓK
-invariant
elements.)
This
is
the
content
of
Proposition
3.5.
K
is
the
(ii)
On
the
other
hand,
if
ZX
is
“Hodge-Tate,”
then
the
class
ηX
ﬁrst
Chern
class
of
a
line
bundle.
This
is
essentially
the
content
of
the
calculation
performed
in
Proposition
4.4
(see
also
Lemma
7.3).
Moreover,
if
one
starts
with
a
surjective
θ
:
ΠXK
→
ΠYK
,
then
ZX
maps
naturally
to,
and
in
fact,
surjects
onto
ZY
.
Thus,
if
one
starts
with
an
αK
X
that
arises
geometrically,
then
one
knows
from
Observation
(i)
above
that
ZX
is
Hodge-Tate,
but
any
quotient
of
a
Hodge-Tate
representation
of
ΓK
–
i.e.,
such
as
ZY
–
is
always
Hodge-Tate,
so
Observation
(ii)
above
thus
allows
one
to
complete
Step
(1).
12
At
this
point,
the
reader
may
wonder
how
the
author
stumbled
upon
the
two
key
observations
of
the
preceding
paragraph.
In
fact,
the
author
ﬁrst
realized
what
was
going
on
by
considering
the
ordinary
case
(see
Section
1
for
a
detailed
discussion).
In
this
case,
the
“weight
zero
quotient”
exists
at
the
level
of
groups,
without
passing
to
Malčev
completions
or
tensoring
with
Cp
:
namely,
(in
the
notation
of
Section
1)
it
is
the
quotient
et
ΔX
→
Δet
X
(which
thus
gives
rise
to
a
quotient
ΠXK
→
ΠXK
).
Moreover,
as
is
shown
in
Section
1,
it
is
elementary
to
show
that
ΔX
→
Δet
X
can
be
recovered
group-theoretically,
and
that
every
section
ΓK
→
ΠXK
that
arises
geometrically
(from
a
point
of
XK
)
induces
et
a
ﬁxed,
group-theoretically
constructible
section
θX
:
ΓK
→
Πet
XK
of
ΠXK
→
ΓK
.
These
observations
are
enough
to
complete
Step
(1)
(in
the
ordinary
case).
Thus,
one
may
regard
the
discussion
in
the
preceding
paragraphs
(which
is
valid
in
the
nonordinary
case)
as
simply
the
result
of
generalizing
the
observations
discussed
in
this
paragraph
in
the
ordinary
case
to
the
possibly
nonordinary
case
by
means
of
the
technical
machinery
of
the
Malčev
completion
and
p-adic
Hodge
theory.
Finally,
let
us
make
the
following
observation:
As
one
can
see
from
the
key
argument
discussed
above,
in
fact,
really,
one
does
not
need
all
of
ΔX
.
That
is
to
say,
in
the
above
argument
(concerning
the
issue
of
when
ZX
is
Hodge-Tate),
one
actually
only
uses
the
quotient
ΔX
/[ΔX
,
[ΔX
,
ΔX
]].
It
is
this
observation
that
is
behind
the
truncated
generalizations
(Theorems
A
and
A
)
of
Theorem
A.

Section
0:
Preliminaries
and
Notations
Let
p
be
a
prime
number.
Throughout
this
paper
the
symbol
“∧”
over
or
to
the
upperright
of
an
object
will
denote
the
p-adic
completion
of
that
object.
Let
K
be
a
Qp
-algebra.
Let
Ω
be
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld.
Then
given
a
base-point
b
∈
HomRing
(K,
Ω),
we
can
form
the
algebraic
fundamental
group
π1
(Spec(K),
b)
Typically,
the
choice
of
base-point
b
will
not
be
important
for
us,
so
we
shall
write
ΓK
for
π1
(Spec(K),
b).
Suppose
that
Spec(K)
is
a
“universal
covering
space”
for
Spec(K)
such
13
that
b
arises
from
a
ring
homomorphism
K
→
Ω.
Then
we
may
think
of
ΓK
as
Gal(K/K).
We
shall
denote
the
étale
cohomology
of
Spec(K)
by
H
i
(K,
−).
If
M
is
a
proﬁnite
abelian
group
with
a
continuous
ΓK
-action,
then
M
naturally
deﬁnes
an
inverse
system
{Fα
}
of
locally
constant
sheaves
on
the
étale
site
of
Spec(K),
and
we
shall
write
H
i
(K,
M)
for
the
inverse
limit
(over
α)
of
the
H
i
(K,
Fα
).
Note
that
for
each
r
∈
Z,
Zp
(r)
(where
the
“(r)”
is
a
Tate
twist)
has
a
natural
structure
of
ΓK
-module.
Deﬁnition
0.1.
We
shall
call
K
a
p-adic
ﬁeld
if
it
is
the
quotient
ﬁeld
of
a
p-adically
complete,
mixed
characteristic
discrete
valuation
ring
OK
.
We
shall
denote
the
residue
ﬁeld
(respectively,
maximal
ideal)
of
OK
by
k
(respectively,
mK
).
We
shall
call
K
a
p-adic
local
ﬁeld
if
k
is
a
ﬁnite
ﬁeld.
def
If
K
is
a
p-adic
ﬁeld,
and
K
is
an
algebraic
closure
of
K,
then
K
→
Ω
=
K
determines
a
base-point
“b,”
and
we
have
ΓK
=
Gal(K/K).
In
this
case,
H
i
(K,
−)
is
equal
to
the
continuous
group
cohomology
of
the
proﬁnite
group
ΓK
.
If
K
is
a
p-adic
local
ﬁeld,
then
K
is,
in
fact,
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
.
Now
(without
any
assumptions
on
the
Qp
-algebra
K),
let
us
assume
that
we
are
given
a
hyperbolic
curve
XK
→
Spec(K)
over
K
of
type
(g,
r).
(By
“curve,”
we
shall
always
mean
a
smooth,
one-dimensional,
geometrically
connected
scheme
over
the
base.
By
“type
(g,
r),”
we
mean
that
XK
⊗K
K
is
obtained
by
removing
r
mutually
nonintersecting
Kvalued
points
from
a
proper
curve
over
K
of
genus
g.
By
“hyperbolic,”
we
mean
that
2g
−
2
+
r
≥
1.)
When
XK
is
proper,
we
shall
denote
its
Jacobian
(an
abelian
scheme
over
K)
by
JX
(or
JXK
when
several
bases
are
in
use
and
it
is
necessary
to
specify
the
base
in
question).
Let
us
assume
that
XK
is
equipped
with
a
base-point
x
∈
XK
(Ω)
(which
is
compatible
def
def
with
the
base-point
b
of
Spec(K)).
Then
we
can
form
Πprf
=
π1
(XK
,
x)
and
Δprf
X
X
=
π1
(XK
,
x).
(The
use
of
“Δ”
to
denote
the
geometric
fundamental
group
may
be
new
to
some
readers.
Here,
we
use
“Δ”
partly
because
“Π”
is
already
used
for
the
arithmetic
fundamental
group
and
partly
to
conform
to
the
notations
of
[Falt1],
a
reference
on
which
the
present
paper
depends
heavily.)
Occasionally,
to
avoid
confusion,
we
shall
also
use
the
prf
prf
notation
Δprf
XK
for
ΔX
.
Let
ΔX
be
the
maximal
pro-p
quotient
of
ΔX
.
Since
the
kernel
prf
prf
of
Δprf
X
→
ΔX
is
normal
in
ΠXK
,
we
may
form
the
quotient
of
ΠXK
by
this
kernel,
and
call
the
resulting
quotient
group
ΠXK
.
Thus,
we
have
an
exact
sequence
1
→
ΔX
→
ΠXK
→
ΓK
→
1
Moreover,
this
exact
sequence
induces
a
representation
14
def
ρX
:
ΓK
→
Out(ΔX
)
=
Aut(ΔX
)/Inn(ΔX
)
into
the
outer
automorphism
group
of
ΔX
.
(Here,
“Aut(ΔX
)”
(respectively,
“Inn(ΔX
)”)
denotes
the
group
of
continuous
automorphisms
(respectively,
inner
automorphisms)
of
ΔX
.)
Conversely,
it
is
well-known
(see,
e.g.,
[Tama],
§7,
A.)
that
the
above
exact
sequence
can
be
recovered
from
ρX
.
Next,
we
would
like
to
introduce
some
terminology
particular
to
pro-p
groups.
Let
Δ
be
a
pro-p
group
(i.e.,
a
topological
group
obtained
by
taking
an
inverse
limit
of
ﬁnite
groups
of
p-power
order).
Let
Δ
⊆
Δ
be
the
unique
normal
subgroup
of
Δ
with
the
following
property:
Δ
→
Δ/Δ
is
the
maximal
(topologically)
Hausdorﬀ
abelian
quotient
of
Δ
which
def
def
is
annihilated
by
p.
For
i
≥
0,
let
Δ<0>
=
Δ;
Δ<i+1>
=
(Δ<i>
)
.
Thus,
we
obtain
a
descending
series
of
closed
normal
(even
characteristic!)
subgroups
.
.
.
⊆
Δ<i>
⊆
.
.
.
⊆
Δ.
Note
that
since
Δ,
being
a
pro-p
group,
is
“pro-solvable,”
it
follows
that
the
intersection
of
all
the
Δ<i>
is
{1}.
Moreover,
if
Δ
is
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated,
it
follows
that
the
Δ/Δ<i>
are
all
ﬁnite
groups.
Deﬁnition
0.2.
We
shall
refer
to
any
one
of
the
Δ<i>
as
a
p-derivate
of
Δ.
Thus,
in
particular,
if
Δ
=
ΔX
,
then
it
follows
(by
the
structure
of
the
fundamental
group
of
an
algebraic
curve
in
characteristic
zero)
that
Δ
is
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated,
so
the
Δ/Δ<i>
are
all
ﬁnite
groups.
Next,
let
us
consider
the
Kummer
sequence
on
XK
,
i.e.,
the
exact
sequence
of
étale
sheaves
on
XK
given
by
0
→
Z/pn
Z(1)
→
Gm
→
Gm
→
0
(for
n
≥
1).
(Here,
the
“(1)”
is
a
“Tate
twist,”
and
the
morphism
from
Gm
to
Gm
is
given
by
raising
to
the
(pn
)th
power.)
The
connecting
morphism
induced
on
étale
cohomology
by
the
Kummer
sequence
then
gives
us
a
morphism
H
1
(XK
,
Gm
)
→
H
2
(XK
,
(Z/pn
Z)(1)).
Now
suppose
that
L
is
a
line
bundle
on
XK
.
Applying
the
connecting
morphism
just
considered
to
L
(which
deﬁnes
an
element
of
H
1
(XK
,
Gm
)),
we
obtain
a
compatible
system
of
classes
in
H
2
(XK
,
(Z/pn
Z)(1))
(for
each
n
≥
1),
hence
a
class
c1
(L)
∈
H
2
(XK
,
Zp
(1)).
Deﬁnition
0.3.
We
shall
refer
to
c1
(L)
as
the
arithmetic
ﬁrst
Chern
class
of
L.
Finally,
we
have
the
following
elementary
technical
result,
which
states
that
the
étale
cohomology
of
a
hyperbolic
curve
may
be
computed
as
the
group
cohomology
of
its
fundamental
group:
Lemma
0.4.
Assume
that
K
is
a
ﬁeld.
For
all
integers
i,
r,
the
natural
morphisms
H
i
(ΔX
,
Zp
(r))
→
H
i
(XK
,
Zp
(r));
H

(ΔXK

XK
,
Zp

→
H

and
H
i
(ΠXK

Zp

→
H

H
i
(ΠXK
×K
XK
,
Zp
(r))
→
H
i
(XK
×K
XK
,
Zp
(r))
are
isomorphisms.
Proof.
By
the
Leray-Serre
spectral
sequence,
it
suﬃces
to
prove
that
the
morphisms
of
the
ﬁrst
line
are
isomorphisms.
Let
Z
be
XK
or
XK
×K
XK
.
Then
it
follows
by
general
nonsense
that
it
suﬃces
to
check
that
for
any
ﬁnite
étale
Galois
covering
Y
→
Z
of
p-power
order,
and
any
cohomology
class
η
∈
H
i
(Y,
Fp
)
(where
i
>
0),
there
exists
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
Y

→
Y
of
p-power
order
such
that
η|Y

=
0.
By
the
Künneth
formula,
it
suﬃces
to
do
the
case
Z
=
XK
.
Then
what
we
must
check
is
trivial
for
i
>
2
(since
then
η
=
0
to
begin
with),
and
clear
for
i
=
1
(by
the
relationship
between
étale
coverings
and
H
1
).
If
i
=
2,
then
it
suﬃces
to
take
Y

→
Y
such
that
Y

→
Y
has
degree
p
over
every
connected
component
of
Y
.
This
completes
the
proof.
Section
1:
The
Ordinary
Case
Let
p
be
a
prime
number.
Let
K
be
a
p-adic
ﬁeld
with
algebraically
closed
residue
ﬁeld.
Then,
as
discussed
in
Section
0,
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
K
will
be
denoted
ΓK
.
Let
XK
→
Spec(K)
be
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
K
of
type
(g,
r).
In
this
Section,
let
us
also
assume
that
XK
admits
a
stable
extension
X
→
Spec(OK
)
over
OK
.
By
this,
we
mean
that
there
exists
a
(necessarily
unique)
r-pointed
stable
(in
particular,
proper)
curve
X
→
Spec(OK
)
of
genus
g
such
that
X
is
the
complement
in
X
of
the
images
of
the
r
marking
sections
of
X.
Let
us
write
Xk
(respectively,
X
k
)
for
X
⊗OK
k
(respectively,
X
⊗OK
k).
Remark.
Recall
that
an
r-pointed
stable
curve
of
genus
g
(where
2g
−
2
+
r
≥
1)
is
a
proper,
ﬂat
morphism
f
:
C
→
S,
together
with
r
mutually
disjoint
sections
σ1
,
.
.
.
,
σr
:
S
→
C,
such
that
(1)
The
geometric
ﬁbers
of
f
are
connected,
reduced,
of
arithmetic
genus
g,
and
have
at
most
nodes
as
singularities.
(2)
The
sheaf
ωC/S
(σ1
+
.
.
.
+
σr
)
(i.e.,
the
sheaf
of
sections
of
the
dualizing
bundle
of
C
over
S
with
poles
of
order
≤
1
at
the
divisors
deﬁned
by
the
images
of
the
sections
σ1
,
.
.

,
σr
)
is
relatively
ample
over
S.
We
refer
to
[DM],
[Knud]
for
more
details.

Now
we
make
the
following
Deﬁnition
1.1.
We
shall
call
XK
ordinary
if
the
Jacobian
of
every
connected
component
of
the
normalization
of
the
curve
X
k
is
an
ordinary
abelian
variety.
In
this
Section,
we
would
like
to
assume
that
XK
is
ordinary.
Under
this
assumption,
it
is
well-known
that
π1
(X
k
)(p)
(where
the
“(p)”
denotes
the
maximal
pro-p
quotient)
is
a
free
2
pro-p
group
of
rank
g.
(Indeed,
this
follows
from
the
fact
that
Het
(X
k
,
Fp
)
=
0
(which
may
be
shown
by
using
the
long
exact
sequence
in
étale
cohomology
obtained
by
considering
Fp
as
the
kernel
of
“1−
Frobenius”
acting
on
OX
k
),
plus
Proposition
2.3
of
Chapter
III,
§3,
of
[Sha].)
Moreover,
since
étale
coverings
of
X
k
lift
uniquely
to
characteristic
zero,
it
follows
that
we
have
a
continuous
surjection:
(p)
X
:
ΠXK
→
π1
(X
k
)
If
we
restrict
X
to
ΔX
,
we
obtain
a
surjection
ΔX
→
π1
(X
k
)(p)
.
In
the
following,
we
shall
regard
π1
(X
k
)(p)
as
a
quotient
of
ΔX
via
this
surjection.
Let
us
denote
this
quotient
et
by
Δet
X
.
Note
that
the
kernel
of
the
surjection
ΔX
→
ΔX
is
normal
as
a
subgroup
of
ΠXK
.
Thus,
by
taking
the
quotient
of
ΠXK
by
this
kernel,
we
obtain
a
quotient
ΠXK
→
Πet
XK
.
In
other
words,
we
have
an
exact
sequence
et
1
→
Δet
X
→
ΠXK
→
ΓK
→
1
together
with
a
surjection
et
ζX
:
Πet
XK
→
Δ
X
which
is
the
identity
on
Δet
X.
Now
observe
that
the
kernel
of
ζX
projects
isomorphically
to
ΓK
.
Thus,
we
obtain
a
section
θX
:
ΓK
→
Πet
XK
Next,
let
us
observe
that
every
element
of
Im(θX
)
commutes
with
every
element
of
Δet
X.
Indeed,
this
follows
from
the
fact
that
such
commutation
relations
hold
after
projection
et
by
Πet
XK
→
ΓK
,
plus
the
fact
that
Im(θX
)
=
Ker(ζX
)
is
normal
in
ΠXK
(and
maps
isomorphically
to
ΓK
via
the
projection
Πet
XK
→
ΓK
).
On
the
other
hand,
since,
as
is
well-known
(see,
e.g.,
[Tama],
§1,
Propositions
1.1,
1.11),
pro-p
free
groups
(of
rank
≥
2)
have
trivial
centers,
it
thus
follows
that
we
obtain
the
following
“group-theoretic”
characterization
of
θX
(when
g
≥
2):
17
et
Lemma
1.2.
Suppose
that
g
≥
2.
Then
the
section
θX
:
ΓK
→
Πet
XK
of
ΠXK
→
ΓK
is
et
the
unique
section
whose
image
commutes
with
every
element
of
Δet
X
⊆
ΠXK
.
On
the
other
hand,
the
quotient
ΔX
→
Δet
X
(and
hence
also
the
quotient
ΠXK
→
et
ΠXK
)
can
also
be
reconstructed
group-theoretically
by
means
of
the
following
condition
on
an
open
normal
subgroup
H
⊆
ΔX
:
(∗)et
Let
N
⊆
ΔX
be
any
subgroup
such
that
H
⊆
N
and
N/H
is
cyclic.
def
Then
there
exists
a
surjection
N
ab
=
N/[N,
N
]
→
Q,
where
Q
is
a
free
Zp
-module
of
rank
one,
with
the
following
properties:
(i)
there
exists
an
open
subgroup
Γ
⊆
ΓK
that
stabilizes
N
and
N
ab
→
Q
and
acts
trivially
on
Q;
(ii)
the
surjection
N
→
N/H
factors
through
Q.
Then
we
have
the
following
“group-theoretic”
characterization
of
the
quotient
ΔX
→
Δet
X:
Lemma
1.3.
The
kernel
of
ΔX
→
Δet
X
is
the
intersection
of
all
open
normal
subgroups
H
⊆
ΔX
such
that
H
satisﬁes
the
condition
(∗)et
.
Proof.
The
proof
is
entirely
the
same
as
that
of
Sections
3
and
8
of
[Mzk1].
The
basic
idea
is
that
if
the
covering
corresponding
to
ΔX
/H
is
not
étale
(over
OK
),
then
it
has
nontrivial
inertia
subgroups.
Such
inertia
subgroups
have
nontrivial
cyclic
subgroups.
If
we
then
apply
(∗)et
to
the
case
where
N/H
is
one
of
these
nontrivial
cyclic
subgroups,
then
we
have
a
contradiction,
since
the
quotient
N
→
N/H
factors
through
the
quotient
N
→
Q;
moreover,
the
quotient
N
→
Q
necessarily
corresponds
to
a
covering
which
is
étale
over
OK
because
of
the
assumption
concerning
the
action
of
Γ
⊆
ΓK
on
Q.
Let
us
review
what
we
have
done
so
far.
So
far,
we
have:
et
(1)
constructed
quotients
ΠXK
→
Πet
XK
and
ΔX
→
ΔX
,
as
well
as
a
section
ΓK
→
Πet
XK
via
various
geometric
considerations
concerning
XK
;
(2)
shown
(when
g
≥
2)
that
the
above
quotients
and
section
may
be
reconstructed
entirely
“group-theoretically.”
Here,
we
pause
to
make
the
following
Remark
Concerning
the
Term
“Group-Theoretic.”
In
[Mzk1]
and
[Mzk2],
we
imparted
mathematical
rigor
to
the
term
“group-theoretic”
(cf.
the
remark
on
this
issue
in
Section
14
of
[Mzk2])
by
specifying
that
it
meant
“preserved
by
isomorphism.”
In
the
present
paper,
however,
we
would
like
to
consider
homomorphisms
which
are
not
necessarily
isomorphisms.
Thus,
in
the
present
paper,
when
we
wish
to
state
that
a
certain
property
or
object
is
preserved
by
such
homomorphisms,
we
shall
state
this
explicitly
without
using
18
the
term
“group-theoretic.”
In
the
above
discussion,
however,
we
recommend
the
reader
to
simply
accept
this
term
at
the
level
of
“common
sense,”
since
we
will
not
use
the
“grouptheoreticity”
stated
in
any
of
the
results
of
this
Section
in
the
proof
of
any
of
the
main
theorems
of
this
paper.
Finally,
before
continuing,
we
make
the
following
important
observation:
Let
αx
:
ΓK
→
ΠXK
denote
the
section
of
ΠXK
→
ΓK
determined
(up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
induced
by
an
element
of
ΔX
)
by
a
point
x
∈
XK
(K).
Denote
by
et
et
αet
x
:
ΓK
→
ΠXK
the
composite
of
αx
with
ΠXK
→
ΠXK
.
Lemma
1.4.
We
have
αet
x
=
θX
.
et
Proof.
It
suﬃces
to
show
that
the
composite
of
αet
x
with
the
surjection
ζX
:
ΠXK
→
Δet
X
is
trivial.
Interpreted
geometrically,
this
simply
means
that
“the
pull-back
of
any
étale
covering
Y
→
X
(i.e.,
étale
over
OK
)
to
Spec(K)
via
x
is
the
trivial
étale
covering
of
Spec(K).”
But
this
assertion
follows
immediately
from
the
fact
that
OK
is
strictly
henselian.
Section
2:
Review
of
Galois
Cohomology
Let
K
be
a
p-adic
ﬁeld
whose
residue
ﬁeld
is
perfect.
Let
S
→
Spec(OK
)
be
a
geometrically
connected
smooth
morphism,
and
let
D
⊆
S
be
a
relative
(over
OK
)
divisor
with
normal
crossings.
Let
us
write
S
log
for
the
log
scheme
obtained
by
equipping
S
with
the
log
structure
deﬁned
by
D
(as
in
[Kato]).
Let
us
also
assume
that
S
is
small
(in
the
sense
of
[Falt1],
[Falt2]):
Recall
that
this
simply
means
that
S
is
aﬃne,
say,
equal
to
Spec(R),
and,
moreover,
étale
over
some
OK
[X1
,
.
.
.
,
Xd
]
in
such
a
way
that
D
is
schematically
the
inverse
image
of
the
zero
locus
of
the
function
X1
·
.
.
.
·
Xd
.
The
reason
we
wish
to
deal
with
small
(S,
D)
is
that
in
[Falt1],
certain
Galois
cohomology
groups
associated
to
such
(S,
D)
are
computed
explicitly
by
means
of
the
theory
of
almost
étale
extensions.
The
purpose
of
this
Section
is
to
review
certain
consequences
of
the
theory
of
[Falt1]
and
[Falt2]
that
are
of
relevance
to
us
in
this
paper.

Let

Thus,
we
have

gives
us
a
natural
exact
sequence:

Now
we
would
like
to
compute
some
Galois
cohomology
groups:
Lemma
2.1.
For
all
j

Z,
we
have:



H

(Here
the
“(j)”
is
a

twist.)
Proof.
This
follows
from
Theorem
4.4
of
Section
I
of
[Falt1].
Indeed,
(1)
follows
from
[Falt1],
Section

Theorem
4.4,

(applied
to
the

i
=

tensored

This
result
is
due
to
[Tate]
in
the
case
R
=
OK
.
(Indeed,
in
this
case,
(i)
and
(iii)
follow
from
[Tate],
§3.3,
Theorem
1;
while
(ii)
–
at
least
in
the
case
j
=
1
(the
proof
for
arbitrary
j
=
0
is
entirely
similar)
–
follows
from
[Tate],
§3.3,
Theorem
2.)
The
slightly
more
general
result
stated
here
(i.e.,
for
R
not
necessarily
equal
to
OK
)
follows
by
the
same
argument
as
that
employed
by
Tate
in
the
case
R
=
OK
(the
point
being
that
in
general,
R
is
OK
-ﬂat).
Alternatively,
the
cohomology
groups
in
the

can
also
be
computed
using

This

from

(applied

before
Lemma
2.1),
plus
the

two

Now
let
us
assume
that
we
are
given
an

f

:
X

of

where

pulling

back
the
universal

Then
taking

let

Proposition

There
is
a

Proof.
This
is
an
immediate
consequence
of
the
“Comparison
Theorem”
(Theorem
6.2
of
[Falt2]).
The
validity
of
the
proof
of
this
Theorem
given
in
[Falt2]
has
been
disputed
by
various
mathematicians.
However,
since
Proposition
2.4
is
a
relatively
weak
consequence
of
the
“Comparison
Theorem,”
it
already
follows
from
the
portion
of
[Falt2]
that
is
not
in
dispute.
(That
is
to
say,
we
need
only
that
M
is
“Hodge-Tate,”
not
that
it
is
“crystalline.”)
Alternatively,
although
the
sort
of
parametrized
(i.e.,
over
a
base
S)
Hodge-Tate
decomposition
that
we
need
here
is
not
stated
in
[Falt1],
it
follows
immediately
from
the
theory
of
[Falt1]
by
exactly
the
same
proof
as
that
of
the
main
result
of
[Falt1].
Yet
another
proof
of
this
sort
of
result
is
given
in
[Hyodo]
(the
ﬁnal
Theorem
–
i.e.,
the
“relative
version”
–
in
[Hyodo],
§0.3),
although
here
we
need
the
(relatively
straightforward)
logarithmic
generalization
of
[Hyodo]’s
result.
Section
3:
The
Weight
Zero
Quotient
In
this
Section,
we
maintain
the
notation
of
the
preceding
Section.
The
purpose
of
this
Section
is
to
give
a
(rather
weak)
nonabelian
analogue
of
Proposition
2.4.
In
fact,
a
much
stronger
“nonabelian
comparison
theorem”
for
the
fundamental
group
of
a
curve
can
be
proven,
but
since
I
do
not
know
of
any
place
where
such
a
result
has
been
written
up,
and,
moreover,
in
this
paper,
only
a
relatively
weak
nonabelian
comparison
theorem
is
needed,
I
decided
instead
to
give
a
rather
short
ad
hoc
treatment
of
this
issue
which
will,
nonetheless,
be
suﬃcient
for
the
purposes
of
this
paper.
21
log
Let
us
denote
the
fundamental
group
of
XK
by
Πprf
XK
.
Thus,
we
have
a
natural
prf
prf
surjection
ΠXK
→
ΓR
.
As
usual,
we
denote
the
kernel
of
this
surjection
by
Δprf
X
⊆
ΠXK
,
and
the
maximal
pro-p
quotient
of
Δprf
X
by
ΔX
.
Moreover,
by
forming
the
quotient
of
prf
prf
ΠXK
by
the
kernel
of
ΔX
→
ΔX
,
we
obtain
ΠXK
.
Thus,
just
as
in
Section
1,
we
have
an
exact
sequence
1
→
ΔX
→
ΠXK
→
ΓR
→
1
Moreover,
any
section
σ
:
S
→
X
of
X
→
S
whose
image
avoids
the
marked
points
and
nodes
deﬁnes
a
section
πσ
:
ΓR
→
ΠXK
of
the
above
exact
sequence.
Such
a
section
πσ
then
deﬁnes
an
action
of
ΓR
on
ΔX
by
conjugation.
Note
that
until
one
speciﬁes
the
section
ασ
:
ΓR
→
ΠXK
,
one
only
has
an
outer
action
of
ΓR
on
ΔX
(i.e.,
an
action
deﬁned
only
up
to
inner
automorphisms);
that
is
to
say,
in
general,
there
is
no
natural
action
(in
the
usual,
non-outer
sense)
of
ΓR
on
ΔX
until
one
speciﬁes
a
section
of
ΠXK
→
ΓR
.
The
next
step
is
to
introduce
the
Malčev
completion
of
ΔX
.
We
refer
to
[Del],
[NT]
for
more
details.
In
fact,
for
our
purposes,
it
will
be
suﬃcient
to
consider
a
truncated
form
of
the
Malčev
completion
of
ΔX
.
This
truncated
form
may
be
deﬁned
as
follows:
Let
C
be
the
category
of
ﬁnite
dimensional
Qp
-vector
spaces
V
equipped
with
a
continuous
ΔX
-action
that
factors
through
ΔX
/[ΔX
,
[ΔX
,
ΔX
]]
and
which
admits
a
ΔX
-invariant
ﬁltration
on
whose
subquotients
ΔX
acts
trivially.
(The
morphisms
of
this
category
are
the
Qp
[ΔX
]linear
morphisms
V
→
V

.)
Then
C
is
a
Tannakian
category
over
Qp
,
hence
gives
rise
to
an
algebraic
group
MX
over
Qp
.
Moreover,
this
algebraic
group
MX
is
unipotent,
hence
corresponds
to
a
nilpotent
Lie
algebra
MX
.
For
any
Qp
-algebra
A,
we
shall
write
(MX
)A
(respectively,
(MX
)A
)
for
MX
⊗Qp
A
(respectively,
MX
⊗Qp
A).
Let
us
write
MX
[1]
for
the
commutator
[MX
,
MX
]
of
this
Lie
algebra,
and
MX
[0]
for
def
the
quotient
MX
/MX
[1].
Then
MX
[0]
may
be
identiﬁed
with
HQp
=
H
⊗Zp
Qp
(where
H
is
as
in
the
discussion
following
Lemma
2.3
in
Section
2).
Thus,
we
get
an
exact
sequence
0
→
MX
[1]
→
MX
→
MX
[0]
=
HQp
→
0
Moreover,
the
commutator
[−,
−]
deﬁnes
a
surjection
cX
:
∧2
HQp
→
MX
[1]
Now
observe
that
although
there
is
no
natural
action
of
ΓR
on
MX
(unless
one
chooses
a
section
of
ΠXK
→
ΓR
),
there
is
nonetheless
a
natural
action
of
ΓR
on
MX
[0]
and
MX
[1]
with
respect
to
which
cX
is
equivariant.
Now
we
have
the
following
classical
result
Lemma
3.1.
The
kernel
of
cX
is
zero
if
r
>
0.
If
r
=
0,
then
the
kernel
of
cX
is
one∨
dimensional,
and
equal
to
the
image
of
the
dual
to
the
intersection
form
∧2
HQ
→
Qp
(−1)
p
(deﬁned
by
the
cup
product
pairing
on
the
cohomology
of
ΔX
).
22
Proof.
If
r
>
0,
then
ΔX
is
a
free
pro-p
group.
Thus,
in
this
case
the
result
follows
by
consideration
of
the
fact
that
a
representation
on
a
vector
space
V
of
the
free
group
on
n
generators
is
the
same
as
giving
n
endomorphisms
of
V
.
If
r
=
0,
then
ΔX
is
the
quotient
of
a
free
pro-p
group
by
a
single
relation;
it
is
this
relation
which
generates
the
kernel
of
cX
.
Moreover,
it
is
easy
to
see
from
the
well-known
explicit
form
of
this
relation
that
its
image
in
∧2
HQp
is
precisely
as
speciﬁed
in
the
statement
of
the
Lemma
(cf.
the
discussion
in
§2
of
[NT]).
Next,
we
would
like
to
construct
a
certain
special
quotient
ZX
of
(MX
)
.
By
the
RK
well-known
categorical
equivalence
between
unipotent
algebraic
groups
and
nilpotent
Lie
algebras
(cf.
[Del],
§9),
this
quotient
will
deﬁne
a
quotient
ZX
of
(MX
)
.
The
construcRK
tion
of
ZX
from
(MX
)
consists
of
two
steps.
The
ﬁrst
step
is
as
follows:
Consider
the
RK
surjection

→
∧2
H
⊗
R

∧2
H
⊗Zp
R
K
0
R
K
deﬁned
by
projecting
by
means
of
the
surjection
in
the
short
exact
sequence
of
Proposition
2.4.
It
follows
from
Lemmas
2.3
(ii)
(in
the
case
n
=
0)
and
3.1
that
this
surjection
factors
through
(MX
[1])
.
Thus,
we
obtain
a
surjection
RK
(MX
[1])
RK

→
∧2
H0
⊗R
R
K
By
pushing
forward
the
exact
sequence
0
→
MX
[1]
→
MX
→
MX
[0]
→
0
(tensored
over

)
via
this
surjection,
we
thus
obtain
a
Lie
algebra
U
(over
R

).
Thus,
we
Q
with
R
p
K
X
have
a
surjection
of
Lie
algebras
(MX
)
RK
K
→
UX
,
together
with
an
exact
sequence
0
→
UX
[1]
→
UX
→
UX
[0]
→
0
def

,
and
U
[0]
=
(M
[0])
.
where
UX
[1]
=
[UX
,
UX
]
=
∧2
H0
⊗R
R
K
X
X

RK
Now
we
come
to
the
second
step
in
the
construction
of
ZX
.
First
let
us
denote
by
def

the
surjection
deﬁned
by
the
surjection
in
the
short
exact
UX
[0]
→
UX
[0,
0]
=
H0
⊗R
R
K
sequence
of
Proposition
2.4.
Let
UX
[0,
1]
⊆
UX
[0]
be
the
kernel
of
this
surjection.
Let
BX
⊆
UX
denote
the
inverse
image
of
UX
[0,
1]
⊆
UX
[0]
under
the
surjection
UX
→
UX
[0].
Then
it
follows
from
the
deﬁnition
of
UX
that
BX
is
an
abelian
Lie
algebra
which,
in
fact,
lies
in
the
center
of
the
Lie
algebra
of
UX
.
(Indeed,
this
will
follow
as
soon
as
we
show
the
vanishing
of
[BX
,
UX
],
which
is
equal
to
the
image
of
UX
[0,
1]
∧
UX
[0]
⊆
∧2
HQp
under
the

;
composite
of
c
:
∧2
H
→
M
[1]
with
the
projection
M
[1]
→
U
[1]
=
∧2
H
⊗
R
X
Qp
X
X
X
0
R
K
but
this
image
is
zero,
by
the
deﬁnition
of
UX
[0,
1].)
This
observation
implies,
in
particular,
that
although,
a
priori,
we
have
only
an
outer
action
of
ΓR
on
UX
,
hence
on
BX
,
in
fact,
we
get
a
natural
(non-outer)
action
of
ΓR
on
BX
.
(That
is,
the
point
is
that
the
various
23
actions
of
ΓR
on
BX
arising
from
diﬀerent
sections
of
ΠXK
→
ΓR
diﬀer
only
by
an
automorphism
on
BX
induced
by
conjugation
by
some
element
of
ΔX
;
but
since
BX
lies
in
the
center
of
UX
,
it
follows
that
such
an
automorphism
of
BX
is
always
equal
to
the
identity.)
Next,
let
us
note
that
we
have
exact
sequences
0
→
BX
→
UX
→
UX
[0,
0]
→
0
and
0
→
UX
[1]
→
BX
→
UX
[0,
1]
→
0
where
the
latter
exact
sequence
is
an
exact
sequence
of
ΓR
-modules
(a
statement
which
has
meaning
as
a
result
of
the
observation
at
the
end
of
the
preceding
paragraph).
Now
observe

that
Lemma
2.3
(ii)
(for
n
=
0,
1
–
note
that
here
we
use
that
U
[1]
=
∧2
H
⊗
R
X
0
R
K

(1)
is
“of
weight
one”)
implies
that
the
is
“of
weight
zero,”
while
UX
[0,
1]
=
H1
⊗R
R
K
latter
exact
sequence
admits
a
unique
ΓR
-equivariant
splitting:
BX
→
UX
[1].
Moreover,
since
BX
is
(as
observed
above)
contained
in
the
center
of
the
Lie
algebra
UX
,
it
follows
that
the
kernel
of
this
splitting
BX
→
UX
[1]
forms
a
Lie
ideal
in
UX
.
Thus,
if
we
then
push
forward
the
former
exact
sequence
via
this
surjection
BX
→
UX
[1],
we
obtain
a
Lie
algebra
ZX
.
As
usual,
this
Lie
algebra
ﬁts
into
an
exact
sequence
0
→
ZX
[1]
→
ZX
→
ZX
[0]
→
0
Moreover,
one
has
natural
identiﬁcations:
ZX
[1]
=
∧2
ZX
[0]
(via
the
commutator
map);

(induced
by
the
surjection
of
the
short
exact
sequence
of
Propoand
Z
[0]
=
H
⊗
R
X
0
R
K

.
Finally,
as
noted
above,
Z
deﬁnes
sition
2.4).
In
particular,
ZX
[0]
is
of
rank
g
over
R
K
X
a
unipotent
algebraic
group
ZX
.
Deﬁnition
3.2.
We
shall
refer
to
ZX
as
the
weight
zero
quotient
of
ΔX
(even
though
it
is
not
literally
a
quotient).
(Here,
the
“Z”
of
ZX
stands
for
the
“zero”
of
“weight
zero
quotient.”)
Now
let
us
ﬁx
a
(continuous)
section
α
:
ΓR
→
ΠXK
Then
α
induces
an
action
of
ΓR
on
ΔX
.
Since
ZX
was
formed
naturally
–
and,
for
that
matter,
group-theoretically
–
from
ΔX
,
we
thus
obtain
an
action
of
ΓR
on
ZX
which,
in
24
general,
will
depend
on
the
choice
of
α.
The
next
issue
we
would
like
to
consider
is
to
what
extent
the
sequence
of
ΓR
-modules
0
→
ZX
[1]
→
ZX
→
ZX
[0]
→
0
admits
a
ΓR
-equivariant
section.
At
any
rate,
this
exact
sequence
deﬁnes
an
extension
class
ηα
∈
H
1
(ΓR
,
(ZX
[0])∨
⊗
ZX
[1])
RK

and
Z
[1]
=
By
Lemma
2.3
(i)
(for
n
=
1
–
here
we
use
that
both
ZX
[0]
=
H0
⊗R
R
K
X
∧2
ZX
[0]
are
“of
weight
zero”),
it
follows
that
this
Galois
cohomology
group
may
be
identiﬁed
naturally
with
2

(H∨
0
⊗R
∧
H0
)
⊗R
RK
K
.
That
is
to
say,
one
may
think
of
ηα
as
a
section
of
a
certain
vector
bundle
over
R
Proposition
3.3.
Suppose
that
α
arises
as
the
ασ
associated
to
some
section
σ
:
S
→
X
(whose
image
avoids
the
marked
points
and
nodes
–
cf.
the
discussion
at
the
beginning
of
this
Section).
Then
ηα
=
0.
Proof.
Since
everything
is
functorial,
one
reduces
immediately
to
the
universal
case,
as
follows:
In
the
present
context,
the
essential
data
that
we
begin
with
is
a
r-pointed
stable
curve
of
genus
g
(i.e.,
f
log
:
X
log
→
S
log
),
plus
a
section
(i.e.,
σ).
The
moduli
stack
for
this
data
is
(a
certain
dense
open
substack
of)
the
tautological
curve
C
→
Mg,r
over
the
moduli
stack
Mg,r
of
r-pointed
stable
curves
of
genus
g
over
Zp
.
Thus,
by
“restriction,”
it
suﬃces
to
prove
the
Proposition
in
the
case
where
S
is
étale
over
the
algebraic
stack
C.
Also,
since
everything
involved
commutes
with
base-extension,
it
is
easy
to
see
that
we
may
assume
that
k
is
algebraically
closed.
Then
over
some
dense
open
T
⊆
(S
−
D)
⊗OK
k,
the
Jacobian
of
X
⊗OK
k
will
be
ordinary.
Thus,
every
point
of
β
∈
S(OK
)
that
maps
Spec(k)
⊆
Spec(OK
)
into
T
deﬁnes
an
ordinary
(in
the
sense
of
Deﬁnition
1.1)
hyperbolic
curve
Yβ
→
Spec(K)
over
K
(by
restricting
(the
complement
of
the
marking
sections
in)
X
→
S
to
β).
Next,
observe
that
that
if
we
restrict
the
section
σ
to
the
point
β,
we
get
a
section
et
σβ
:
Spec(K)
→
Yβ
which
induces
an
action
of
ΓK
on
Δet
Yβ
(i.e.,
the
quotient
ΔYβ
→
ΔYβ
considered
in
Section
1).
By
Lemmas
1.2
and
1.4,
this
action
is,
in
fact,
the
trivial
action.
Now
I
claim
that
in
the
case
of
such
an
ordinary
curve:
The
quotient
ΔYβ
→
Δet
Yβ
(considered
in
Section
1)
induces
a
natural
(in
particular,
ΓK
-equivariant)
isomorphism
of
the
weight
zero
quotient
25
ZYβ
of
ΔYβ
(=

Indeed,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
construction
of
ZYβ
that
the
surjection
ΔYβ
→
Δet
Yβ
induces
a
morphism
from
ZYβ
to
the
“weight
zero
quotient”
(i.e.,
constructed
in
a
fashion
analogous
to
the
construction
of
ZYβ
)
of
Δet
Yβ
.
On
the
other
hand,
since
the
action
of
et
ΓK
on
ΔYβ
is
trivial,
it
follows
that
the
“weight
zero
quotient”
of
Δet
Yβ
is
just
the

it
is
clear
that
the
map
induced
on
abelianizations
by
this
morphism
from
ZYβ
to
this
weight
zero
quotient
of
Δet
Yβ
is
an
isomorphism.
(Indeed,
surjectivity
follows
from
the
fact
that
we
are
dealing
(by
deﬁnition)
with
various
quotients
of
a
single
object;
injectivity
then
follows
from
Proposition
2.4
and
Lemma
2.3

and
the
fact
that

(since

–
cf.
the
discussion
following
Deﬁnition
1.1)
we
conclude
that
we
get
an
isomorphism
as
stated
in
the
“claim.”
This
completes
the
veriﬁcation
of
the
claim.
Thus,
any
minimal
choice
of
generators
of
Δet
Yβ
(which
will
necessarily
be
ﬁxed
by
ΓK
)
deﬁnes
a
splitting
of
the
sequence
of
ΓK
-modules
0
→
ZX
[1]
→
ZX
→
ZX
[0]
→
0
Here
the
ΓK
-action
is
given
by
composing
the
ΓR
-action
considered
above
with
the
morphism
–
well-deﬁned
up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
(which
does
not
bother
us
since
this
inner
automorphism
corresponds
to
a
coboundary
in
the
computation
of
the
cohomology
class
ηα
that
we
are
interested
in)
–
ΓK
→
ΓR
deﬁned
by
β.
But
from
the
deﬁnition
of
the
extension
class
ηα
,
this
means
that
the
restriction
2
ηα
|β
∈
(H∨
0
⊗R
∧
H0
)
⊗R,β
K
of
ηα
to
the
point
β
is
zero.
On
the
other
hand,
if
ηα
is
zero
when
restricted
to
any
such
β
(i.e.,
any
β
∈
S(OK
)
that
maps
Spec(k)
⊆
Spec(OK
)
into
T
),
it
is
clear
that
ηα
itself
must
be
zero.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
Proposition.
Note
that
so
far,
in
this
Section
and
the
last,
we
have
been
dealing
with
families
of
curves,
parametrized
over
a
base
S.
Before
continuing
on
to
the
next
Section,
it
is
worthwhile
to
go
back
to
the
case
of
“a
single
curve”
over
K
in
order
to
make
explicit
the
consequences
for
such
single
curves
of
the
theory
developed
thus
far.
Thus,
let
XK
→
Spec(K)
be
a
hyperbolic
curve.
As
in
Section
1,
we
have
an
exact
sequence
1
→
ΔX
→
ΠXK
→
ΓK
→
1
26
Then
let
us
ﬁrst
note
that
the
theory
reviewed
in
Section
2
can
be
applied
in
the
present
nonparametrized
situation
as
well
to
produce
(following
precisely
the
same
recipe
as
in
the
parametrized
situation
considered
as
above)
a
Lie
algebra
ZX
,
together
with
a
group
ZX

(both
over
K).
Deﬁnition
3.4.
We
shall
refer
to
ZX
as
the
weight
zero
quotient
of
ΔX
.
Let
x
∈
XK
(K).
Then
x
deﬁnes
a
section
αx
:
ΓK
→
ΠXK
(well-deﬁned
up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
arising
from
ΔX
).
Moreover,
αx
deﬁnes
an
action
of
ΓK
on
ZX
.
Proposition
3.5.
of
ΓK
-modules
Relative
to
the
action
of
ΓK
on
ZX
deﬁned
by
αx
,
the
exact
sequence
0
→
ZX
[1]
→
ZX
→
ZX
[0]
→
0
splits.
Proof.
Note
that
this
Proposition
is
not,
strictly
speaking,
a
special
case
of
Proposition
3.3
(i.e.,
where
we
take
S
=
OK
),
since
Proposition
3.3
only
addresses
the
case
where
the
divisor
of
bad
reduction
is
ﬂat
over
OK
.
However,
by
means
of
specialization,
one
can
reduce
the
present
Proposition
to
the
“universal
case”
considered
during
the
proof
of
Proposition
3.3.
Moreover,
in
this
case,
Proposition
3.3
already
tells
us
that
the
relevant
exact
sequence
is
split.
This
completes
the
proof.
Remark.
Let
us
write
(ΔX
)Qp
for
the
full
(i.e.,
not
truncated
as
above)
Malčev
completion
(cf.
[Del],
[NT])
of
ΔX
.
Then
in
some
sense,
Proposition
3.5
above
is
a
truncated
version
of
a
theorem
that
states
“relative
to
the
action
of
ΓK
on
(ΔX
)Qp
deﬁned
by
αx
,
(ΔX
)Qp
is
Hodge-Tate.”
Here,
since
(ΔX
)Qp
is
an
inverse
limit
of
unipotent
algebraic
groups,
one
can
interpret
“Hodge-Tate”
to
mean
that
the
Lie
algebras
of
each
of
these
unipotent
algebraic
groups
are
Hodge-Tate
representations.
In
fact,
it
is
not
diﬃcult
to
prove
that
(ΔX
)Qp
is
Hodge-Tate
(even
for
arbitrary
higher-dimensional
smooth
XK
→
Spec(K))
as
follows:
One
reduces
the
higher-dimensional
case
to
the
curve
case
by
cutting
with
hyperplane
sections.
Then
for
curves,
by
considering
the
universal
case,
one
can
reduce
to
the
case
of
curves
smooth
over
OK
.
Finally,
for
curves
smooth
over
OK
,
one
can
apply
the
techniques
of
[Falt1]
(by
considering
cohomology
spaces
with
coeﬃcients
valued
in
unipotent
algebraic
groups
over
Qp
).
This
shows
that
(ΔX
)Qp
is
Hodge-Tate.
Moreover,
one
can
also
construct
∞
a
nontruncated
“weight
zero
quotient
(ΔX
)Qp
→
ZX
”
(that
is
to
say,
if
XK
is
a
curve
of

∞
genus
g,
then
Z
will
be
(Γ
-equivariantly)
isomorphic
to
the
Malčev
completion
over
K
X
K
of
the
free
group
on
g
generators).
In
fact,
it
is
even
possible
to
show
that
(ΔX
)Qp
is
de
Rham,
but
we
shall
not
pursue
such
issues
here
since
they
are
not
relevant
to
the
proof
of
27
the
main
results
of
this
paper.
Nevertheless,
we
remark
that
this
sort
of
theorem
has
been
veriﬁed
by
A.
Shiho
([Shiho]),
in
a
manuscript
in
preparation.
Section
4:
J-Geometric
Sections
We
maintain
the
notations
of
the
latter
portion
of
Section
3.
Moreover,
we
assume
that
our
curve
XK
→
Spec(K)
is
proper
(hence
of
genus
≥
2)
and
that
XK
(K)
=
∅.
In
this
Section,
we
would
like
to
consider
a
continuous
homomorphism
α
:
ΓK
→
ΠXK
which
deﬁnes
a
section
of
the
surjection
ΠXK
→
ΓK
.
The
section
α
deﬁnes
an
action
of
ΓK
on
ΔX
by
conjugation,
and
hence
also
an
action
of
ΓK
on
ZX
.
In
particular,
we
would
like
to
consider
the
signiﬁcance
of
the
following
condition
on
α:
(∗)spl
The
exact
sequence
of
ΓK
-modules
(relative
to
the
action
deﬁned
by
α)
0
→
ZX
[1]
→
ZX
→
ZX
[0]
→
0
splits.
The
main
result
of
this
Section
is
to
show
that
the
group-theoretic
condition
(∗)spl
is
equivalent
to
the
statement
that
α
is
“J
-geometric”
(a
term
which
means
that
α
acts
in
some
respects
as
if
it
came
from
a
geometric
point
x
∈
XK
(K)
–
see
Deﬁnition
4.3
for
a
precise
deﬁnition).
To
do
this,
ﬁrst
we
need
to
recall
certain
facts
concerning
Jacobians
and
their
funda(d)
mental
groups.
For
d
∈
Z,
let
JX
→
Spec(K)
be
the
Picard
scheme
of
line
bundles
on
XK
(d)
(0)
(d)
of
degree
d.
Thus,
JX
is
a
torsor
over
JX
=
JX
,
the
Jacobian
of
XK
.
Note
that
JX
is
deﬁned
even
if
XK
does
not
admit
any
K-rational
points,
as
the
scheme
representing
the
étale
sheaﬁﬁcation
of
the
usual
Picard
functor
of
degree
d
line
bundles.
Note
that
a
basepoint
x
∈
XK
(Ω)
(where
Ω
is
the
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
of
Section
0)
may
be
regarded
as
a
degree
one
divisor
on
XΩ
=
XK
⊗K
Ω,
hence
(by
multiplying
this
divisor
by
d)
we
(d)
obtain
a
point
xd
∈
JX
(Ω).
This
allows
us
to
deﬁne
the
arithmetic
fundamental
group
(d)
(d)
π1
(JX
,
xd
),
as
well
as
its
geometric
counterpart
π1
(JX
,
xd
).
If
we
form
the
quotient
(d)
K
(d)
of
π1
(JX
,
xd
)
by
the
kernel
of
π1
(JX
,
xd
)
→
Δ
(d)
(i.e.,
the
projection
to
the
maximal
JX
K
pro-p
quotient
of
the
geometric
fundamental
group),
then
we
obtain
a
topological
group
Π
(d)
.
Moreover,
we
have
a
natural
exact
sequence
JX
28
1
→
ΔJ
(d)
→
ΠJ
(d)
→
ΓK
→
1
X
X
(1)
Finally,
the
natural
embedding
XK
→
JX
induces
a
natural
surjection
ΠXK
→
Π
(1)
,
JX
whose
kernel
is
the
commutator
subgroup
of
ΔX
.
Now
let
us
observe
that
we
can
reconstruct
Π
(d)
from
ΠXK
→
ΓK
,
as
follows.
First
of
JX
all,
we
can
reconstruct
Π
(1)
as
the
quotient
of
ΠXK
by
the
commutator
subgroup
of
ΔX
.
JX
(d)
Next,
let
us
observe
that,
since
(for
all
d
∈
Z)
JX
is
a
JX
-torsor,
considering
the
action
(d)
of
JX
on
JX
allows
one
to
identify
Δ
(d)
with
ΔJX
.
Thus,
we
have
an
exact
sequence
JX
1
→
ΔJX
→
ΠJ
(1)
→
ΓK
→
1
X
(1)
(d)
If
we
consider
(for
nonzero
d),
the
morphism
JX
→
JX
given
by
multiplication
by
d,
we
d
see
that
the
result
of
pushing
forward
this
sequence
by
means
of
the
morphism
ΔJX
→
ΔJX
(i.e.,
multiplication
by
d)
gives
rise
to
an
exact
sequence
which
can
be
naturally
identiﬁed
with
the
exact
sequence
1
→
ΔJ
(d)
=
ΔJX
→
ΠJ
(d)
→
ΓK
→
1
X
X
This
completes
our
review
of
Jacobians
and
their
fundamental
groups.
Now
recall
from
the
deﬁnition
of
ZX
[0]
in
Section
3
that
ZX
[0]
may
be
identiﬁed
with

In
particular,
one
has
a

portion
of

JX
Zp
K
morphism
ΔJX
→
ZX
[0].
Thus,
by
pushing
forward
the
exact
sequence
of
the
preceding
paragraph
(for
d
=
1)
by
means
of
this
morphism,
we
obtain
a
morphism
of
exact
sequences
of
topological
groups
as
follows:

Next,
we
would
like
to
consider
sections
of
Π
(1)
→
ΓK
and
ΠZ(1)
→
ΓK
.
Recall
that
the
JX
JX
diﬀerence
between
any
two
sections
of
Π
(1)
→
ΓK
(respectively,
ΠZ(1)
→
ΓK
)
is
given
by
JX
JX
an
element
of
H
1
(K,
ΔJX
)
(respectively,
H
1
(K,
ZX
[0])).
Moreover,
if
θL
,
θM
:
Γ
→
Π
(1)
(1)
are
sections
that
arise
from
geometric
points
L,
M
∈
JX
(K),
then
the
diﬀerence
def
δ
=
θL
−
θM
∈
H
1
(K,
ΔJX
)
29
JX
maps
to
zero
in
H
1
(K,
ZX
[0])
([BK],
Example
3.11
–
cf.
the
proof
of
Lemma
4.1
for
some
more
details).
Thus,
it
follows
that
the
section
θL
[0]
:
ΓK
→
ΠZ(1)
obtained
from
θL
JX
by
composing
θL
with
Π
(1)
→
ΠZ(1)
is
independent
(up
to
composition
with
an
inner
JX
JX
automorphism
of
ΠZ(1)
arising
from
ZX
[0]
⊆
ΠZ(1)
)
of
the
choice
of
L.
In
particular,
as
JX
JX
(1)
long
as
JX
(K)
is
nonempty
(which
is
the
case
here,
since
XK
(K)
has
been
assumed
to
be
nonempty),
we
thus
obtain
a
canonical
section
(well-deﬁned
up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
of
ΠZ(1)
arising
from
ZX
[0]
⊆
ΠZ(1)
)
JX
JX
θgeom
:
ΓK
→
ΠZ(1)
JX
of
ΠZ(1)
→
ΓK
.
JX
Now
let
θ
:
ΓK
→
Π
(1)
be
an
arbitrary
section,
and
let
θ[0]
:
ΓK
→
ΠZ(1)
denote
JX
JX
the
section
induced
by
θ.
Then
taking
the
diﬀerence
between
θ[0]
and
θgeom
deﬁnes
a
cohomology
class
δθ
∈
H
1
(K,
ZX
[0])
=
H0
(where
the
last
equality
follows
from
Lemma
2.3,
applied
in
the
case
RK
=
K).
Now
we
have
the
following
result:
Lemma
4.1.
Suppose
that
the
residue
ﬁeld
k
is
ﬁnite.
Then
there
exists
a
geometric
(1)
point
L
∈
JX
(K)
such
that
θ
=
θL
if
and
only
if
δθ
=
0.
Proof.
This
follows
immediately
from
the
theory
of
[BK],
§3,
especially
Example
3.11,
plus
the
following
observation:
If
H
is
(as
in
Section
3)
the
ΓK
-module
that
arises
as
the
abelianization
of
ΔX
,
then
+
Ker{H
1
(K,
H)
→
H
1
(K,
H
⊗
BDR
)}
(i.e.,
by
Lemma
3.8.1
of
[BK],
“Hg1
”
in
the
notation
of
[BK])
is
equal
to

=
H

(K,
Z
[0])}
Ker{H

(K,
H)
→
H
1
(K,
H
⊗
K)
X
(where
the
last
equality
follows
from
Proposition
2.4
and
Lemma
2.2
(ii)
(for
n
=
1,
j
=
1)).
+
Indeed,
this
equality
of
kernels
follows
by
using
the
natural
ﬁltration
on
BDR
(whose


i
≥
0),
together
with
the
fact
that
H
1
(K,
H

K(i))
=0
subquotients
are
equal
to
K(i),
for
i

0
(by
Proposition
2.4,
Lemma
2.2
(ii)
(for
n
=
1,
j

0)).

Now,
we
return
to
considering
the
section
α
:
ΓK
→
ΠXK
.
Let
β
:
ΓK
→
ΠXK
be
any
section
that
arises
from
some
geometric
point
x
∈
XK
(K).
We
would
like
to
compare
α
and
β,
and,
in
particular,
show
that,
under
the
assumption
(∗)spl
,
α
and
β
are,
in
some
sense
(to
be
speciﬁed
precisely
below),
relatively
close.
Let
ζ
:
ΓK
→
ΔX
be
the
continuous
function
(not
necessarily
a
group
homomorphism)
such
that
α(γ)
=
ζ(γ)
·
β(γ)
∈
ΠXK
for
all
γ
∈
ΓK
.


(respectively,
If
γ

ΓK
,
then
let
us

Note
that
it
follows
from
the
construction
of

that

We

Thus,
it

that

the

In

Remark.
So

with
the

be
interesting
also
to

what

of

For

the

that

it

that

such
questions
are
beyond
the

of

it
is
the
opinion
of
the

that
such
questions
deserve
further

that

Section
5:
The
J-Geometricity
of
K-Valued
Points
Let
K
be
a
p-adic
ﬁeld
with
perfect
residue
ﬁeld.
Let
XK
and
YK
be
proper
hyperbolic
curves
over
K.
Let
UK
be
the
K-scheme
obtained
by
localizing
XK
at
its
generic
point.
Thus,
the
underlying
topological
space
of
UK
consists
of
one
point,
and
the
ring
of
functions
on
UK
is
the
function
ﬁeld
KX
of
XK
.
Note
in
particular
that
we
can
consider
ΠUK
,
ΠYK
.
In
particular,
ΠUK
is
a
certain
quotient
of
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
KX
.
Let
us
assume
that
we
are
given
a
continuous
open
homomorphism
θ
:
ΠUK
→
ΠYK
over
ΓK
.
In
this
Section,
we
would
like
to
begin
the
proof
of
the
main
theorem
of
this
paper
by
showing
that
any
such
θ
necessarily
“maps
geometric
sections
to
J
-geometric
sections.”
(Naturally,
we
will
explain
below
precisely
what
is
meant
by
the
expression
in
quotes.)
First
observe
that
if
x
∈
XK
(K)
is
any
K-valued
point,
then
we
can
form
the
completion
(KX
)x
of
the
ﬁeld
KX
with
respect
to
the
valuation
deﬁned
by
x.
Moreover,
we
have
a
natural
morphism
Π(KX
)x
→
ΠUK
(well-deﬁned
up
to
composition
with
conjugation
by
an
element
of
ΔU
)
whose
image
is
“the”
(more
rigorously:
any
of
the
various
conjugate)
decomposition
group
associated
to
x.
Moreover,
as
is
well-known
(see,
e.g.,
[Ser2]),
(KX
)x
is
(noncanonically)
isomorphic
to
K((t))
(where
t
is
an
indeterminate),
so
Δ(KX
)x
may
be
identiﬁed
with
Zp
(1).
In
particular,
by
forming,
relative
to
some
isomorphism
(KX
)x
∼
=
K((t)),
the
ﬁeld
extension
of
(KX
)x
corresponding
to
adjoining
a
compatible
system
of
p-power
roots
of
t
to
K((t)),
one
sees
immediately
that
Π(KX
)x
→
ΓK
admits
many
sections.
Deﬁnition
5.1.
We
shall
refer
to
as
geometric
any
section
ΓK
→
ΠUK
of
ΠUK
→
ΓK
obtained
by
composing
a
section
of
Π(KX
)x
→
ΓK
with
(any
one
of
the
conjugate
natural
homomorphisms)
Π(KX
)x
→
ΠUK
.
Note,
in
particular,
that
Π(KX
)x
→
ΠXK
factors
through
ΓK
,
so
in
particular,
the
composite
αX
:
ΓK
→
ΠXK
with
ΠUK
→
ΠXK
of
any
geometric
section
αU
:
ΓK
→
ΠUK
is
induced
by
some
point
x
:
Spec(K)
→
XK
.
Let
αU
:
ΓK
→
ΠUK
be
a
geometric
section.
By
composing
αU
with
θ,
we
obtain
a
section
αY
:
ΓK
→
ΠYK
.
In
this
Section,
we
would
like
to
prove
that
αY
is
necessarily
J
-geometric
in
the
sense
of
Deﬁnition
4.3.
To
do
this,
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
we
have
a
diagram
of
continuous
morphisms
ΔU
−→
⏐
⏐θ|Δ

U

ZX
(K)
−→

ZY
(K)
ΔY
33
which
are
compatible
with
the
ΓK
-actions
deﬁned
by
αU
and
αY
on
the
all
the
groups
involved.
(Here,
the
upper
horizontal
morphism
is
obtained
by
composing
ΔU
→
ΔX
with

Δ
→
Z
(K).)
Then
we
have
the
following
X
X

→
Z
(K)

Lemma
5.2.
There
exists
a
(natural)
surjective
ΓK
-homomorphism
ZX
(K)
Y
that
makes
the
above
diagram
commute.
Proof.
Observe
that
the
kernel
of
ΔU
→
ΔX
is
generated
by
inertia
groups
(i.e.,
images
of
the
various
Δ(KX
)x
→
ΔU
),
and
the
action
of
ΓK
on
an
inertia
group
is
via
the
cyclotomic
character,
i.e.,
(in
the
language
of
Hodge-Tate
Galois
representations)
of
weight
one.
It

thus
follows
(from
Lemma
2.2
(ii),
for
n
=
0,
j
=
−1)
that
the
morphism
Δ
→
Z
(K)
U
Y
(obtained
from
the
diagram
above)
factors
through
ΔX
.
Hence,
we
obtain
a
morphism

But
now,
it
follows
immediately
(by
the
universal
property
of
the
truncated
Δ
→
Z
(K).


that
this
morphism
Δ

Z
(K)
This
shows
the
X
Y
X
existence
of
a
morphism
as
claimed
in
the
statement
of
the
Lemma.
The
fact
that
this
morphism
is
surjective
follows
from
the
fact
that
θ
is
open
(which
implies
that
the
induced
ab
morphism
Δab
U
→
ΔY
on
abelianizations
is
open,
hence
surjective
after
tensoring
with
Qp
).

from

Proposition

Let
θ

be
a

over

αU

a

and
αY
:
ΓK

the
composite
of

with
θ.
Then
αY
is
J

(Deﬁnition

Proof.
This
follows
by
combining
Lemma
5.3
with
Proposition
4.4.
Section
6:
F-Geometricity
and
FI-Geometricity
def
Let
K
be
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
.
Let
S
=
Spec(R),
where
R
is
an
OK
-algebra
noncanonically
isomorphic
to
OK
[[t]]
(and
t
is
an
indeterminate).
Let
ηS
be
the
generic
34
def
def
point
of
S
(regarded
as
a
scheme).
Let
ΓS
=
π1
(SK
)
(where
SK
=
S
⊗OK
K,
and
the
“π1
”
is
with
respect
to
some
base-point
which
we
omit
to
simplify
notation);
let
ΓηS
be
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
K(ηS
)
(the
function
ﬁeld
of
S).
Thus,
ΓS
can
be
naturally
regarded
as
a
quotient
of
ΓηS
.
If
H
⊆
ΓηS
is
an
open
subgroup
corresponding
to
some
ﬁnite
étale
covering
ηS

→
ηS
,
then
we
shall
write
ΓηS
for
H;
S

=
Spec(R

for
the
normalization
of
S
in
ηS

and

for
the
quotient
of
ΓηS
corresponding
to
étale
coverings
def

of
SK
=
S


K.
Thus,
S

is
ﬁnite
and
ﬂat
(since
S
is
regular
of
dimension
2,
and
R
is
normal,
hence
an
R-module
of
depth
2)
over
S.
Remark.
For
the
reader
familiar
with
[Mzk2],
we
remark
that
this
Section
and
the
next
are,
in
some
sense,
a
generalization
of
Section
5
of
[Mzk2],
and
play
a
comparable
role
in
the
present
paper
to
that
of
Section
5
in
[Mzk2].
For
the
reader
not
familiar
with
[Mzk2],
we
remark
that,
nevertheless,
we
do
not
assume
any
knowledge
of
[Mzk2]
in
the
following
discussion.
We
begin
by
considering
a
continuous
Zp
[ΓηS
]-module
V
,
where
V
,
as
a
Zp
-module,
is
a
ﬁnite
and
free.
Deﬁnition
6.1.
We
shall
refer
to
V
as
potentially
geometric
if
there
exists
some
open
subgroup
ΓηS
⊆
ΓηS
such
that
the
ΓηS
-module
obtained
by
restricting
the
ΓηS
-action
on
V
to
ΓηS
arises
as
the
Tate
module
of
some
p-divisible
group
G
→
Spec(OK

),
where
K

⊆
RK
is
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
K.
Note,
in
particular,
that
the
ΓηS
-action
on
V
then
factors
through
the
quotient
ΓηS
→
ΓS

.
Moreover,
if
V
is
potentially
geometric,
then
we
may
make
the
following
construction:
Let
us
write
G
for
the
(not
necessarily
connected)
formal
group
(over
OK

)
associated
to
the
p-divisible
group
G
→
Spec(OK

)
of
Deﬁnition
6.1.
Thus,
we
have
a
natural
isomorphism
(of
ﬁnite
ﬂat
group
schemes
over
OK

)
between
the
kernels
G[pn
]
∼
=
G[pn
]
of
multiplication
by
pn
(for
all
n
≥
0)
on
G
and
G.
In
particular,
if
we
consider
the
exact
sequence
(generalizing
the
Kummer
sequence,
which
corresponds
to
the
case
where
G
is
the
formal
group
associated
to
the
multiplicative
group
Gm
)
0
−→
G[pn
]
−→
G
pn
−→
G
−→
0
as
an
exact
sequence
of
sheaves
on
the
ﬁnite
ﬂat
site
of
S

,
then
we
get
a
natural
map
1
(S

,
G[pn
])
G(S

)
→
Hﬂat
35
(where
the
cohomology
group
is
relative
to
the
ﬁnite
ﬂat
topology
on
S

)
for
n
≥
0.
Since
étale
morphisms
are
quasi-ﬁnite
and
ﬂat,
we
also
have
a
natural
morphism
1
1
Hﬂat
(S

,
G[pn])
→
Het
(S

,
G[pn
]K

)
Thus,
if
we
compose
the
above
two
morphisms,
take
the
inverse
limit
with
respect
to
n,
1
and
use
the
fact
that
Het
(S

,
−)
∼
=
H
1
(ΓS

,
−),
we
get
a
natural
morphism
κG
:
G(S

)
→
H
1
(ΓS

,
V
)
which
one
may
regard
as
a
generalization
of
the
Kummer
map
(from
units
of
a
ﬁeld
to
a
certain
Galois
cohomology
group
of
the
ﬁeld).
Remark.
Note
that
when
the
formal
group
G
arises
from
an
abelian
variety
over
OK

,
then
the
cohomology
class
that
one
obtains
by
applying
κG
to
a
point
of
G
coincides
with
the
cohomology
class
that
one
obtains
(cf.
the
discussion
of
Section
4)
by
looking
at
the
morphism
induced
on
arithmetic
fundamental
groups
by
the
corresponding
point
of
the
abelian
variety.
Indeed,
this
is
a
matter
of
general
nonsense
–
cf.,
e.g.,
[Naka2],
Claim
(2.2);
[NTs],
Lemma

that
some

the

under
the
morphism
κG
.
Now
let
XηS
→
ηS
be
a
proper
hyperbolic
curve
over
ηS
such
that
for
some
open
ΓηS
⊆
ΓηS
,
and
some
proper,
hyperbolic
curve
Z
→
Spec(K

)
(where
K

⊆
RK
is
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
K,
and
we
assume
that
Z(K

)
=
∅),
we
have
an
isomorphism
of
ηS

-curves
XηS
×ηS
ηS

∼
=
Z
×K

ηS

Then
we
make
the
following
technical
Deﬁnition
6.3.
We
shall
call
XηS
irreducibly
splittable
if
for
some
open
ΓηS
⊆
ΓηS
,
and
some
proper,
hyperbolic
curve
Z
→
Spec(K

)
(where
K

⊆
RK
is
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
K,
and
we
assume
that
Z(K

)
=
∅),
we
have
an
isomorphism

and,
moreover,
the
(induced)
map
S

→
Spec(OK

)
satisﬁes:
(i)
S

→
Spec(OK

)
admits
a
section;
(ii)
the
morphism
S

→
Spec(OK

)
has
geometrically
irreducible
ﬁbers.
As
usual,
we
have
an
exact
sequence
1
→
ΔXη
=
HX
→
ΠXη
→
ΓηS
→
1
S
S
where
we
write
HX
for
the
abelianization
of
ΔXη
.
Thus,
HX
has
a
natural
structure
of
S
continuous
ΓηS
-module.
Moreover,
as
a
Zp
-module,
it
is
free
of
rank
2gX
(where
gX
is
the
genus
of
XηS
).
Let
us
write
I
HX
→
HX
for
the
quotient
of
HX
by
all
elements
of
HX
on
which
some
open
subgroup
of
ΓηS
acts
via
I
the
cyclotomic
character.
(The
“I”
comes
from
the
fact
that
HX
is
obtained
by
forming
the
quotient
of
HX
by
all
of
its
“inertia-like”
subgroups.)
Next,
let
F
⊆
HX
HX
F
be
the
largest
ΓηS
-submodule
of
HX
which
has
no
nonzero
torsion-free
quotients
HX
→Q
such
that
some
open
subgroup
of
ΓηS
acts
trivially
on
Q.
(Here,
the
“F
”
stands
for
F
“ﬁnite.”
This
is
because
HX
corresponds
to
the
portion
of
HX
that
(potentially)
extends
to
a
p-divisible
group
–
i.e.,
a
direct
limit
of
ﬁnite
ﬂat
group
schemes
–
over
OK

.)
Then
F
I
it
is
well-known
(see,
e.g.,
[FC],
Chapter
III)
that
HX
and
HX
are
Cartier-dual
to
one
F
another,
and,
moreover,
that
HX
is
potentially
geometric
(Deﬁnition
6.1).
(Indeed,
in
[FC],
Chapter
III,
one
ﬁnds
a
discussion
of
how
one
may
obtain
(in
a
natural
fashion)
abelian
varieties
over
K

as
“quotients”
(by
some
group
of
periods)
of
semi-abelian
varieties
that
(potentially)
extend
over
OK

in
such
a
way
that
the
dimensions
of
their
toral
parts
are
the
same
over
the
generic
and
special
points
of
OK

.
If
we
apply
this
theory
to
the
Jacobian
JZ
F
of
the
curve
Z,
then
HX
is
the
Tate
module
of
this
semi-abelian
variety
(that
potentially
I
F
I
is
the
Cartier
dual
of
HX
,
it
thus
follows
that
HX
is
also
extends
over
OK

).)
Since
HX
potentially
geometric.
Let
FI
I
HX
⊆
HX
F
I
F
FI
FI
be
the
image
of
HX
in
HX
.
Thus,
we
have
a
surjection
HX
→
HX
,
and
HX
is
also
potentially
geometric.
Finally,
let
def
M
I
F
HX
=
Ker(HX
→
HX
)
⊆
HX
37
M
(Here,
the
“M”
stands
for
“multiplicative.”
This
is
because
HX
arises
from
the
portion
F
that
corresponds
to
twisted
copies
of
(the
Tate
module
of)
the
multiplicative
group
of
HX
M
Gm
.)
HX
is
also
potentially
geometric.
Next,
we
would
like
to
consider
a
section
α
:
ΓηS
→
ΠXη
of
ΠXη
→
ΓηS
.
Now
recall
S
S
the
isomorphism
XηS
×ηS
ηS

∼
=
Z
×K

ηS

By
composing
α|Γη

:
ΓηS
→
ΠXη
with
the
projection
ΠXη
→
ΠZ
induced
by
this
S
S
S
isomorphism,
we
thus
obtain
a
morphism
ΓηS
→
ΠZ
,
whose
composite
with
ΠZ
→
ΓK

is
the
natural
morphism
ΓηS
→
ΓK

.
Now
let
us
make
the
following
assumption
on
α:

(∗)S
This
morphism
ΓηS
→
ΠZ
factors
through
ΓS

.
Let
us
denote
the
resulting
morphism
by
β
:
ΓS

→
ΠZ
.
Now
let
γ
:
ΓS

→
ΠZ
be
any
morphism
obtained
by
composing
the
natural
morphism
ΓS

→
ΓK

with
some
section
ΓK

→
ΠZ
arising
from
a
geometric
point
∈
Z(K

).
Let
βJ
,
γJ
:
ΓS

→
Π
(1)
be
the
morphisms
obtained
by
composing
β
and
γ,
respectively,
with
JZ
ΠZ
→
Π
(1)
.
Then
the
diﬀerence
βJ
−
γJ
deﬁnes
an
element
JZ

,
HZ
)
δZ
∈
H
1
(SK
hence
an
element

,
HX
)
δX
∈
H
1
(SK

I
I
whose
image
in
H
1
(SK
,
HX
)
we
denote
by
δX
.
Deﬁnition
6.4.

Suppose
that
α
:
ΓηS
→
ΠXη
is
a
section
that
satisﬁes
the
assumpS
tion
(∗)S
above.
Then
we
shall
call
α
F
-geometric
(respectively,
F
I-geometric)
if
some
I

F
nonzero
multiple
of
δX
(respectively,
δX
)
lies
in
the
image
of
Hf1
(SK
,
HX
)
(respectively,
1

FI
1

1

I
Hf
(SK
,
HX
))
in
H
(SK
,
HX
)
(respectively,
H
(SK
,
HX
)).
Note
that
if
α
is
F
-geometric,
it
is
also
automatically
F
I-geometric.
Also,
let
us
observe
that
the
deﬁnition
of
“F
-geometric”
or
“F
I-geometric”
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
γ
(cf.
Lemma
4.1
and
the
discussion
preceding
it).
Indeed,
to
see
this,
it
suﬃces
to
verify

that
some
nonzero
multiple
of
the
class
∈
H
1
(SK
,
HX
)
arising
from
the
diﬀerence
of
two
1

F
γ’s
lies
in
Hf
(SK
,
HX
).
But
the
diﬀerence
of
two
γ’s
(both
of
which
arise
from
a
geometric
point
∈
Z(K

))
deﬁnes
a
point
∈
JZ
(K

)
(where
JZ
is
the
Jacobian
of
Z).
Moreover,
since
the
residue
ﬁeld
of
K

is
ﬁnite,
it
follows
that
some
nonzero
multiple
of
this
point
in
JZ
(K

)
38
extends
to
an
OK

-valued
point
of
the
Néron
model
JZ
of
JZ
over
OK

which
maps
the
special
point
of
Spec(OK

)
to
the
identity
of
JZ
.
On
the
other
hand,
since
G
F
–
i.e.,
the
F
“G”
(cf.
the
discussion
following
Deﬁnition
6.1)
for
the
potentially
geometric
module
HX
–
is
simply
the
formal
group
deﬁned
by
JZ
,
it
thus
follows
that
such
a
point
∈
JZ
(OK

)
deﬁnes
a
point
in
G
F
(OK

)
⊆
G
F
(S

).
Thus,
by
Deﬁnition
6.2,
we
see
that
the
diﬀerence

F
between
the
two
γ’s
lies
in
Hf1
(SK
,
HX
),
as
desired.
Proposition
6.5.
Suppose
that
XS
is
irreducibly
splittable
(cf.
Deﬁnition
6.3).
Then
any
F
I-geometric
α
is
also
F
-geometric.
Proof.
First,
let
us
state
that
throughout
the
proof,
“S

”
will
be
a
ﬁxed
S

satisfying
the
conditions
of
Deﬁnition
6.3.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
the
cokernel
of
the
natural
morphism

F

FI
Hf1
(SK
,
HX
)
→
Hf1
(SK
,
HX
)
is
torsion.
Indeed,
this
follows
from
Deﬁnition
6.2
and
the
fact
that
if
G
F
and
G
F
I
are
the
respective
formal
groups
as
in
Deﬁnition
6.2,
then
the
natural
morphism
G
F
→
G

is
formally
smooth
(hence
surjective
on
S

-valued
points).


I
,
HX
)
whose
image
ζ
I
∈
H
1
(SK

lies
Thus,
if
we
start
with
a
class
ζ
∈
H
1
(SK
1

FI
in
the
image
of
Hf
(SK
,
HX
),
then
(after
replacing
ζ
by
a
nonzero
multiple
of
ζ),
we

,
HX
)
such
that:
(a.)
ζ

lies
in
the
image
may
assume
that
there
exists
a
ζ

∈
H
1
(SK


F

1

I
of
Hf
(SK
,
HX
);
(b.)
ζ
−
ζ
maps
to
0
in
H
(SK
,
HX
).
Moreover,
by
the
deﬁnition
of
def
M
I
HX
=
Ker(HX
→
HX
),
it
follows
that
(b.)
may
be
rewritten
in
the
form:
“ζ

−
ζ
lies
in

M

the
image
of
H
1
(SK
,
HX
)
in
H
1
(SK
,
HX
).”
With
these
observations
in
hand,
it
follows
that
it
suﬃces
to
prove
that

M

(∗)im
The
image
of

in

contained
up

torsion
(i.e.,
up
to
multiplication
by
a
nonzero
integer)
in
the
image
of

F

,
HX
)
in
H
1
(SK
,
HX
).
Hf1
(SK
Note
ﬁrst
that
by
replacing
K

by
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
K

(and
thus
also
enlarging
S

–
note
that
this
does
not
aﬀect
the
validity
of
the
conditions
(i)
and
(ii)
of
Deﬁnition
6.3),
M
we
may
assume
that
the
action
of
ΓS

on
HX
(−1)
(where
the
“(−1)”
is
a
Tate
twist)
is
M
trivial.
(Thus,
in
particular,
as
a
ΓS

-module,
HX
is
isomorphic
to
a
direct
sum
of
a
ﬁnite
number
of
copies
of
Zp
(1).)
On
the
other
hand,
by
Lemma
6.6
below
(and
the
Kummer

,
Zp
(1))
=
{(RK
)×
}∧
(where
the
“∧”
denotes
p-adic
exact
sequence),
it
follows
that
H
1
(SK

,
Zp
(1))
=
{(R
)×
}∧
and
(the
image
of)
completion)
is
generated
up
to
torsion
by
Hf1
(SK

M
,
HX
)
is
generated
up
to
torsion
H
1
(K

,
Zp
(1))
=
{(K

)×
}∧
.
Thus,
it
follows
that
H
1
(SK
1

M
1

M
by
Hf
(SK
,
HX
)
and
(the
image
of)
H
(K
,
HZ
).
Next,
observe
that
the
image
of
H
1
(K

,
HZM
)
in
H
1
(K

,
HZ
)
is
contained
up
to
torsion
in
the
image
of
Hf1
(K

,
HZF
)
in
H
1
(K

,
HZ
).
Indeed,
this
follows
from
the
theory
of
[BK],
39
§3
(cf.
the
proof
of
Lemma
4.1).
Namely,
since
HZM
is
“of
weight
one,”
the
image
of

is
zero,
so
any
cohomology
classes
H
M
⊆
H
in
the
weight
zero
component
of
H
⊗
K
Z
Z

Z

But
M


(K
,
HZ
)
go
to
zero
in
H
(K
,
−)
of
the
weight
zero
component
of
HZ
⊗Zp
K.

in
H
this
means
(as
we
saw
in
Lemma
4.1),
that
such
cohomology
classes
arise
geometrically,
as
desired.
(Note
that,
by
the
above
argument
involving
Néron
models
(in
the
discussion
immediately
preceding
Proposition
6.5),
it
follows
that
(relative
to
pulling
back
cohomology


classes
over
K

to
cohomology
classes
over
SK
),
the
notation
“Hf1
(SK
,
−)”
of
Deﬁnition
1

6.2
is
consistent
with
the
notation
“Hf
(K
,
−)”
of
[BK],
§3.)
Putting
everything
together,
we
thus
see
that
(∗)im
has
been
veriﬁed.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
Proposition.
Lemma
6.6.
For
S

satisfying
condition
(ii)
of
Deﬁnition
6.3,
we
have
that
(RK
)×
is
generated
up
to
torsion
by
(R
)×
and
(K

)×
.
Proof.
Indeed,
condition
(ii)
of
Deﬁnition
6.3
implies
that
if
π
is
a
uniformizing
element
of
OK

⊆
R
,
then
the
ideal
π
·
R
is
contained
in
a
unique
prime
ideal
of
height
one
of
R
.
Let
us
denote
this
prime
ideal
by
℘.
Let
x
∈
R
be
an
element
which
becomes
a
unit
in
RK
.
Then
x
is
invertible
at
every
height
one
prime
of
R
except
(possibly)
℘.
Moreover,
by
replacing
x
by
some
xn
(where
n
is
independent
of
x),
we
may
assume
that
x
has
the
same
valuation
as
π
m
(for
some
nonnegative
integer
m)
in
the
discrete
valuation
ring
R℘
.
It
thus
follows
that
π
−m
·
x
is
a
unit
at
every
height
one
prime
of
R
.
Since
R
is
normal,
this
implies
that
π
−m
·
x
∈
(R
)×
.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
Lemma.
Section

From
F-Geometricity
to
Line
Bundles
In
this
Section,
we
use
some
elementary
algebraic
geometry
(Lemmas
7.1
and
7.2)
to
translate
the
rather
abstract
and
technical
condition
of
“F
-geometricity”
into
a
more
tractable
existence
criterion
(Proposition
7.4)
for
line
bundles.
Let
S
be
the
spectrum
of
a
ﬁeld
of
characteristic
zero.
Let
X

be
a
proper
hyperbolic
curve
of
genus
g
over
S.
Let
(N
)
N
be
a
ﬁxed
positive

We
would
like
to
consider
the
natural
morphism
X

JX
(given
by
mapping
a
point
x
of
X
to
the
line
bundle
OX
(N
·
x)).
Taking
the
product
of
(N
)
this
morphism
with
X
(on
the
right),
we
obtain
a
morphism
ξ
:
X
×S
X

JX
×S
X.
Lemma

There
exists
a

(Δ)
(where

on

Proof.
First,
let
us
take
the
product
of
ξ
with
one
more
copy
of
X
on
the

to
(N

obtain
a

For

Let
Dij
denote
the

In
the
triple

we
consider
the

to
be
the
“true

the
ﬁrst
X
to
be
a
“parameter
space
for
the
family
of

bundles
D12
”
(regarded
as
line
bundles
on
the
“true
curve”
given
by
the
second
factor);
and
the
third
X
to
be
a
“base
extension
X
→
S.”
Over
this
extended
base,
the
“true
curve”
acquires
a
“section”
Δ23.
Thus,
it
follows
from
the
general
theory
of
the
Picard
functor
of
a
family
of
curves
for
which
a
(N
)
section
exists
that
there
exists
a

whose

Now
let
us
consider
the
“determinant
of
the
higher
direct
image
sheaves”
(cf.
[MB],
§1,
for
an
exposition
of
this
notion)
of
L
and
E

for
the
morphisms
X
×S
X

X
→

(N
)
(N
)
and
JX
×S
X
×S
X
→
JX
×S
X
given
by
forgetting
the
third
factor.
We
denote
the
respective
“determinants
of
the
higher
direct
image
sheaves”
of
L
and
E

by
L
and
E.
Thus,
(by
the
functoriality
of
forming
the
“determinant
of
the
higher
direct
image
sheaves”)
L
(N
)
is
a
line
bundle
on
JX
×S
X
such
that
ξ
∗
(L)
=
E.
Moreover,
I
claim
that
we
can
write
E
=
D⊗N
⊗
F
⊗m
(for
m
∈
Z)
where
F
is
a
line
bundle
on
X
×S
X
obtained
by
pulling
back
some
ωX/S
from
the
ﬁrst
factor
of
X
×S
X,
and
tensoring
with
the
pull-back
to
X
×S
X
of
some
line
bundle
M
on
S.
Indeed,
the
“D⊗N
-term”
arises
from
the
fact
that
D12
is
the
pullback
of
D
via
the
projection
X
×S
X
×S
X
→
X
×S
X
under
consideration.
Then
the
diﬀerence
between
the
“determinants
of
the
higher
direct
image
sheaves”
of
the
line
−N
bundles
D13
=
OX×S
X×S
X
(−N
·Δ13)
and
OX×S
×S
X
may
be
computed
using
the
natural
inclusion
−N
=
OX×S
X×S
X
(−N
·
Δ13
)
⊆
OX×S
×S
X
D13
By
using
the
fact
that
the
“determinant
of
the
higher
direct
image
sheaves”
is
multiplicative
on
exact
sequences,
we
thus
obtain
that
this
diﬀerence
is
equal
to
some
power
of
the
pullback
to
X
×S
X
(via
the
projection
to
the
ﬁrst
factor)
of
OX×S
X
(−Δ)|Δ=X
=
ωX/S
.
On
the
other
hand,
the
“determinant
of
the
higher
direct
image
sheaves”
of
the
trivial
line
bundle
on
X
×S
X
×S
X
is
clearly
the
pull-back
(to
X
×S
X)
of
a
line
bundle
M
on
S.
This
gives
us
a
line
bundle
F
of
the
form
discussed
above,
hence
completes
the
proof
of
the
claim.
By
replacing
L
with
L
⊗OS
M−1
,
we
may
assume
that
M
is
trivial.
Moreover,
by
(N
)
Lemma
7.2
below,
there
exists
a
line
bundle
P
on
JX
whose
pull-back
to
X
(via
the
(N
)
natural
morphism
X
→
JX
)
is
some
nonzero
tensor
power
of
ωX/S
.
Thus,
replacing
L
by
a
tensor
product
of
appropriate
powers
of
L
and
(P|J
(N

×S
X
)
completes
the
proof
of

the

Lemma

whose
pull-back
to
X
is
a
nonzero
Proof.
Let
us
ﬁrst
consider
the
case
N
=
g
−
1.
In
this
case,
we
take
P
to
be
the
line
(g−1)
(g−1)
bundle
on
JX
deﬁned
by
the
natural
theta
divisor
on
JX
(i.e.,
the
image
of
the
(g−1)
natural
morphism
from
the
(g
−
1)-fold
product
of
X
to
JX
).
Then
the
fact
that
the
⊗
1
g(g−1)
2
pull-back
of
P
to
X
is
equal
to
ωX/S
is
an
immediate
consequence
of
[MB],
Corollary
2.5:
in
the
notation
of
loc.
cit.,
we
are
interested
here
in
the
case
where
one
takes
n
=
0;
S
=
X;
and
a
:
S
→
X
to
be
the
identity;
then
specializing
the
formula
of
loc.
cit.
to
(a)
the
zero
section
of
the
Jacobian
(note
that
the
restriction
of
“Un
”
in
loc.
cit.
to
the
zero
section
of
the
Jacobian
is
trivial)
proves
the
assertion
concerning
the
pull-back
of
P
to
X.
Next,
let
us
consider
the
case
where
N
is
divisible
by
g
−
1.
Then
the
morphism
(N
)
(g−1)
(N
)
X
→
JX
factors
through
JX
→
JX
.
Moreover,
it
follows
from
the
basic
theory
of
line
bundles
on
abelian
varieties
(see,
e.g.,
[AV],
§23,
the
Corollary
to
Theorem
2
on
p.
231)
that
a
nonzero
tensor
power
of
the
“P”
considered
in
the
previous
paragraph
descends
(g−1)
(N
)
from
JX
to
JX
.
This
completes
the
proof
in
the
case
where
N
is
divisible
by
g
−
1.
Finally,
we
consider
the
case
of
arbitrary
positive
N
.
In
this
case,
we
have
a
natural
(N
)
(N
(g−1))
map
JX

JX
(multiplication
by
g

But,
by
the

we

Thus,
by
pulling
this

bundle
back
to

,
already
have
a
suitable
“P”
on
JX
(N
)
we
obtain
a
suitable
“P”
on
JX
.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
Lemma.

Next,
we
would
like
to
consider
a
section
α
:
ΓS
=
π1
(S)
→
ΠX
of
ΠX
→
ΓS
.
By
(N
)
composing
α
with
π1

applied
to
X

,
we
obtain
a
section

:

(N

Lemma
7.3.
Suppose
that
αN
J
arises
from
a
geometric
section
∈
JX
(S).
Then
there
exists
a
line
bundle
on
X
of
degree
prime
to
p.
Proof.
By
taking
the
ﬁbered
product
(over
ΓS
)
of
α
with
the
identity
on
ΠX
,
we
obtain
a
morphism
αX
:
ΠX
→
ΠX×S
X
.
Since
S
is
the
spectrum
of
the
ﬁeld,
the
group
cohomology
of
ΠX×S
X
computes
the
p-adic
étale
cohomology
of
X
×S
X
(cf.
Lemma
0.4).
Thus,
we
can
form
the
arithmetic
ﬁrst
Chern
class
of
the
line
bundle
D
of
Lemma
7.1
(cf.
def
Deﬁnition
0.3):
c1
(D)
∈
H
2
(ΠX×S
X
,
Zp
(1)).
Let
ζ
=
α∗X
(c1
(D))
∈
H
2
(ΠX
,
Zp
(1)).
On
the
other
hand,
by
composing
αX
with
π1
(−)
of
the
morphism
ξ,
we
obtain
a
morphism
.
Moreover,
by
assumption,
αN
αN
ξ
:
ΠX
→
Π
(N
)
ξ
arises
from
a
geometric
morphism
JX
×S
X
(N
)
(N
)
∗
X
→
JX
×S
X.
Thus,
if
L
is
a
line
bundle
on
JX
×S
X,
we
obtain
that
(αN
ξ
)
(c1
(L))
∈
H
2
(ΠX
,
Zp
(1))
can
be
written
as
c1
(M),
for
some
line
bundle
M
on
X.
Now
recall
that
(N
)
by
Lemma
7.1,
there
exists
a
line
bundle
L
on
JX
×S
X
such
that
ξ
∗
L
is
a
nonzero
tensor
power
of
D.
Thus,
putting
everything
together,
it
follows
that
some
nonzero
multiple
of
42
the
abstract
cohomology
class
ζ
∈
H
2
(ΠX
,
Zp
(1))
can
be
written
in
the
form
c1
(M)
for
some
line
bundle
M
on
X,
i.e.,
m
·
ζ
=
c1
(M)
(for
some
nonzero
m
∈
Z).
Next,
let
us
recall
that
since
ζ
was
constructed
from
D,
the
image
of
ζ
under
the
“degree
map”
H
2
(ΠX
,
Zp
(1))
→
H
2
(ΔX
,
Zp
(1))
∼
=
Zp
is
equal
to
1,
so
deg(M)
=
m.
Thus,
we
can
argue
as
follows
(cf.
[Mzk2],
Lemma
6.1):
Write
m
=
a
·
pb
,
where
a
is
an
integer
prime
to
p,
and
b
is
a
nonnegative
integer.
Thus,
c1
(M)
vanishes
in
H
2
(ΠX
,
(Z/pb
Z)(1)).
But,
by
the
Kummer
exact
sequence,
this
implies
that
there
exists
a
line
bundle
P
on
X
such
that
b
P
⊗p
∼
=
M.
In
particular,
deg(P)
=
p−b
·
deg(M)
=
a,
so
the
existence
of
P
completes
the
proof
of
the
Lemma.
Now
let
us
consider
the
following
situation:
Let
K
be
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
.
Let
XK
→
Spec(K)
and
YK
→
Spec(K)
be
proper
hyperbolic
curves
over
K.
Let
UK
be
the
generic
point
of
XK
.
Moreover,
let
us
assume
that
we
have
been
given
a
continuous
open
homomorphism
over
ΓK
θ
:
ΠUK
→
ΠYK
Now
let
S,
ηS
be
as
at
the
beginning
of
Section
6.
Write
XηS
for
XK
×K
ηS
(and
similarly,
for
UηS
,
YηS
).
Then
by
base-change
(note
that
ΠUη
=
ΠUK
×ΓK
ΓηS
;
ΠYη
=
ΠYK
×ΓK
S
S
ΓηS
),
θ
induces
a
continuous
open
homomorphism
θηS
:
ΠUη
→
ΠYη
S
S
Let
YηS
→
YηS
be
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
induced
by
some
open
subgroup
of
ΠYη
that
S
surjects
onto
ΓηS
.
Note
that
θηS
allows
us
to
deﬁne
the
pull-back
of
YηS
→
YηS
to
UηS
.
Let
Uη
S
→
UηS
be
a
connected
component
of
this
pull-back
which
is
geometrically
connected
over
ηS
.
Note
that
Uη
S
→
UηS
extends
to
a
ﬁnite
(possibly
ramiﬁed)
covering
Xη
S
→
XηS
.
Thus,
Xη
S
is
a
proper
hyperbolic
curve
over
ηS
.
Let
us
suppose
that
YηS
is
irreducibly
splittable
(Deﬁnition
6.3).
Then
it
follows
immediately
that
Xη
S
is
also
irreducibly
splittable.
(Indeed,
the
deﬁnition
of
“irreducibly
splittable”
only
involves
the
base
(i.e.,
S,
S

,
etc.),
plus
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
the
curve,
i.e.,
it
may
be
phrased
entirely
in
terms
of
(the
base
plus)
fundamental
groups.
Thus,
the
fact
that
Xη
S
and
YηS
are
related
by
θηS
is
enough
to
guarantee
that
“YηS
irreducibly
splittable
=⇒
Xη
S
irreducibly
splittable.”)
Next,
we
would
like
to
consider
a
section
αU
:
ΓηS
→
ΠUη
S
of
ΠUη
→
ΓηS
.
Composing
αU
with
π1
(−)
of
the
natural
morphism
Uη
S
→
Xη
S
gives
rise
S
to
a
section
αX
:
ΓηS
→
ΠXη
.
Composing
αU
with
the
morphism
θη
S
:
ΠUη
→
ΠYη
S
S
S
induced
by
θηS
gives
a

αY

The
following
key
result
is
the
culmination
of
our
eﬀorts
in
Sections

Proposition
7.4.
Under
the
circumstances
just
described
above,
let
us
assume
that
αX
is
F
I-geometric
(Deﬁnition
6.4).
Then
it
follows
that
YηS
admits
a
line
bundle
of
degree
prime
to
p.
Proof.
First
observe
that
the
morphism
ΔUη
→
ΔYη
→
HYIη
(where
HYIη
is
as
in
the
S
S
S
S

discussion
preceding
Deﬁnition
6.4)
factors
through
HX

.
(Indeed,
this
follows
by
observη
S
ing,
as
in
the
proof
of
Lemma
5.2,
that
the
inertia
groups
of
ΔUη
map
to
zero
in
HYIη
.)
S
S
I
Thus,
we
obtain
a
ΓηS
-equivariant
morphism
HX
→
HYIη
.
In
particular,
it
follows
by

ηS
S
using
Tate’s
theorem
(i.e.,
Theorem
4
of
[Tate]
–
that
morphisms
between
Tate
modules
of
p-divisible
groups
induce
morphisms
between
the
p-divisible
groups,
hence
morphisms

FI

between
the
respective
formal

that
Hf1
(SK

maps
to

for
any
ηS
ηS
ﬁnite
étale
covering
ηS

→
ηS
of
ηS
as
in
Deﬁnition
6.2.
Next,
I
claim
that
αY
is
F
I-geometric.
Indeed,
this
follows
from
Proposition
5.4,
plus
the
observation
of
the
preceding
paragraph.
In
words:
This
claim
amounts
to
the
claim
(cf.
Deﬁnition
6.4)
that
the
“J
-portion”
of
αY
(i.e.,
the
result
of
composing
αY
with
(1)
ΠYη
→
Π
(1)
,
where
JY

is
the
Picard
scheme
of
line
bundles
of
degree
1
on
YηS
)
diﬀers
JY

S
from
the
“J
-portion”
of
a
constant
(i.e.,
arising
from
a
point
deﬁned
over
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
K
of
the
curve
“Z”
of
the
discussion
of
Section
6)
geometric
section
of
ΠYη
by
a
class
S

in
Hf1
(SK
,
HYFηI
).
On
the
other
hand,
since
we
are
operating
under
the
assumption
that
S
αX
is
F
I-geometric,
we
know
that
the
J
-portion
of
αX
diﬀers
from
the
J
-portion
of
a

FI
constant
geometric
section
of
ΠXη
by
a
class
in
Hf1
(SK
,
HX

).
Moreover,
by
Proposiη
S
S
tion
5.4,
constant
geometric
sections
of
ΠUη
map
to
constant
J
-geometric
(which
is
as
S
good
as
“geometric”
for
us,
since
we
are
only
interested
in
“J
-portions”
here)
sections
of

FI
,
HX
ΠYη
.
Thus,
since
(by
the
observation
of
the
preceding
paragraph)
Hf1
(SK

)
maps
η
S
S

to
Hf1
(SK
,
HYFηI
),
we
conclude
that
αY
is
F
I-geometric,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
S
proof
of
the
claim.
Now
since
YηS
is
also
assumed
to
be
irreducibly
splittable,
it
follows
from
Proposition
6.5
that
αY
is,
in
fact,
F
-geometric.
(N
)
Now
let
us
consider
the
morphism
αN
J
:
ΓηS
→
Π
(N
)
(where
JY

JY

is
the
Picard
scheme
of
line
bundles
of
degree
N
on
YηS
),
for
some
N
>
0,
induced
by
composing
αY
with
ΠYη
→
Π
(N
)
.
Note
that
the
F
-geometricity
of
αY
is,
by
deﬁnition,
a
property
JY

1
concerning
αJ
.
By
the
deﬁnition
of
F
-geometricity
(Deﬁnition
6.4),
it
follows
immediately
(N
)
that
if
N
is
large
enough,
then
αN
J
arises
from
a
geometric
section
JY

(SK
).
Indeed,
the
S
large
N
is
to
take
care
of
the
phrase
“nonzero
multiple
of”
in
Deﬁnitions
6.2
and
6.4,
plus
the
fact
that
a
priori
the
geometric
point
whose
existence
is
guaranteed
by
Deﬁnition
6.2
is
only
deﬁned
over
ηS

,
so
we
may
need
to
apply
the
norm
map
(for
ηS

→
ηS
)
to
get
a
44
geometric
point
over
ηS
,
which
may
cause
N
to
increase
again.
Now,
applying
Lemma
7.3
completes
the
proof
of
the
Proposition.
Remark.
Note
that
Sections
6
and
7
are
made
much
more
technically
diﬃcult
by
the
fact
that
we
start
with
a
morphism
ΠUK
→
ΠYK
rather
than
a
morphism
ΠXK
→
ΠYK
.
Indeed,
the
whole
business
of
distinguishing
“F
-geometric”
from
“F
I-geometric”
arises
because
one
does
not
have
a
proper
theory
of
“p-divisible
groups
of
inﬁnite
rank,”
which
is
the
sort
of
object
that
one
must
deal
with
if
one
tries
to
work
directly
with
HU
(the
abelianization
of
ΔU
)
without
passing
to
HUI
.
Similar
technical
problems
(arising
from
the
fact
that
HU
is
of
inﬁnite
rank)
also
are
the
reason
behind
the
lengthiness
of
Sections
11
and
12.
Section
8:
From
Line
Bundles
to
Tame
Points
In
this
Section,
which
is
something
of
an
appendix
to
that
portion
of
the
paper
constituted
by
Sections
1
through
7,
we
again
apply
some
elementary
algebraic
geometry,
this
time
to
pass
from
line
bundles
to
rational
points
of
the
curve
deﬁned
over
tamely
ramiﬁed
extensions
of
the
given
ﬁeld.
Thus,
let
M
be
a
p-adic
ﬁeld
whose
residue
ﬁeld
kM
is
isomorphic
to
k((t)),
where
k
is
a
ﬁnite
ﬁeld,
and
t
is
an
indeterminate.
Let
XM
be
a
proper
hyperbolic
curve
over
M.
Then
we
have
the
following
result:
Proposition
8.1.
Suppose
that
XM
admits
a
line
bundle
L
of
degree
prime
to
p.
Then
there
exists
a
tamely
ramiﬁed
extension
M

of
M
such
that
XM
(M

)
is
nonempty.
Proof.
By
replacing
L
by
an
appropriate
(prime
to
p)
tensor
power
of
the
original
L,
we
may
assume
that
L
is
very
ample.
Thus,
by
Bertini’s
Theorem,
it
follows
that
there
exists
a
divisor
D
⊆
XM
such
that
L
∼
=
OXM
(D),
and
D
is
étale
over
M.
Let
us
write
D=
r

Di
i=1
where
each
Di
=
Spec(Mi
).
Thus,
Mi
is
a
ﬁnite
ﬁeld
extension
of
M.
Since
deg(D)
is
prime
to
p,
it
follows
that
at
least
one
of
the
Mi
(say,
M1
)
is
such
that
[M1
:
M]
is
prime
to
p.
Let
Mc
be
the
Galois
closure
of
M1
over
M.
Then
it
follows
from
the
elementary
theory
of
p-adic
ﬁelds
(in
particular,
the
fact
that
the
wild
inertia
subgroup
of
ΓM
is
a
normal
pro-p
subgroup
of
ΓM
,
hence
contained
in
any
Sylow-pro-p
subgroup
of
ΓM
–
see,
e.g.,
[Ser2],
Chapter
IV,
§2)
that
Mc
is
tamely
ramiﬁed
over
M.
Thus,
in
particular,
M1
is
tamely
ramiﬁed
over
M,
and
XM
(M1
)
is
nonempty.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
Proposition.
45
Next,
before
continuing,
we
would
like
to
discuss
an
auxiliary
Lemma
that
will
be
useful
when
we
apply
Proposition
8.1.
Let
us
suppose
that
there
exists
a
p-adic
ﬁeld
L
⊆
M
satisfying
the
following
properties:
(1)
We
have
an
inclusion
OL
⊆
OM
,
relative
to
which
mL
·
OM
=
mM
.
(2)
If
kL
is
the
residue
ﬁeld
of
L,
then
k
⊆
kL
,
and
kL
is
a
function
ﬁeld
in
one
variable
over
k.
(3)
The
inclusion
kL
⊆
kM
is
obtained
by
completing
the
function
ﬁeld
kL
at
one
of
its
k-valued
points.
Let
us
suppose,
moreover,
that
there
exists
a
curve
XL
→
Spec(L)
such
that
XM
=
XL
⊗L
M.
Then
we
have
the
following
result:
Lemma
8.2.
Suppose
that
there
exists
a
tamely
ramiﬁed
extension
M

of
M
of
ramiﬁcation
index
e
such
that
XM
(M

)
is
nonempty.
Then
there
exists
a
tamely
ramiﬁed
extension
L
of
L
of
ramiﬁcation
index
e
such
that
XL
(L
)
is
nonempty.
Proof.
Since
tamely
ramiﬁed
extensions
of
M
descend
to
tamely
ramiﬁed
extensions
of
L,
it
is
easy
to
see
that
without
loss
of
generality,
we
may
assume
that
e
=
1,
and
M

=
M.
Thus,
we
must
show
that
XL
admits
a
rational
point
over
some
unramiﬁed
extension
of
L.
Note
that
since
OL
is
a
discrete
valuation
ring,
it
is
well-known
that
XL
def
admits
a
regular
model
XL
→
Spec(OL
).
Let
XM
=
XL
⊗OL
OM
.
Let
us
consider
the
morphism
φ
:
Spec(OM
)
→
Spec(OL
).
Since
ﬁnitely
generated
algebras
over
a
ﬁnite
ﬁeld
are
excellent,
it
follows
that
kM
is
separable
over
kL
(i.e.,
the
morphism
Spec(kM
)
→
Spec(kL
)
is
geometrically
regular).
In
particular,
it
follows
that
φ
is
geometrically
regular.
Since
the
natural
morphism
XM
→
XL
is
obtained
from
φ
by
base-change,
it
thus
follows
that
it,
too,
is
geometrically
regular.
Thus,
the
regularity
of
XL
implies
that
of
XM
.
Now
the
fact
that
XM
(M)
is
nonempty
(by
assumption)
implies
that
there
exist
points
in
the
special
ﬁber
of
XM
at
which
XM
is
smooth
over
OM
.
But
this
implies
(by
descent)
that
there
exist
points
in
the
special
ﬁber
of
XL
at
which
XL
is
smooth
over
OL
,
which,
in
turn,
implies
that
for
some
unramiﬁed
extension
L
of
L,
XL
(L
)
is
nonempty,
as
desired.
Section

Convergence
via
p-adic
Hodge
Theory
Whereas
Sections

formed
a
unit
devoted
essentially
to
showing
Proposition
7.4,
Sections
9
and
10
form
a
new
unit,
devoted
to
showing,
by
means
of
p-adic
Hodge

that
certain
types
of
sequences
of
points
converge
p-adically
to
a
uniquely
determined
point
deﬁned
over
a
relatively
small
ﬁeld.
Thus,
in
particular,
we
shall
start
with
fresh
hypotheses,
as
follows:
46
Let
K
be
a
p-adic
local
ﬁeld,
with
residue
ﬁeld
k.
Let
L
be
a
p-adic
ﬁeld
containing
K
whose
residue
ﬁeld
kL
is
a
function
ﬁeld
in
one
variable
over
k.
Let
us
also
assume
that
k
is
algebraically
closed
in
kL
,
and
that
mK
·
OL
=
mL
.
Let
us
denote
by
def
ΓL/K
=
Ker(ΓL
→
ΓK
)
=
ΓL·K
1

the
“geometric”
fundamental
group
of
L.
Let
HΩ
L
be
the
quotient
of
H
(ΓL/K
,
OL
(1))
by
its
def
torsion
submodule.
Let
XK
→
Spec(K)
be
a
proper
hyperbolic
curve.
Let
XL
=
XK
⊗K
L.
Thus,
as
usual,
we
have
a
group
extension
(obtained
by
pulling
back
1
→
ΔX
→
ΠXK
→
ΓK
→
1
via
ΓL
→
ΓK
)
1
→
ΔX
→
ΠXL
→
ΓL
→
1
Let
us
assume
that
we
are
given
a
continuous,
group
homomorphism
α
:
ΓL
→
ΠXK
whose
composite
with
the
projection
to
ΓK
is
the
natural
morphism
ΓL
→
ΓK
.
As
usual,
α
deﬁnes
a
section
αs
:
ΓL
→
ΠXL
of
ΠXL
→
ΓL
.
Let
us
also
assume
that
α
is
nondegenerate
in
the
sense
that
it
satisﬁes
the
following
group-theoretic
condition:
(∗)non
The
natural
morphism
H

is

def
Let
Ltm
be
a
maximal
tamely
ramiﬁed
extension
of
L.
Let
M
=
(Ltm
)∧
be
its
p-adic
completion.
Since
Ltm
·
K
is
unramiﬁed
over
L
·
K,
and
Galois
cohomology
“ignores
unramiﬁed

we
have
that

In
particular,
since
HΩ
L
is
a
quotient
of
this
cohomology
module,
it
follows
from
assumption
non
(∗)
that
α|ΓLtm·K

is
nontrivial.

For

(cf.
the

preceding
Deﬁnition
0.2
for
an
explanation
of
the
notation
“<

Let
ψn
:
XLn
→
XL
be
the
corresponding
ﬁnite
étale
covering.
Let
XL∞
→
XL
be
the
inverse
limit
of
the
XLn
.
In
this
Section,
we
would
like
to
prove
the
following
assertion:
(∗)con
Suppose
that
we
have
a
sequence
of
points
{
xn
},
where
x
n
∈
def
XLn
(Ltm
).
Let
xn
=
ψn
(
xn
)
∈
XL
(Ltm
).
Then
there
exists
a
subsequence
of
{xn
}
which
converges
p-adically
in
XL
(M).
47
(Note
that
by
choosing
any
proper
model
over
OL
of
XL
,
we
obtain
a
p-adic
topology
on
XL
(Ltm
)
which
is
easily
seen
to
be
independent
of
the
model
chosen.)
By
replacing
K
be
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
K,
we
may
make
the
following
simplifying
assumptions:
(1)
XK
has
stable
reduction.
We
denote
by
X
→
Spec(OK
)
the
unique
stable
extension
of
XK
over
OK
.
We
denote
by
J
→
Spec(OK
)
the
unique
semi-abelian
scheme
over
OK
whose
generic
ﬁber
is
the
Jacobian
of
XK
.
(2)
XK
(K)
is
nonempty.
Note
that
replacing
K
by
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
K
does
not
aﬀect
the
validity
of
the
convergence
assertion
(∗)con
.
Let
us
ﬁx
an
n
≥
1.
Let
us
consider
the
morphism
xn
:
Spec(Ltm
)
→
XK
.
This
morphism
induces
a
morphism
βn
:
ΓLtm
→
ΠXK
→
ΠXK
/(ΔX
)<n>
which
is
well-deﬁned
up
to
conjugation
by
an
element
of
ΔX
.
Then
it
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions
(and
the
fact
that
xn
arose
from
an
Ltm
-rational
point
of
XLn
)
that:
This
morphism
βn
is
equal
to
the
composite
of
α|ΓLtm
:
ΓLtm
→
ΠXK
with
the
natural
projection
ΠXK
→
ΠXK
/(ΔX
)<n>
.
Thus,
in
particular,
βn
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
x
n
.
Moreover,
by
(∗)non
,
it
follows
that
by
taking
n
to
be
suﬃciently
large,
we
may
assume
that
the
restriction
of
βn
to
ΓLtm
·K
(⊆
ΓLtm
)
is
nontrivial.
This
implies,
in
particular,
that
xn
does
not
factor
through
any
ﬁnite
extension
of
K.
Note
that
by
properness,
xn
extends
to
a
morphism
ξn
:
Spec(OLtm
)
→
X
.
Let
K
tm
be
the
algebraic
closure
of
K
in
Ltm
.
Thus,
K
tm
is
a
maximal
tamely
ramiﬁed
extension
of
K.
Let
us
denote
by
ΩOLtm
/OK
tm
the
OLtm
-module
of
p-adically
continuous
diﬀerentials
of
OLtm
over
OK

Thus,
ΩOLtm

is
a
free
OLtm

of
rank
one.

By
diﬀerentiating
ξn

we
obtain
a

Proof.
Suppose
that
xn
is
deﬁned
over
some
ﬁnite
tamely
ramiﬁed
extension
L
of
L.
Suppose,
moreover,
that
L
contains
a
ﬁnite
tamely
ramiﬁed
extension
K

of
K
such
that
mK

·
OL

Then,
if
we
equip
Spec(OK

Spec(OK

and
Spec(OL
)
with
the
log
structures
deﬁned
by
the
special
points,
and
X
with
the
log
structure
whose
monoid
is
the
sheaf
of
functions
invertible
on
the
generic
ﬁber,
we
obtain
a
log
morphism
48
Spec(OL
)log
→
X
log
compatible
with
ξn
and
Spec(OK

)log
→
Spec(OK

Moreover,
since
ωX

ΩX
log
/Spec(OK

,
and
ΩOLtm
/OK
tm
=
OLtm
⊗OL
ΩSpec(OL
)log
/Spec(OK

)log
,
we
thus
obtain
dξn
by
means
of
the
functoriality
of
logarithmic
diﬀerentials.
The
naturality
of
dξn
is
easily
checked
by
looking
at
the
generic
ﬁbers.
def

Let
ΓΩ
X
=
H
(X

Then
we
propose
to
prove
in
the
present
situation
that
(∗)ind
There
exists
a
number
n0
depending
only
on
K
such
that
for

the
natural
morphism
ΓΩ

induced

→
ΩOLtm
/OK
tm
⊗
Z/p
by
dξn
is
independent
of
xn
(i.e.,
depends
only
on
α).
To
keep
the
notation
simple,
let
us
note
that
by
replacing
K
by
a
tamely
ramiﬁed
extension
of
K,
and
then
replacing
L
by
an
unramiﬁed
extension
of
L,
we
may
assume
that
xn
is,
in
fact,
deﬁned
over
L.
(Note
that
replacing
L
and
K
by
extensions
in
this
fashion
will
not
aﬀect
the
validity
of
(∗)ind
.)
Thus,
we
shall
regard
xn
and
ξn
as
morphisms
Spec(L)
→
XK
and
Spec(OL
)
→
X
,
respectively.
def
Ω
Let
P
=
P(ΓΩ
X
).
(That
is,
P
is
the
projective
space
over
OK
deﬁned
by
ΓX
.)
Then
there
is
(by
the
deﬁnition
of
ΓΩ
X
)
a
natural
ﬁnite
morphism
λK
:
XK
→
PK
.
Let
N
→
Spec(OK
)
be
the
Néron
model
of
JX
.
Thus,
J
⊆
N
is
an
open
subscheme
of
N
.
(1)
Since
XK
(K)
is
nonempty,
we
can
use
a
K-rational
point
of
XK
to
identify
JX
with
JX
.
Thus,
we
obtain
a
morphism
XK
→
NK
=
JX
.
By
the
deﬁning
property
of
the
Néron
model,
and
the
fact
that
OL
is
geometrically
regular
over
OK
,
it
follows
that
composing
this
morphism
with
xn
gives
rise
to
a
morphism
ζL
:
Spec(OL
)
→
N
.
Moreover,
(after
possibly
replacing
K
by
a
ﬁnite
unramiﬁed
extension
of
K),
we
may
assume
that
there
exists
some
ζK
:
Spec(OK
)
→
N
such
that
ζK
and
ζL
map
the
special
points
of
Spec(OK
)
and
Spec(OL
),
respectively,
to
the
same
geometric
connected
component
of
the
special
ﬁber
(1)
of
N
.
Thus,
by
translating
by
ζK
,
we
may
assume
that
our
identiﬁcation
of
JX
with
JX
is
such
that
ζL
maps
into
J
⊆
N
.
We
denote
the
resulting
morphism
by
jn
:
Spec(OL
)
→
J
.
Now
let
us
consider
the
ΓK
-module
H
1
(XK

Zp
(1))
=
H

(JK

Zp

Here,
the
identiﬁcation
of
H
1
(XK

Zp
(1))
with
H
1
(JK
,
Zp
(1))
is
the
identiﬁcation
induced
by
XK
→
(1)
JX
∼
=
JX
.
This
identiﬁcation
is
the
same
as
the
standard
identiﬁcation
since
translation
by
K-valued
points
of
J
induces
the
identity
on
H
1
(JK

Zp

Let

cb
may
be
(ΓK
-equivariantly)
identiﬁed
with
H

(GK
,
Zp

for
some
semi-abelian
scheme
G
→
Spec(OK
)
which
can
be
represented
as
an
extension
0→T
→G→A→0
49
of
an
abelian
scheme
A
→
Spec(OK
)
by
a
torus
T
→
Spec(OK
).
Moreover,
the
p-adic
completion
G
of
G
is
equal
to
the
p-adic
completion
J
of
J
.
Indeed,
relative
to
the
identiﬁcation
G
=
J,
the
identiﬁcation
CX
=
H
1
(GK

,
Zp
(1))
is
obtained
as
follows:
Given
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
QK
→
JK
,
we
let
Q
be
the
normalization
of
J
in
QK
,
so
Q
is

→
J
=
G
ﬁnite
over
J
.
Thus,
by
p-adically
completing,
we
obtain
a
formal
morphism
Q
(whose
relative
diﬀerentials
are
annihilated
by
a
power
of
p)
which
can
be
algebrized
to
some
ﬁnite
R
→
G
(whose
relative
diﬀerentials
are
annihilated
by
a
power
of
p).
Thus,
RK
→
GK
is
ﬁnite
étale.
In
other
words,
the
correspondence
between
coverings
given
by
QK
→
RK
induces
a
morphism
H
1
(JK
,
Zp
(1))
→
H
1
(GK
,
Zp
(1))
whose
kernel
is
H
cb
,
and
thus
allows
us
to
identify
H
1
(GK
,
Zp
(1))
with
CX
.
Now
by
p-adically
completing
jn
:
Spec(OL
)
→
J
,
applying
G
=
J,
and
then
algebrizing,
we
thus
obtain
a
morphism
gn
:
Spec(OL
)
→
G.
Moreover,
gn
induces
a
morphism
on
cohomology
groups
H
1
(gn
)
:
H
1
(GK
,
Zp
(1))
→
H
1
(ΓL/K
,
Zp
(1))
Thus,
we
have
a
commutative
diagram
of
ΓK
-modules:
H

,
Zp
(1))

where
the
vertical
morphism
on
the
left
is
the
natural
projection
discussed
in
the
preceding
paragraph,
and
the
horizontal
morphisms
on
the
right
are
the
natural
ones.
Recall
that
1

HΩ
L
is,
by
deﬁnition,
the
quotient
of
H
(ΓL/K
,
OL
(1))
by
its
torsion
submodule.
Now,
by
sorting
through
the
deﬁnitions
(cf.
the
discussion
preceding
Lemma
9.1),
it
is
clear
that
the
composite
morphism
on
the
upper
row
is
completely
determined
by
α
(i.e.,
is
independent
of
the
particular
choice
of
xn
).
Thus,
it
follows
that
the
composite
morphism
on
the
bottom
row
gives
rise
to
a
morphism
n
:
H
1

(1))
→
HΩ
⊗
Z/pn
Z
(GK
,
O
L
K
which
is
completely
determined
by
α.
Moreover,
since
HΩ
L
is
p-adically
separated
(see
Consequence
(2)
of
[Falt1]
below),
it
follows
(from
(∗)non
)
that
n
is
nonzero
for
n
suﬃciently
large.
Now,
note
that
G
is
a
smooth
OK
-scheme
with
an
obvious
compactiﬁcation
G
such
that
G
−
G
is
a
divisor
with
normal
crossings.
(Indeed,
G
is
a
product
of
Gm
-torsors
over
the
OK
-proper
scheme
A,
so
we
simply
compactify
each
of
these
Gm
-torsors
to
a
P1
-bundle.)
In
particular,
it
follows
that
we
can
apply
the
theory
of
[Falt1],
in
the
case
of
good
reduction.
50
Remark.
The
argument
of
[Falt1]
in
the
bad
reduction
case
is
known
to
have
gaps,
which
is
one
reason
why
we
took
pains
to
avoid
applying
[Falt1]
to
JK
.
Another
reason
is
that
in
the
bad
reduction
case,
one
only
has
“Qp
-results,”
not
integral
results
(say,
over
Z/pn
Z),
as
we
need
here.
Let
n0
be
an
integer
such
that
the
p-adic
valuation
of
the
diﬀerent
of
K
over
Qp
is
≤

def
def
the
p-adic
valuation
of
pn0
.
Let
n0
=
n0
+
ordp
(g!).
Let
n0
=
n0
+
2.
The
consequences
of
the
theory
of
[Falt1]
that
we
use
are
as
follows:
∧
(1)
The
ΓK
-module
H
1
(GK
,
K
)
is
Hodge-Tate.
Let
us
denote
by
HΩ
G
the
1

quotient
of
H
(GK
,
OK
(1))
by
the
submodule
that
is
contained
in
the
∧
portion
of
H

(GK
,
K
(1))
of
weight
1.
Thus,
HΩ
G
⊗Zp
Qp
is
of
weight
inv
0.
Let
ΩG
be
the
OK
-module
of
invariant
diﬀerentials
(over
OK
)
on
the
group
scheme
G.
Then
there
is
a
natural
ΓK

morphism

with
an
inverse
“up

of

.”
Here
the
point
of
the
n0
is
to
take
care
of
the
“g!
·
ρ”
of
[Falt1]:
the
2

1
+
1
added
to
n0
is
to
take
1
care
of
the
p−1
≤
1
that
always
arises,
plus
the
additional
e−1
e
<
1
that
arise
from
the
tame
ramiﬁcation
which
we
allow
(see
[Fo],
Theorem
1
for
more
details
on
the
computation
of
[Falt1]’s
“ρ”).
(2)
HΩ
L
is
p-adically
separated.
Moreover,
there
is
a
natural
ΓK

morphism

4.2
of

→
HΩ

Z
with
an
inverse
“up

a
factor

In
particular,
by
considering
weights,
it
follows
that
n
factors
through
the
quotient
HΩ

of

H
(GK

The
morphisms
(and

of

compatible
with

and
the

the

by

and
the

These
assertions
allow
us
to
immediately
conclude
(∗)ind

it
thus

that

This

formally

Now
we
are
ready
to
tackle
the
convergence
assertion
(∗)con
.
Thus,
we
go
back
to
working
over
Ltm
and
K
tm
.
In
particular,
by
composing
xn
with
λK
and
applying
the
valuative
criterion
for
properness,
we
obtain
a
morphism
λn
:
Spec(OLtm
)
→
P
.
Moreover,
this
OLtm
-valued
point
λn
of
the
projective
space
P
is
precisely
the
point
deﬁned
by

(Note
that
here
we
use
the
fact
remarked
above
that
ΩOLtm

is
a
free
OLtm
-module
of
rank
one.)
Thus,
(∗)ind
and
Lemma
9.2
imply
that
the
points
λn
of
P
(OLtm
)
converge
Ltm
)
=
P
(M).
On
the
other
hand,
by
“Krasner’s
Lemma”
p-adically
to
a
point
λ∞
∈
P
(O
(see,
e.g.,
[Kobl],
p.
70),
since
λK
:
XK
→
PK
is
ﬁnite,
it
follows
that
some
subsequence
{xni
}
of
{xn
}
converges
to
a
point
x∞
∈
XK
(M).
This
proves
the
assertion
(∗)con
,
as
desired.
In
fact,
we
can
say
more.
For
m
≥
1,
let
x
m
n+m
in
XLm
(Ltm
)
under
n
be
the
image
of
x
n+m
the
natural
morphism
XL
→
XLm
.
Thus,
we
obtain
a
sequence
{
xm
n
}
(in
the
index
n)
of
m
tm
m
points
of
XL
(L
).
Since
XL
→
XL
is
ﬁnite,
then
by
appying
“Krasner’s
Lemma”
again,
m
see
that
a
subsequence
of
the
sequence
{
xm
n
}
converges
p-adically
in
XL
(M).
Moreover,
by
the
process
of
“Cantor
diagonalization”
(of
elementary
analysis),
we
thus
see
that
we
have
proven
the
following
key
result
(which
is
the
main
result
of
this
Section):
Lemma
9.3.
We
assume
notation
as
in
the
ﬁrst
paragraph
of
this
Section.
Suppose
that
n
∈
XLn
(Ltm
).
Then
there
exists
a
subsequence
we
have
a
sequence
of
points
{
xn
},
where
x
{
xni
}
of
this
sequence
with
the
following
property:
For
each
m
≥
0,
the
sequence
obtained
m
by
projecting
those
x
ni
with
ni
≥
m
to
XLm
(M)
converges
to
some
x
m
∞
∈
XL
(M).
In
particular,
XL∞
(M)
is
nonempty.
m
Proof.
The
last
assertion
is
proven
by
noting
that
the
x
m
∞
∈
XL
(M)
form
a
compatible
∞
system,
hence
deﬁne
a
point
of
x
∞
∞
∈
XL
(M).
52
Finally,
before
proceeding,
we
make
the
following
technically
trivial,
but
important
observation:
Since
the
arithmetic
fundamental
group
of
XL∞
is
just
ΓL
(i.e.,
Im(αs
)),
it
follows
that
the
morphism
ΓM
→
ΠXK
∞
induced
on
fundamental
groups
by
the
image
in
XK
(M)
of
any
point
(e.g.,
x
∞
∞
)
of
XL
(M)
is
none
other
than
the
restriction
of
α
:
ΓL
→
ΠXK
to
ΓM
.
Section
10:
Uniqueness
and
Rationality
of
the
Limit
Point
We
continue
with
the
notation
of
the
preceding
Section.
In
this
Section,
we
would
∞
like
to
show
that
the
point
x
∞
∞
∈
XL
(M)
constructed
in
Lemma
9.3
is
the
unique
element
of
XL∞
(M),
and
that
it
in
fact
descends
to
a
point
of
XL∞
(L).
We
remark
that
much
of
the
material
of
this
Section
is
not
absolutely
logically
necessary
for
the
proof
of
the
main
results
of
this
paper,
but
is
included
partly
for
aesthetic
reasons,
and
partly
because
its
inclusion
(in
the
opinion
of
the
author)
makes
the
proof
of
the
main
results
of
the
paper
more
transparent.
First,
let
us
make
the
trivial
observation
that
any
point
in
XL∞
(M)
arises
as
a
x
∞
∞
(as
n
tm
in
Lemma
9.3)
for
some
sequence
of
x
n
∈
XL
(L
).
(Indeed,
this
follows
by
using
the
fact
that
M
=
(Ltm
)∧
to
approximate
the
images
of
the
given
point
in
the
various
XLn
(M)’s.)
Thus,
without
loss
of
generality,
we
can
apply
the
results
of
the
discussion
of
Section
9
to
our
analysis
of
an
arbitrary
point
of
XL∞
(M).
Now
recall
the
limit
point
λ∞
∈
P
(M)
of
the
discussion
following
Lemma
9.2.
This
limit
point
is
clearly
independent
of
the
choice
of
the
particular
sequence
{
xn
}
under
∧
consideration
–
i.e.,
it
depends
only
on
α.
More
precisely,
λ∞
∈
P
(M)
⊆
P
(L
)
is
the
point
deﬁned
by
the
surjection
∧

Qp
=
ΩOL
/OK
⊗OL
L
∧
K
induced
by
α
(cf.
the
discussion
preceding
Lemma
9.2).
Note
that
ΓL
acts
naturally
on
all
of
these
modules,
and
that
this
surjection
is
ΓL
-equivariant.
Indeed,
this
follows
by
transport
of
structure
from
the
fact
that
α
is
deﬁned
on
ΓL
,
not
just
on
ΓLtm
·K
.
Thus,
we
conclude
the
following
∞
Lemma
10.1.
The
image
λ∞
∈
P
(M)
of
x
∞
∞
∈
XL
(M)
under
the
natural
morphism
XL∞
→
XK
→
PK
is
independent
of
x
∞
∞
and,
moreover,
λ∞
is
deﬁned
over
L.
53
The
next
step
is
to
observe
that
this
argument
can
be
modiﬁed
so
as
to
show
that
n
the
image
of
x
∞

the
projective
space

by
the
diﬀerentials
on

is
independent
of
x
∞
∞
and
deﬁned
over
L.
To
see
this,
we
need
to
introduce
some
new

First,

observe

the

of

Then,
in
order
to
apply
the
argument
of
Section
9,
we
must
show
that:
(After
replacing
K
by
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
K
which
is
independent
of
N
m),
zm
maps
the
special
point
of
Spec(OL

)
to
the
same
component

of

as
some

point
of
NZ

.

Ltm

Ltm

(see
Lemma
10.2
below
for
an
alternate
formulation.)
To
show
this,
we
reason
as
follows:

in
L
tm
.
Thus,
L

tm
is
a
totally
unr
for
the
maximal
unramiﬁed
extension
of
L
Let
us
write
L


is
a
union
of
ﬁnite
Galois
extensions


.
In
particular,
L
tamely
ramiﬁed
extension
of
L
unr
which
are
of
degree
(over
L

unr
)
prime
to
p.
In
particular,
it
follows
that
the
cokernel
of
L
of
the
inclusion
Comp(NZ
n
)
→
Comp(NZ
n
)

Lunr

Ltm
is
annihilated
by
integers
prime
to
p.
(Indeed,
this
follows
by
applying
the
“trace
map”

tm
over
L
unr
)
to
the
second
“Comp,”
and
observing
that
(since
(for
subextensions
of
L

tm
/L

unr
)
clearly
acts
trivially
on
Comp(NZ
n
))
this
trace
map
is
just
multiplication
Gal(L

Ltm
unr
is
an
unramiﬁed
extension
of
by
some
integer
prime
to
p.)
On
the
other
hand,
since
L

it
follows
(essentially
from
the
deﬁnition
of
the
Néron
model)
that
NZ
n
=
NZ
n
.
In
L,

Lunr

L

particular,
since
L
is
a
discretely
valued
ﬁeld,
it
follows
that
Comp(NZ
n
)
is
ﬁnite.
In
other

L
words,
we
conclude
that:
the
p-torsion
of
Comp(NZ
n
)
is
annihilated
by
some
(ﬁnite)

Ltm
power
of
p.
We
are
now
ready
to
prove
the
following
Lemma:

Indeed,
without

a
whose

Now
let
us
assume
n

(by
enlarging
K
–
independently
of
m)
that
all
of
the
p-torsion

of

rational

Since
all

it
thus
follows
that

as

Now
that
we
have
Lemma
10.2,
we
can
use
the
extended
morphism
of
Lemma
10.2
to
construct
the
analogue
of
the
morphism
“gn
”
of
Section
9
(over
some
tamely
ramiﬁed
extension
of
K).
Then
the
rest
of
the
argument
of
Section

goes
through
without
diﬃculty.
More
precisely:

(That
is,

Then
there
is
(by

natural
ﬁnite

Let

the

Then,
just

the

converge
to
a

Finally,
just
as
we

for
Lemma

λn∞
is

Now
let
us
recall
some
basic
facts
on
hyperelliptic
curves:
Lemma
10.4.
Let
Q
be
a
proper
hyperbolic
curve
over
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
Ω
of
characteristic
zero.
Then:
(1)
If
Q
is
hyperelliptic
(i.e.,
admits
a
“g21
,”
or
linear
system
of
dimension
1
and
degree
2),
then
the
g21
is
unique.
(2)
If
Q
is
non-hyperelliptic,
then
the
canonical
morphism
from
Q
into
the
projective
space
associated
to
H
0
(Q,
ωQ/Ω
)
is
an
embedding.
(3)
Suppose
that
W
→
Q
is
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering,
where
W
is
connected.
Then
if
Q
is
non-hyperelliptic,
so
is
W
.
(4)
Suppose
that
W
→
Q
(where
W
is
connected)
is
a
cyclic
étale
covering
of
degree
m
>
2.
Then
W
is
non-hyperelliptic.
Thus,
in
particular,
none
of
the
XLn
is
hyperelliptic,
for
n
≥
2.
Proof.
For
proofs
of
assertions
(1)
and
(2),
we
refer
to
[Harts],
Chapter
IV,
§5,
Propositions
5.2
and
5.3.
As
for
(3),
the
push-forward
of
a
g21
on
W
via
W
→
Q
is
a
g21
on
Q,
so
(3)
follows
immediately.
Now
let
us
consider
assertion
(4).
Let
σ
be
a
generator
of
the
Galois
group
of
W
over
Q.
If
W
admits
a
g21,
it
is
unique,
hence
stabilized
by
σ.
But
this
means
that
there
exists
some
rational
function
fW
on
W
in
this
g21
which
satisﬁes
σ
−1
(fW
)
=
T
(fW
),
where
T
is
some
linear
fractional
transformation
with
coeﬃcients
in
Ω.
Note
that
since
σ
has
ﬁnite
order,
so
does
T
.
Thus,
if
we
diagonalize
T
(by
choosing
a
diﬀerent
fW
),
we
may
assume
that
σ
−1
(fW
)
=
λ
·
fW
,
for
some
nonzero
λ
∈
Ω.
(Note
that
T
cannot
be
parabolic
(i.e.,
a
transformation
of
the
form
fW
→
fW
+
λ,
for
some
m
nonzero
λ
∈
Ω)
since
T
is
of
ﬁnite
order
and
Ω
is
of
characteristic
zero.)
Thus,
fW
(which
56
is
a
constant
multiple
of
the
norm
(relative
to
W
→
Q)
of
fW
)
deﬁnes
a
rational
function
fQ
on
Q.
Now
fQ
is
contained
in
some
g21
on
Q,
so
its
zeroes
have
order
equal
to
1
or
2.
On
the
other
hand,
fQ
has
an
mth
root
in
the
function
ﬁeld
of
W
,
so
it
follows
from
the
assumption
that
m
>
2
that
the
covering
W
→
Q
must
be
ramiﬁed
at
the
zeroes
of
fQ
,
which
is
absurd.
This
contradiction
completes
the
proof.
We
summarize
our
eﬀorts
in
Sections
9
and
10
as
follows:
Corollary
10.5.
Let
M
be
the
p-adic
completion
of
a
maximal
tamely
ramiﬁed
extension
Ltm
of
L.
Suppose
that
we
are
given
a
nondegenerate
α
:
ΓL
→
ΠXK
,
which
thus
gives
rise
to
XLn
,
XL∞
.
Suppose
that
for
each
n
≥
0,
XLn
(Ltm
)
is
nonempty.
Then
it
follows
that
the
set
XL∞
(M)
consists
of
precisely
one
point,
which
is,
in
fact,
contained
in
XL∞
(L)
⊆
XL∞
(M).
In
particular,
there
exists
a
unique
L-valued
point
of
Spec(L)
→
XK
whose
induced
morphism
on
fundamental
groups
(for
an
appropriate
choice
of
base-points)
is
the
morphism
α
:
ΓL
→
ΠXK
.
∞
Proof.
Indeed,
if
x
∞
if
n
≥
2,
the
image
of
x
∞
∞
∈
XL
(M),
then
by
Lemma
10.4,
∞
in
n
n
n
∞
X
XL
(M)
is
determined
by
the
image
λ∞
of
x
∞
in
P
(M).
But,
by
Lemma
10.3,
λn∞
is
∞
n
independent
of
x
∞
and
deﬁned
over
L.
Thus,
it
follows
that
the
image
of
x
∞
∞
in
XL
(M)
∞
(for
n
≥
2)
is
independent
of
x
∞
∞
and
deﬁned
over
L.
But,
by
the
deﬁnition
of
XL
,
this
∞
∞
means
that
x
∞
itself
is
“independent
of
x
∞
”
and
deﬁned
over
L.
(In
other
words,
XL∞
(M)
consists
of
precisely
one
point,
which
is,
in
fact,
deﬁned
over
L.)
The
last
sentence
is
a
formal
consequence
of
the
rest
of
the
Corollary.
This
completes
the
proof.
Section
11:
Hodge-Tate
Representations
of
Inﬁnite
Rank
Let
K
be
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
.
Let
XK
→
Spec(K)
be
a
proper
hyperbolic
curve
over
K.
Let
UK
be
its
generic
point.
Let
HU
be
the
abelianization
of
ΔU
.
Thus,
HU
is
a
Zp
-ﬂat
topological
ΓK
-module
of
inﬁnite
rank.
Note
that
we
have
a
natural
surjection
I
I
HU
→
HX
→
HX
(cf.
the
discussion
following
Deﬁnition
6.3
for
the
deﬁnition
of
HX
).
M
Let
HU
⊆
HU
be
the
kernel
of
this
surjection.
Note
that
the
inertia
groups
(deﬁned
by
closed
points
of
XK
)
of
ΔU
all
map
into
HUM
.
Let
HUP
⊆
HUM
denote
the
closure
of
the
image
of
all
these
inertia
groups.
(Here
the
“P
”
stands
for
“points.”)
Thus,
HU
/HUP
may
be
identiﬁed
with
HX
,
hence
is
of
ﬁnite
rank
over
Zp
.
In
this
Section,
we
would
like
to
analyze
HU
,
and,
in
particular,
HUP
in
greater
detail.
For
simplicity,
let
us
assume
(by
replacing
K
by
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
K)
that
XK
has
stable
reduction
over
OK
,
and
that
there
exists
a
K-valued
point
x
∈
XK
(K).
Let
℘
∈
XK
be
a
closed
point
of
XK
.
Then
there
are
ﬁnitely
many
points
y1
,
.
.
.
,
yr
∈
57
XK
(K)
=
Hom(Spec(K),
XK
)
that
map
to
℘.
For
i
=
1,
.
.
.
,
r,
let
Iyi
⊆
ΔU
denote
“the”
inertia
group
(well-deﬁned
up
to
conjugation
by
an
element
of
ΔU
)
associated
to
yi
.
Thus,
projection
to
the
quotient
ΔU
→
HU
yields
a
map
def
I℘
=
r

Iyi
→
HUP
i=1
Note,
moreover,
that
I℘
has
a
natural
structure
of
ΓK
-module
(given,
for
instance,
by
conjugating
by
the
image
of
a
section
ΓK
→
ΠUK
(cf.
Deﬁnition
5.1)
induced
by
x
∈
XK
(K)
–
note,
however,
that
the
ΓK
-action
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
x).
Relative
to
this
ΓK
-action
on
I℘
,
the
above
morphism
is
ΓK
-equivariant.
Moreover,
by
letting
℘
range
over
all
closed
points
of
XK
other
than
that
deﬁned
by
x,
we
obtain
a
continuous
ΓK
-equivariant
morphism
def
I℘
→
HUP
Ξ
:
Mx
=
℘=x
In
fact,
Lemma
11.1.
The
morphism
Ξ
is
an
isomorphism.
Proof.
Note
that
ΠUK
is
equal
to
the
inverse
limit
of
ΠVK
,
where
the
limit
is
taken
over
all
open
subsets
VK
⊆
XK
−
{x}.
For
such
a
VK
,
we
can
deﬁne
HVP
just
as
we
deﬁned
HUP
,
and
it
is
well-known
that
HVP
is
the
direct
sum
of
the
I℘
,
where
the
sum
is
taken
over
all
℘
∈
XK
−
{x}
−
VK
–
indeed,
this
follows
from
the
well-known
(from
elementary
algebraic
topology)
structure
of
the
homology
group
of
a
Riemann
surface
obtained
by
removing
a
ﬁnite
number
of
points
from
a
compact
Riemann
surface.
Passing
to
the
limit
proves
the
Lemma.
Next,
we
would
like
to
deﬁne
a
quotient
I℘
→
I℘T
as
follows:
Note
that
if
K℘
is
the
residue
ﬁeld
of
XK
at
℘,
then
the
ΓK
-module
I℘
(−1)
(where
the
“(−1)”
is
a
Tate
twist)
may
be
naturally
identiﬁed
with
Zp
[HomK
(K℘
,
K)].
(Here,
Zp
[a
set]
denotes
the
free
Zp
module
generated
by
the
elements
of
the
set.)
Thus,
there
exists
a
unique
nonzero
quotient
I℘
(−1)
→
Q℘
stabilized
by
ΓK
such
that
ΓK
acts
trivially
on
Q℘
.
Moreover,
Q℘
is
a
free
Zp
-module
of
rank
one.
Let
I℘
→
I℘T
be
the
quotient
obtained
by
tensoring
I℘
(−1)
→
Q℘
with
Zp
(1).
Moreover,
by
taking
the
product
of
these
quotients,
we
obtain
a
quotient
def
Mx
→
MxT
=
I℘T
℘=x
Let
HUP
→
HUT
be
the
quotient
corresponding
to
this
quotient
under
the
isomorphism
Ξ.
Thus,
the
ΓK
-action
on
HUT
(−1)
is
trivial.
Moreover,
HUP
→
HUT
has
the
following
universal
property:
58
Lemma
11.2.
Let
N
be
a
Zp
-ﬂat
topological
ΓK
-module
such
that
ΓK
acts
trivially
on
N
(−1).
Then
any
continuous
ΓK
-morphism
HUP
→
N
factors
through
HUT
.
Proof.
This
follows
immediately
from
the
construction
of
HUT
.
T
Now
let
us
deﬁne
the
subquotient
HX
of
HU
as
follows:
First,
let
HUF
⊆
HU
denote
the
F
inverse
image
of
HX
⊆
HX
under
the
projection
HU
→
HX
(cf.
the
discussion
following
F
T
Deﬁnition
6.3
for
the
deﬁnition
of
HX
).
Now
let
HX
be
the
quotient
of
HUF
by
the
kernel
P
T
of
HU
→
HU
.
Thus,
we
have
an
exact
sequence
of
topological
ΓK
-modules
T
F
0
→
HUT
→
HX
→
HX
→0
Let
us
take
the
continuous
dual
Homcont
Zp
(−,
Zp
)
of
this
exact
sequence.
This
gives
us
a
new
exact
sequence
of
topological
ΓK
-modules
F
T
→
CX
→
CUT
→
0
0
→
CX
(Here,
one
may
think
of
the
“H’s”
as
standing
for
“homology,”
and
the
“C’s”
as
standing
for
“cohomology.”)
In
particular,
we
have
CUT
=

∧
Z℘T
℘=x
where
Z℘T
is
deﬁned
to
be
the
dual
of
I℘T
.
If
we
pull-back
this
last
exact
sequence
by
Z℘T
⊆
CUT
,
we
obtain
exact
sequences
of
topological
ΓK
-modules
F
→
C℘T
→
Z℘T
→
0
0
→
CX
T
is
obtained
by
all
of
which
are
of
ﬁnite
rank
over
Zp
.
Moreover,
it
is
clear
that
that
CX
summing
these
extensions
(over
℘)
and
then
p-adically
completing.
T
We
would
like
to
show
that
CX
is
“Hodge-Tate”.
Unfortunately,
typically
the
theory
of
Hodge-Tate
Galois
representations
only
goes
through
for
modules
of
ﬁnite
rank
over
Zp
.
On
the
other
hand,
C℘T
is
of
ﬁnite
rank
over
Zp
.
Thus,
our
approach
in
the
following
will
T
be
to
use
the
C℘T
to
show
that
CX
is,
in
some
sense,
like
a
Hodge-Tate
representation.
First,
let
X℘
be
the
singular
curve
obtained
from
XK
by
considering
the
subsheaf
of
OXK
of
functions
f
such
that
f(x)
=
f(℘).
Let
J℘
be
the
generalized
Jacobian
associated
to
X℘
(see,
e.g.,
[Ser1],
Chapitre
I,
§1).
Thus,
J℘
is
an
extension
of
the
abelian
variety
JX
by
some
torus.
Moreover,
the
p-adic
Tate
module
T
(J℘
)
of
J℘
ﬁts
into
an
exact
sequence
of
ΓK
-modules
59
0
→
I℘
→
T
(J℘
)
→
HX
→
0
In
particular,
one
sees
immediately
that
there
exists
a
quotient
J℘
→
J℘
whose
p-adic
Tate
module
ﬁts
into
the
exact
sequence
0
→
I℘T
→
Tp
(J℘
)
→
HX
→
0
obtained
by
pushing
forward
the
preceding
exact
sequence
by
I℘
→
I℘T
.
Moreover,
C℘T
F
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
dual
of
the
pull-back
of
this
exact
sequence
by
HX
→
HX
.
T
∨
1
Alternatively,
C℘
may
be
identiﬁed
with
a
certain
quotient
Tp
(J℘
)
=
H
(J℘
,
Zp
)
→
C℘T
F
(whose
kernel
is
the
dual
of
HX
/HX
).
Note,
in
particular,
that
J℘
is
an
extension
of
JX
by
the
trivial
torus
Gm
.
Thus,
J℘
extends
to
a
semi-abelian
variety
over
OK
(cf.
the
paragraph
following
Theorem
2.6
of
Chapter
I
of
[FC]).
Next,
let
us
recall
(from
the
theory
of
[FC],
Chapters
I
through
III)
that
JX
may
be
constructed
as
a
certain
rigid
analytic
quotient
of
a
semi-abelian
variety
JX
which
has
good
reduction
(i.e.,
the
dimension
of
the
torus
part
is
constant)
over
OK
by
some
discrete
group.
The
kernel
of
the
induced
pull-back
map
on
cohomology
H
1
(JX
,
Zp
)
→
H
1
(JX
,
Zp
)
F
.
If
we
pull-back
the
extension
J℘
→
JX
from
JX
to
JX
,
is
precisely
the
dual
of
HX
/HX
we
then
obtain
an
extension
J℘
of
JX
by
the
trivial
torus
of
dimension
one.
Moreover,
J℘
has
good
reduction
over
OK
.
Finally,
the
quotient
H
1
(J℘
,
Zp
)
→
H
1
(J℘
,
Zp
)
is
precisely
the
quotient
H
1
(J℘
,
Zp
)
→
C℘T
referred
to
in
the
preceding
paragraph.
Now,
just
as
in
Section
9,
we
can
apply
the
theory
of
[Falt1]
(in
the
case
of
good
def
reduction)
to
J℘
.
Let
F0
=
H
1
(X,
OX
),
where
X
→
Spec(OK
)
is
the
stable
extension
of
XK
over
OK
.
Let
F℘
be
the
space
of
invariant
diﬀerentials
on
J℘
,
where
J℘
→
Spec(OK
)
is
the
extension
of
J℘
to
a
semi-abelian
variety
over
OK
.
Thus,
F0
and
F℘
are
both
free
of
ﬁnite
rank
over
OK
.
Then
it
follows
from
the
theory
of
[Falt1]
(speciﬁcally,
Theorems
2.4
and
3.1
of
II.
of
[Falt1])
that


There
exists
a

K
K
which
has
an
inverse
up
to
pn
,
where
n
is
a
nonnegative
integer
that
is
independent
of
℘.
Note
that
the
fact
that
n
is
independent
of
℘
is
of
profound
importance
in
what
follows.
Moreover,
if,
instead
of
J℘
,
we
had
worked
with
J℘
(which,
in
general,
has
“bad
(though
stable)
reduction”),
or
J℘
(which
has
only
potentially
stable
reduction
–
i.e.,
for
general
℘,
one
needs
to
enlarge
K
in
order
to
get
stable
reduction),
we
would
have
been
unable
to
obtain
this
crucial
“independence
of
℘”
from
the
theory
of
[Falt1].

Now
observe
that
F℘
ﬁts
into
a
natural
exact
sequence
F
→
F℘
→
Z℘
→
0
0
→
FX
def
F
=
H
0
(X,
ωX/OK
),
and
Z℘
is
deﬁned
so
as
to
make
the
above
sequence
exact.
where
FX
T
Now
let
FX
be
the
sum
of
these
extensions
over
all
℘;
let
FUT
be
the
direct
sum
of
the
Z℘
over
all
℘.
Thus,
we
have
an
exact
sequence
of
ﬂat
OK
-modules
F
T

FX
→
FUT

0

Thus,
by
taking
the
p-adic
completion
of
the
sum
of
the
morphisms
in
(∗)℘
,
and
using
the
facts
that:
(i)
the
“n”
of

independent
of

T
T
(ii)
both

we
obtain
the

T
Next,
we
would
like
to
relate
FX
to
a
certain
space
of
diﬀerentials
on
X,
as
follows:
def
Let
E
be
a
ﬁnite
set
of
closed
points
of
XK
.
Let
S
=
Spec(OK
),
and
let
us
endow
S
with
the
log
structure
deﬁned
by
the
monoid
OS
−
{0};
denote
the
resulting
log
scheme
by
S
log
.
Let
X
log
[E]
→
S
log
be
the
pointed
stable
log-curve
(see,
e.g.,
[Mzk3],
Section
3,
for
more
details
on
this
terminology)
extending
XK
⊗K
K,
equipped
with
all
the
points
61
def
of
XK
(K)
that
map
to
primes
in
E
as
marked
points.
Let
L[E]
=
ωX
log
[E]/Slog
.
Then
if
E
⊆
E

,
we
get
a
natural
morphism
X
log
[E

]
→
X
log
[E],
which
lies
under
a
morphism
of
sheaves
L[E]
→
L[E

].
Thus,
by
taking
the
projective
limit
of
the
(X
log
[E],
L[E])
as
E
ranges
over
all
ﬁnite
sets
of
closed
points
of
XK
,
we
obtain
(X
log
[∞],
L[∞]).
Moreover,
note
that
H
0
(X[∞],
L[∞])
is
a
ﬂat,
p-adically
separated
OK
-module.
If
E
contains
x
and
℘,
then
it
is
easy
to
see
that
we
get
a
natural
inclusion
F℘
→
H
(X[E],
L[E]),
which
extends
to
a
morphism
F℘
⊗OK
OK
→
H
0
(X[E],
L[E])
whose
cokernel
is
torsion
free.
Taking
the
limit
with
respect
to
E,
we
thus
obtain
a
map
F℘
⊗OK
OK
→
H
0
(X[∞],
L[∞]).
In
fact,
it
is
not
diﬃcult
to
see
that,
by
summing
over
the
F℘
for
all
℘
=
x,
we
get
a
morphism
0
def
T
FX
⊗OK
OK
→
F∞
=
H
0
(X[∞],
L[∞])
whose
cokernel
is
torsion
free.
Moreover,
this
morphism
remains
injective
after
p-adic
completion.
Thus,
we
see
from
Proposition
11.3
that
we
get
a
morphism
T


→
F
∧
(−1)
⊗Z
p
O
Φ
:
CX
∞
K
(where
the
“∧”
denotes
p-adic
completion).
Moreover,
the
kernel
of
Φ
is
of
weight
zero.
def
Finally,
if
N
is
a
positive
integer,
let
G∞
[N
]
=
H
0
(X[∞],
L[∞]⊗N
).
Thus,
G∞
[N
]
is
a
free
OK
-module
of
inﬁnite
rank
(such
that
G∞
[1]
=
F∞
),
and
we
have
a
natural
multiplication
morphism
⊗N
O
K
F∞

G∞[N

Section
12:
The
Preservation
of
Relations
The
purpose
of
this
Section
is
to
show
how
the
material
of
Section
11
will
be
applied
in
Section
13
to
show
the
“preservation
of
relations.”
We
maintain
the
notation
of
Section
11.
Moreover,
let
us
assume
that
we
have
been
given
a
continuous
open
homomorphism
over
ΓK
θ
:
ΠUK
→
ΠYK
(where
YK
→
Spec(K)
is
a
proper
hyperbolic
curve
over
K).
For
simplicity,
let
us
assume
(by
enlarging
K)
that
YK
extends
to
a
stable
curve
Y
→
Spec(OK
)
over
OK
,
and
that
the
ΓK
-action
on
HYM
(−1)
(cf.
the
discussion
following
Deﬁnition
6.3
for
an
explanation
of
the
notation
“H
M
”)
is
trivial.
Next,
observe
that
θ
induces
a
continuous
morphism
of
ΓK
-modules
HU
→
HY
whose
cokernel
is
torsion.
Note
that
this
morphism
induces
62
a
map
HUF
→
HYF
(cf.
the
discussions
following
Deﬁnition
6.3
and
Lemma
11.2
for
an
explanation
of
the
notation
“H
F
”)
whose
cokernel
is
torsion.
Moreover,
the
restriction
of
this
morphism
to
HUP
(cf.
the
discussion
at
the
beginning
of
Section
11
for
an
explanation
of
the
notation
“HUP
”)
maps
into
HYM
,
hence
(by
Lemma
11.2
and
the
fact
that
ΓK
acts
T
trivially
on
HYM
(−1)),
we
get
a
morphism
HX
→
HYF
whose
cokernel
is
torsion.
Taking
T
the
dual
of
this
morphism
yields
an
injection
CYF
→
CX
(where
CYF
is
the
dual
of
HYF
).
Topologically
tensoring

dividing
out
by
the
“weight
zero
part,”
and
applying
the
morphism

considered
at

we
thus
obtain
(after
further

this,
we
mean
the
following:

def
i.e.,
the
“relations.”
In
the
following,
we
would
like
to
state
a
certain
assertion
that
will
be
proven
in
the
next
Section,
and
explain
why
this
assertion
implies
that
ΨN
“preserves
relations.”
First,
let
us
introduce
the
notation
necessary
to
state
the
assertion.
Suppose
that
E
is
a
ﬁnite
set
of
points
of
XK
(K).
Then
the
pointed
stable
curve
X
log
[E]
→
Spec(OK
)
introduced
at
the
end
of
Section
11
is
deﬁned
over
K,
i.e.,
we
have
X
log
[E]OK
→
Spec(OK
).
Let
p
∈
X[E]OK
be
a
generic
point
of
the
special
ﬁber
of
X[E]OK
.
Let
Spf(OL
)
be
the
completion
of
the
localization
of
X[E]OK
at
p.
Thus,
L
(the
quotient
ﬁeld
of
OL
)
is
a
p-adic
ﬁeld
whose
residue
ﬁeld
is
k(p)
(i.e.,
the
residue
ﬁeld
of
X[E]OK
at
the
prime
p),
and
we
have
a
canonical
L-valued
point
ξ
L
∈
XK
(L).
Let
ΩL/K
denote
the
module
of
p-adically
continuous
diﬀerentials
of
L
over
K.
Thus,
ΩL/K
is
an
L-vector
space
of
dimension
one.
Moreover,
note
that
we
have
a
natural
restriction
morphism
(induced
by
ξ
L
)

∧
KK
→
ΩL/K
⊗
F∞
Thus,
if
we
compose
this
morphism
with
the
morphism

→
F
∧
H
0
(Y,
ωY
/OK
)
⊗OK
O
∞
K
63
considered
above,
we
get
a
morphism


→
ΩL/K
⊗
KK
κL
:
H
0
(Y,
ωY
/OK
)
⊗OK
O
K
Next,
let
us
observe
that
the
coverings
of
XK
deﬁned
by
subgroups
of
ΠUK
are
étale
at
the
point
ξ
L
.
Thus,
it
follows
that
ξ
L
induces
a
natural
morphism
αL
U
:
ΓL
→
ΠUK
(well-deﬁned
up
to
conjugation
by
an
element
of
ΔU
)
whose
composite
with
ΠUK
→
ΓK
L
is
the
natural
morphism
ΓL
→
ΓK
.
Let
αL
Y
:
ΓL
→
ΠYK
be
the
composite
of
αU
with
θ.
Then
the
assertion
that
will
be
proven
in
Section
13
is
the
following:
(∗)L−pt
Suppose
that
p
satisﬁes
the
condition
that
κL
is
not
identically
zero.
Then
it
follows
that
there
exists
a
point
(ξ

)L
∈
YK
(L)
such
that

L
αL
Y
arises
from
(ξ
)
.

L
Note
in
particular,
that
if
αL
Y
arises
from
(ξ
)
,
then
it
follows
immediately
that
the
grouptheoretically
constructed
morphism
κL
coincides
(cf.
the
application
of
the
theory
of
[Falt1]
discussed
in
Section
9)
with
the
natural
restriction
map
on
diﬀerentials
induced
by
(ξ

)L
.
Thus,
if
ρ
∈
RN
is
a
relation,
then
it
follows
that
the
restriction
of
ΨN
(ρ)
∈
(G∞
[N
])∧
to


Ω⊗N
L/K
⊗K
K
is
zero.
This
argument
already
leads
one
to
believe
that
there
should
be
some
sort
of
connection
between
(∗)L−pt
and
the
“preservation
of
relations.”
In
fact,
we
have
the
following:
Proposition
12.1.
Suppose
that
(∗)L−pt
always
holds
(i.e.,
for
all
data
of
the
sort
discussed
above).
Then
ΨN
(RN
)
=
0,
for
all
positive
integers
N
.
def
Proof.
Suppose
that
ρ
∈
RN
is
such
that
ψ

=
ΨN
(ρ)
=
0.
By
dividing
ψ

by
a
suitable
element
of
OK
,
we
obtain
an
element
ψ
∈
(G∞
[N
])∧
such
that
ψ
≡
0
(mod
mK
)
(where
mK
⊆
OK
is
the
maximal
ideal).
Let
us
write
k
for
the
residue
ﬁeld
OK
/mK
.
Write
ψ
for
ψ
considered
modulo
mK
.
Then
ψ
is
a
section
of
L[E]⊗N
⊗
k
for
some
E.
By
enlarging
K,
we
may
assume
that
E
consists
solely
of
K-valued
points
of
XK
.
Moreover,
since
ψ
is
nonzero,
there
exists
some
irreducible
component
of
the
special
ﬁber
of
X[E]⊗k
over
which
ψ
is
nonzero.
If
we
choose
p
(in
the
above
discussion)
to
be
such
that
p
⊗OK
OK
is
this


irreducible
component,
then
it
follows
that
the
restriction
of
ψ
∈
(G∞
[N
])∧
to
Ω⊗N
L/K
⊗K
K
will
be
nonzero.
Now
I
claim
that
p
satisﬁes
the
condition
that
κL
is
not
identically
zero:
Indeed,
if
κL
were
identically
zero,
then
it
would
follow
that
κ⊗N
would
be
identically
L

⊗N

zero.
But
the
restriction
of
ψ
to
Ω
⊗K
K
(which
is
assumed
to
be
nonzero)
is
a
nonzero
L/K
⊗N
K-multiple
of
κL
(ρ)
(which
would
have
to
be
zero).
This
contradiction
proves
the
claim.
Thus,
we
are
in
a
position
to
apply
(∗)L−pt
.
As
discussed
in
the
paragraph
preceding


this
Proposition,
it
then
follows
that
the
restriction
of
ψ
to
Ω⊗N
L/K
⊗K
K
is
zero.
Thus,
we
get
a
contradiction.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
Proposition.

Remark.
In
[Mzk2],
where
one
only
considers
isomorphisms
of
π1
’s,
as
opposed
to
homomorphisms
as
we
do
here,
there
is
no
need
to
place
(as
we
did
in
(∗)L−pt
)
the
condition
on
p
that
κL
be
not
identically
zero.
Because
in
the
present
context
it
is
necessary
to
include
such
a
condition
on
p
in
(∗)L−pt
,
the
author
at
ﬁrst
did
not
see
how
it
would
be
possible
to
prove
the
“preservation
of
relations”
in
the
present
context.
However,
in
fact,
in
order
to
prove
the
preservation
of
relations
(Proposition
12.1),
it
suﬃces
to
consider
only
p
for
which
one
knows
already
that
κL
is
not
identically
zero.
This
observation
arose
in
discussions
between
the
author
and
A.
Tamagawa.
Section
13:
The
Preservation
of
L-Points
The
purpose
of
this
Section
is
to
verify
the
assertion
(∗)L−pt
discussed
in
Section
12.
The
technique
is
similar
to
that
employed
in
[Mzk2]
(although
we
do
not
assume
any
knowledge
of
[Mzk2]
in
the
following
discussion).
We
continue
with
the
notation
of
the
preceding
Section.
In
particular,
we
assume
that
we
have
been
given
a
continuous
open
homomorphism
over
ΓK
θ
:
ΠUK
→
ΠYK
Moreover,
we
assume
that
XK
extends
to
a
stable
curve
X
→
Spec(OK
).
Let
p
be
as
in

→
X
(that
is,
X

is
what
we
denoted
by
X[E]O
(∗)L−pt
.
Thus,
we
have
a
blow-up
X
K

→
Spec(OK
).
Choose
a
in
Section
12),
and
p
is
a
generic
point
of
the
special
ﬁber
of
X

aﬃne,
geometrically
connected
open
neighborhood
W
of
p
in
the
special
ﬁber
of

Let
T
be
the

whose

ring
RT
is
such
that
Spf(RT

Thus,
T

RT

p-adic
topology)
is
the
completion
of
X
is
(p-adically)
formally
smooth,
and
T
⊗
k
=
W
.
By
abuse
of
notation,
we
shall
write
p
for

Let
us
write
ηT
for
the
generic

prime
of
T
that
maps

the
original

under

X.
point
of
T
(regarded
as
a
scheme).
Let
L
be
the
quotient
ﬁeld
of
the
p-adic
completion
of
(RT
)p
.
Thus,
L
is
a
p-adic
ﬁeld
whose
residue
ﬁeld
is
k(W
)
(the
function
ﬁeld
of
W
).
ηT
T
L
Note
that
we
have
natural
morphisms
ξX
:
T
→
X;
ξX
:
ηT
→
XK
;
ξX
:
Spec(L)
→
ηT
L
XK
;
ξU
:
ηT
→
UK
;
ξU
:
Spec(L)
→
UK
.
Let
αηUT
:
ΓηT
→
ΠUK
be
the
morphism
ηT
determined
(up
to
conjugation
by
an
element
of
ΔU
)
by
ξU
.
Similarly,
we
have
αL
U
:
ηT
η
T
L
L
ΓL
→
ΠUK
.
Composing
αU
,
αU
with
θ
gives
αY
:
ΓηT
→
ΠYK
,
αY
:
ΓL
→
ΠYK
.
Now
let
ΔY

⊆
ΔY
be
a
p-derivate
(see
Deﬁnition
0.2)
of
ΔY
.
Thus,
ΔY

is
an
open,
characteristic
subgroup
of
ΔY
.
Note
that
αηYT
deﬁnes
a
section
aηYT
:
ΓηT
→
ΠYη
of
T
ΠYη
→
ΓηT
.
Write
ΠYη
for
the
open
subgroup
Im(aηYT
)
·
ΔY

⊆
ΠYη
.
Thus,
ΠYη
gives
T
T
T
T
rise
to
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
YηT
→
YηT
65
Moreover,
there
exists
some
ﬁnite
étale
covering
ηT

→
ηT
such
that
Y
YηT
×ηT
ηT

∼

×K

ηT

=
ZK
Y


for
some
curve
ZK

→
Spec(K
),
where
K
is
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
K
contained
in
K(ηT

).
Let
T

be
the
normalization
of
T
in
ηT

.
Then
T

→
T
is
ﬁnite
(since
ηT
is
of
characteristic
zero)
and
generically
étale.
By
means
of
θ,
we
can
pull-back
the
above
covering
to
UηT
:
Thus,
we
obtain
an
open
subgroup
ΠUη
⊆
ΠUη
,
which
corresponds
to
some
ﬁnite
étale
covering
Uη
T
→
UηT
T
T
(which
is
geometrically
connected
over
ηT
since
ΠUη
contains
the
graph
of
αηUT
in
ΠUη
=
T
T
ΓηT
×ΓK
ΠUK
).
This
covering
extends
to
a
ﬁnite,
possibly
ramiﬁed
covering
Xη
T
→
XηT
.
Moreover,
we
have
an
isomorphism

ηT

for
some

→

By
enlarging
K
,
we
may
assume
that
this
curve
has
a
stable
extension
Z
X
→
Spec(OK

).
ηT
:
ηT
→
UK
.
Now
it
follows
Next,
let
us
go
back
to
considering
the
morphism
ξU
ηT
ηT
)
tautologically
from
the
way
we
deﬁned
αY
(i.e.,
the
fact
that
it
comes
originally
from
ξU
ηT
ηT
ηT


that
ξU
lifts
naturally
to
a
point
ξU

:
ηT
→
UηT
.
Let
ξX

:
ηT
→
XηT
be
the
result
of
composing
this
morphism
with
Uη
T
→
Xη
T
.
Moreover,
by
restricting
to
ηT

,
we
get
a
point
η
ηT

X
X
ξXT
:
ηT

→
Xη
T

.
Projecting
to
ZK

,
we
thus
get
a
point
ξ
X
:
ηT

→
ZK

.
Moreover,
it
Z

T

→
Z
X
,
where
T

⊆
T

is
easy
to
see
that
this
morphism
extends
to
a
morphism
ξZ
X
:
T
is
an
open
subscheme
obtained
as
the
“D(f)”
(i.e.,
the
complement
of
V
(f)
⊆
T

)
for
some
f
∈
Γ(T

,
OT

)
with
the
property
that
f
is
nonzero
at
every
generic
point
of
the
special
ﬁber
of
T

→
Spec(OK

).
Indeed,
this
follows
from
the
following
two
facts:
(i)
we
ηT

X
already
have
an
extension
to
TK

,
since
ZK

→
XK
is
ﬁnite,
and
ξX
:
ηT
→
XK
extends


to
TK
;
(ii)
to
extend
from
TK

to
some
T
,
it
suﬃces
to
apply
the
valuative
criterion
for
properness
(since
Z
X
→
Spec(OK

)
is
proper).
Next,
let
us
consider
the
morphism
T

⊆
T

→
T
.
Clearly
(after
possibly
enlarging
K
)
there
exists
a
closed
point
t
∈
T
such
that
if
we
let
S
be
the
completion
of
T
at
t,
then
the
morphism
S

→
S
obtained
by
base-changing
T

→
T
by
S
→
T
has
the
following
properties:
(i)
S

→
S
is
ﬁnite
and
ﬂat;
(ii)
S

is
a
ﬁnite
disjoint
sum
of
connected
components
which
are
geometrically
irreducible
over
OK

;
(iii)
each
of
these
components
admits
a
section
over
OK

.
Let
S

be
any
one
of
these
connected
components.
Then
we
have
the
following:

Lemma
13.1.
The
scheme
S

is
normal.
Proof.
(Note
that
this
is
not
entirely
obvious
since
it
is
not
clear
that
T
is
excellent.)
First,
I
claim
that
the
(ﬂat)
morphism
S
→
T
is
geometrically
regular.
Indeed,
over
the
generic
66
ﬁber,
this
follows
from
the
fact
that
S
is
regular
and
generically
of
characteristic
zero;
over
a
closed
point
of
TK
or
T
,
either
the
ﬁber
of
the
morphism
S
→
T
is
(schematically)
isomorphic
to
the
given
closed
point,
or
it
is
empty.
Thus,
it
remains
to
check
what
happens
over
the
height
one
prime
of
T
which
is
the
special
ﬁber
of
T
→
Spec(OK
).
But
over
this
prime,
the
geometric
regularity
of
S
→
T
follows
from
the
excellence
of
T
⊗
k
=
W
(which
is
ﬁnitely
generated
over
a
ﬁnite
ﬁeld).
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
claim.
Thus,
it
follows
that
S

→
T

is
geometrically
regular.
Moreover,
T

is
normal;
hence,
we
obtain
that
S

is
normal,
as
desired.
Thus,
S

→
S
satisﬁes
the
properties
listed
in
Deﬁnition
6.3.
Moreover,
if
we
apply
the
base-change
S
→
T
to
all
the
objects
in
the
above
discussion,
it
is
easy
to
see
that
we
are
in
the
situation
discussed
in
Proposition
7.4.
Note,
in
particular,
that
the
existence
of
the

T


morphism
ξZ
→
Z
X
shows
that
the
condition
(∗)S
(cf.
the
discussion
preceding
X
:
T
Deﬁnition
6.4)
is
satisﬁed
by
αηXS
:
ΓηS
→
ΠXη
.
In
fact,
we
also
have
the
following:
S
Lemma
13.2.
αηXS
is
F
-geometric,
hence
also
F
I-geometric.

T

X
Proof.
Indeed,
ﬁrst
observe
that
restricting
ξZ
.
X
gives
rise
to
a
morphism
ξ1
:
S
→
Z

Since
S
was
constructed
so
as
to
admit
a
section
over
OK

,
let
σ
:
Spec(OK

)
→
S

be
such
a
section.
Then
we
may
form
the
composite
ξσ
:
S

→
Z
X
of
the
structure
morphism
S

→
Spec(OK

)
with
ξ1
◦
σ.
Now
observe
that
ξ1
and
ξσ
both
deﬁne
sections
def
of
ZSX
=
Z
X
×OK

S

→
S

(which
coincide
over
Im(σ)).
Let
D1
,
Dσ
⊆
ZSX
be
the
Weil
divisors
which
are
the
images
of
these
two
sections.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
by
Lemma
13.3
below,
these
two
Weil
divisors
are
Q-Cartier.
Hence
it
follows
that
there
exists
a
positive
integer
N
such
that
N
·
D1
and
N
·
Dσ
are,
in
fact,
Cartier
divisors,
so
we
may
def
form
the
line
bundle
L
=
OZ
X
(N
·
D1
−
N
·
Dσ
).
Note
that
the
line
bundle
L
is
trivial
over
S
Im(σ)
⊆
S

,
hence
over
the
closed
point
of
S

.
Let
JZ
X
→
Spec(OK

)
be
the
unique
semiX
abelian
scheme
whose
generic
ﬁber
is
the
Jacobian
of
ZK

.
Then
it
follows
that
L
deﬁnes
an
S

-valued
point
of
JZ
X
which
arises
from
an
S

-valued
point
of
the
formal
completion
of
JZ
X
at
the
identity.
But,
sorting
through
the
deﬁnitions
(in
particular,
Deﬁnitions
6.2,
6.4)
reveals
that
this
implies
that
αηXS
is
F
-geometric,
hence
also
F
I-geometric
(cf.
the
paragraph
following
Deﬁntion
6.4).
def
Lemma
13.3.
The
scheme
ZSX
=
Z
X
×OK

S

is
normal,
and,
moreover,
any
Weil
X
divisor
D
⊆
ZS

arising
as
the
graph
of
an
OK

-morphism
ξD
:
S

→
Z
X
is
Q-Cartier.
Proof.
By
Lemma
13.1
above,
S

is
normal.
Moreover,
since
ZSX
is
a
generically
smooth
stable
curve
over
S

,
one
checks
easily
that
the
conditions
“R1
”
and
“S2”
of
Serre
(see,
e.g.,
[Mats],
Chapter
7,
§17.I,
Theorem
39)
are
satisﬁed
by
ZSX
,
so
ZSX
is
normal.
Now
recall
that
to
say
that
a
Weil
divisor
is
“Q-Cartier”
simply
means
that
some
nonzero
multiple
of
that
Weil
divisor
is
Cartier.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
since
the
graph
of
ξD
is
deﬁned
by
a
67
single
equation
in
a
neighborhood
of
any
point
of
the
smooth
locus
of
Z
X
→
Spec(OK

),
it
suﬃces
to
check
that
D
is
Q-Cartier
in
a
neighborhood
of
the
nodes
of
the
special
ﬁber
of
Z
X
→
Spec(OK

).
In
fact,
it
even
suﬃces
to
check
that
D
is
Q-Cartier
over
the
spectrum
of
the
completion
of
the
local
ring
of
ZSX
at
such
a
node.
Thus,
let
us
write
A
=
Γ(S

,
OS

);
def
def
B
=
OK

[[x,
y]]/(xy
−
π
n
);
def
C
=
A[[x,
y]]/(xy
−
π
n
)
where
π
∈
OK

is
a
uniformizer,
and
n
is
a
positive
integer.
Here,
we
think
of
B
(respectively,
C)
as
the
result
of
completing
Z
X
(respectively,
ZSX
)
at
a
node
(respectively,
at
the
inverse
image
of
this
node
via
the
projection
ZSX
→
Z
X
).
Recall
that
S

is
aﬃne,
so
S

=
Spec(A).
Now
ξD
is
given
by
some
morphism
B
→
A.
Write
sx
,
sy
∈
A
for
the
images
of
x
and
y,
respectively,
under
this
morphism.
Note
that
sx
·
sy
=
π
n
∈
A.
Moreover,
the
restriction
DC
of
the
subscheme
D
to
Spec(C)
is
deﬁned
by
the
equations
x
−
sx
,
y
−
sy
,
i.e.,
DC
=
V
(x
−
sx
,
y
−
sy
).
Now
let
us
consider
the
regular
function
x
−
sx
on
Spec(C).
I
claim
that
the
ideals
(x
−
sx
)
and
(x
−
sx
,
y
−
sy
)
in
C
coincide
in
C[
π1
].
Indeed,
this
follows
from
the
following
equation:
y
−
sy
=
−y
·
sy
1
(x
−
sx
)
∈
C[
]
n
π
π
Thus,
we
conclude
that
on
Spec(C),
the
Weil
divisor
DC
is
linearly
equivalent
to
a
Weil
divisor
E
on
Spec(C)
which
is
supported
on
the
special
ﬁber
FC
of
Spec(C)
→
Spec(OK

).
On
the
other
hand,
the
fact
that
S

→
Spec(OK

)
is
geometrically
irreducible
implies
that
(FC
)red
has
precisely
two
irreducible
components,
namely,
V
(x)red
and
V
(y)red
.
Thus,
it
follows
that
any
divisor
supported
on
FC
is
Q-Cartier,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
Lemma.
Thus,
(by
Lemma
13.2)
we
may
apply
Proposition
7.4
to
conclude
that
YηS
admits
a
line
bundle
of
degree
prime
to
p.
Moreover,
by
Proposition
8.1
and
Lemma
8.2,
it
thus
follows
that:
def
YL
=
YηT
×ηT
Spec(L)
has
a
rational
point
over
some
tamely
ramiﬁed
extension
L
of
L.
It
is
this
key
result
that
will
allow
us
to
conclude
the
proof
of
(∗)L−pt
.
Let
us
review
what
we
have
done
so
far,
from
the
point
of
view
of
objects
over
YL
.
L
First,
we
have
a
section
aL
Y
:
ΓL
→
ΠYL
of
ΠYL
→
ΓL
(deﬁned
by
αY
).
Moreover,
given
def
any
p-derivate
ΔY

⊆
ΔY
,
we
obtain
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
YL
→
YL
deﬁned
by
ΠY

=
L
L

Im(aL
Y
)
·
ΔY

⊆
ΠYL
.
Under
these
circumstances,
we
just
showed
that
YL
necessarily
has
L
68
a
rational
point
over
some
tamely
ramiﬁed
extension
of
L.
Moreover,
tracing
through
the
deﬁnitions,
it
is
easy
to
see
that
the
assumption
placed
on
p
in
(∗)L−pt
that
κL
be
not
identically
zero
means
precisely
(in
the
language
introduced
at
the
beginning
of
Section
9)
that
aL
Y
is
nondegenerate.
It
thus
follows
that
we
can
apply
Corollary
10.5
to
conclude
that:

L
aL
Y
:
ΓL
→
ΠYL
arises
from
some
geometric
point
(ξ
)
∈
YL
(L).
In
other
words,
the
proof
of
(∗)L−pt
has
been
completed.
Thus,
by
Proposition
12.1,
we
conclude
the
following:
Corollary
13.4.
Let
θ
:
ΠUK
→
ΠYK
be
a
continuous
open
homomorphism
over
ΓK
.
Then
θ
“preserves
relations,”
i.e.,
(in
the
notation
of
Section
12),
we
have
ΨN
(RN
)
=
0,
for
all
positive
integers
N
.
Note
that
in
[Mzk2]
(where
we
essentially
dealt
with
the
case
where
θ
is
an
isomorphism),
the
preservation
of
relations
is
already
enough
to
conclude
the
proof
of
the
main
theorem.
In
the
present
context,
however,
because
of
the
fact
that
HU
is
of
inﬁnite
rank,
it
is
necessary
to
go
through
one
more
intermediate
technical
step
before
we
can
complete
the
proof
of
the
(ﬁrst
part
of
the)
ﬁrst
main
theorem.
This
step
essentially
amounts
to
showing
that
any
θ
as
in
Corollary
13.4
necessarily
factors
through
ΠXK
.
The
proof
of
this
next
step
is
the
main
topic
of
the
following
Section.
Note
that
if
this
fact
(i.e.,
that
θ
factors
through
ΠXK
)
could
be
proven
more
directly,
then
this
paper
could
be
simpliﬁed
considerably.
(For
instance,
Section
11,
as
well
as
the
rather
technical
notions
of
“irreducibly
splittable”
and
“F
I-geometric”
would
be
unnecessary.)
Unfortunately,
however,
the
proof
of
this
fact
in
Section
14
relies
heavily
on
the
“preservation
of
relations”
(Corollary
13.4).
Section
14:
The
Annihilation
of
Inertia
In
this
Section,
we
prove
that
any
continuous
surjective
homomorphism
θ
:
ΠUK
→
ΠYK
over
ΓK
necessarily
(acts
as
though
it)
factors
through
ΠXK
.
In
the
process
of
doing
this,
we
complete
the
proof
of
the
(ﬁrst
part
of)
the
ﬁrst
main
theorem
of
this
paper,
in
the
case
where
the
base
ﬁeld
is
a
local
ﬁeld.
Throughout
most
of
this
Section
(except
for
the
very
end
–
i.e.,
from
the
statement
of
Theorem
14.1
on),
we
continue
to
use
the
notation
of
the
preceding
three
Sections.
Let
us
assume,
moreover,
that
YK
is
not
hyperelliptic.
Thus,
it
follows
(e.g.,
from
Lemma
10.4
(3))
that
any
connected
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
YK
is
also
non-hyperelliptic.
Let
us
ﬁrst
consider
the
morphism

→
F
∧
H
0
(Y,
ωY
/OK
)
⊗OK
O
∞
K
69
constructed
in
Section
12.
We
would
like
to
show
ﬁrst
of
all
that
F
F

⊆
F
∧
,
where
F
F
def
⊗O
K
O
(∗)FX
This
morphism
factors
through
FX
∞
X
=
K
0
H
(X,
ωX/OK
)
(cf.
the
discussion
preceding
Proposition
11.3).
To
do
this,
we
argue
as
follows:
Let
x
∈
XK
(K).
Let
∧

x
:
F∞
→
O
K
be
the
morphism
induced
by
restriction:
i.e.,
elements
of
F∞
are
sections
of
L[∞],
hence
diﬀerentials
on
X[∞];
thus,
by
taking
the
residue
of
such
a
diﬀerential
at
x,
we
get
a
residue
map
F∞
→
OK
;
then
taking
the
p-adic
completion
of
this
residue
map
gives
us
x
.
We
would
like
to
show
in
the
following
that
the
restriction

ζx
:
H
0
(Y,
ωY
/OK
)
→
O
K
of
x
to
H
0
(Y,
ωY
/OK
)
is
zero.
If
we
show
this,
then
this
will
be
also
hold
for
all
x
∈
F
XK
(K

)
(where
K

is
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
K),
hence
(∗)FX
will
follow
immediately
(from
F
consists
precisely
of
all
those
diﬀerentials
whose
residues
at
every
point
the
fact
that
FX
are
zero).
Thus,
let
us
assume
that
ζx
=
0.
Let
Ix
⊆
ΔU
denote
the
inertia
group
(well-deﬁned
up
to
conjugation)
corresponding
to
x.
Then
observe
that
the
restriction
Ix
⊆
ΔU
→
ΔY
of
θ
to
ΔU
is
nontrivial.
Indeed,
if
this
restriction
were
zero,
then
it
is
clear
from
the
way
that
ζx
was
constructed
(cf.
the
“comparison
theorem”
of
Proposition
11.3)
that
ζx
would
be
zero.
Thus,
θ(Ix
)
=
{1}.
In
particular,
it
follows
(by
possibly
enlarging
K)
that
there
exists
an
open
normal
subgroup
ΠY

⊆
ΠYK
(corresponding
to
a
covering
YK
→
YK
)
such
K

that:
(i)
ΠY

surjects
onto
ΓK
;
and
(ii)
if
we
let
UK
→
UK
be
the
result
of
pulling
back
K


YK
→
YK
via
θ,
then
UK
→
UK
is
a
connected
Galois
covering
which
is
ramiﬁed
over
x.
def

Let
G
=
ΠYK
/ΠY

.
Thus,
G
is
a
ﬁnite
group,
and
G
=
Gal(UK
/UK
)
=
Gal(YK
/YK
).
K


Note
that
UK
→
UK
extends
to
a
ramiﬁed
covering
XK
→
XK
.
Let
x
∈
XK
(K)
(where
we
enlarge
K
if
necessary)
be
a
point
lying
above
x.


Now
let
us
denote
with
primes
the
objects
corresponding
to
UK
,
XK
,
and
YK
that
are
analogous
to
the
objects
already
constructed
for
UK
,
XK
,
and
YK
.
Thus,
we
have


∧

x
:
(F∞
)
→
OK
and

ζx

:
H
0
(Y

,
ωY

/OK
)
→
O
K
70
Note
that
the
fact
that
ζx
=
0
implies
(since
ζx

|H
0
(Y,ωY
/OK
)
=
ζx
)
that
ζx

=
0.
Let
σ
∈
G
be
such
that
σ(x
)
=
x
,
σ
=
1.
Then
the
fact
that
σ
ﬁxes
x
implies
that
σ
ﬁxes
x
,

∧
)
is
G-equivariant)
which,
in
turn,
implies
(since
the
inclusion
H
0
(Y

,
ωY

/OK
)
→
(F∞

that
σ
ﬁxes
ζx
.
On
the
other
hand,
by
Corollary
13.4
(“preservation
of
relations”)
and
the
fact
def

that
YK
is
not
hyperelliptic,
it
follows
that
the
point
of
the
projective
space
PK
=
0




P(H
(Y
,
ωY

/OK
))
deﬁned
by
ζx
lies
on
the
canonically
embedded
curve
YK
⊆
PK
.

Thus,
the
fact
that
ζ

is
ﬁxed
by
σ
implies
that
Y

admits
a
K-valued
point
which
is
ﬁxed
x
K
by
σ.
Since
YK
→
YK
=
YK
/G
is
étale,
however,
this
is
absurd.
This
contradiction
thus
F
completes
the
proof
that
ζx
=
0,
and
hence
also
the
proof
of
(∗)FX
.
Let
us
review
what
we
have
done
so
far.
Given
a
surjective
continuous
homomorphism
θ
:
ΠUK
→
ΠYK
over
ΓK
,
we
have
seen
that
θ
induces
an
injection
H
0
(YK
,
ωYK
/K
)
→
H
0
(XK
,
ωXK
/K
)
that
preserves
relations.
Thus,
it
follows
(by
using
the
canonical
embedding
of
YK
)
that
we
get
a
dominant
morphism
θU
:
UK
→
YK
which
extends
to
a
morphism
θX
:
XK
→
YK
by
properness.
Moreover,
given
any
ﬁnite
Galois
étale
covering
YK
→
YK
whose
geometric

part
has
p-power
order,
we
can
pull-back
this
covering
via
θ
to
obtain
UK
→
UK
(ﬁnite


étale),
XK
→
XK
(ﬁnite
and
possibly
ramiﬁed),
together
with
θ
:
ΠU

→
ΠY

.
If
K
K
we
then
repeat
the
argument
just
applied
to
θ
for
θ
,
we
see
that
we
get
a
morphism



θX
If
we
then
continue
this
procedure
for
arbitrary

:
XK
→
YK
which
lies
over
θX
.
ﬁnite
Galois
étale
coverings
(whose
geometric
parts
have
p-power
order),
the
well-known
correspondence
between
fundamental
groups
and
categories
of
étale
coverings
thus
shows
that
the
morphism
induced
by
θU
on
fundamental
groups
coincides
with
θ
up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
induced
by
an
element
of
ΠYK
.
On
the
other
hand,
since
both
θ
and
the
morphism
induced
by
θU
on
fundamental
groups
have
the
property
that
they
lie
over
ΓK
,
it
follows
that
the
element
of
ΠYK
in
question
must
map
to
the
the
center
of
ΓK
.
Since,
however,
ΓK
is
center-free
(see
Lemma
15.6
below
–
one
checks
easily
that
there
are
no
“vicious
circles”
in
the
reasoning),
it
follows
that
the
element
in
question
must
therefore
be
an
element
of
ΔY
⊆
ΠYK
.
That
is
to
say,
we
have
essentially
proven
the
following
result:
Theorem
14.1.
Let
K
be
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
.
Let
YK
be
a
hyperbolic
curve
(not
necessarily
proper)
over
K.
Let
UK
be
the
spectrum
of
a
one-dimensional
function
ﬁeld
over
K.
Let
Homdom
K
(UK
,
YK
)
be
the
set
of
dominant
K-morphisms
from
UK
to
YK
.
Let
(Π
,
Π
Homopen
UK
YK
)
be
the
set
of
open,
continuous
group
homomorphisms
ΠUK
→
ΠYK
ΓK
over
ΓK
,
considered
up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
arising
from
ΔY
.
Then
the
natural
map
71
open
Homdom
K
(UK
,
YK
)
→
HomΓK
(ΠUK
,
ΠYK
)
is
bijective.
Proof.
We
begin
by
proving
that
this
map
is
injective.
First,
observe
that
by
replacing
UK
and
YK
by
coverings
deﬁned
by
“p-derivates”
(as
in
Deﬁnition
0.2)
of
ΔU
and
ΔY
(where
we
use
p-derivates
since
they
are
natural),
we
may
assume
that
both
UK
and
YK
admit
hyperbolic
compactiﬁcations
U
K
and
Y
K
(i.e.,
U
K
and
Y
K
are
proper
hyperbolic
curves
over
K).
Since
dominant
K-morphisms
UK
→
YK
are
the
same
as
dominant
K-morphisms
U
K
→
Y
K
,
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
such
a
morphism
U
K
→
Y
K
is
determined
by
its
induced
morphism
Δab
→
Δab
(on
abelianizations
of
geometric
fundamental
groups).
But
U
Y
this
follows
from
the
fact
that
this
morphism
Δab
→
Δab
clearly
determines
the
morphism
U
Y
between
all
p-power
torsion
points
of
the
Jacobians
of
U
K
and
Y
K
,
hence
it
determines
the
induced
morphism
between
the
Jacobians
of
U
K
and
Y
K
.
Moreover,
since
U
K
and
Y
K
are
both
proper
hyperbolic
(i.e.,
of
genus
≥
2),
they
both
embed
in
their
Jacobians,
so
we
conclude
that
the
original
morphism
U
K
→
Y
K
is
uniquely
determined,
as
desired.
Next,
we
consider
surjectivity.
Let
us
ﬁrst
consider
the
case
where
YK
is
proper.
By
replacing
UK
by
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
UK
(and
then
descending
at
the
end,
which
is
possible
since
(by
the
preceding
paragraph)
the
natural
map
in
the
Theorem
is
injective),
we
can
assume
that
the
proper
model
XK
of
UK
is
hyperbolic.
Note,
moreover,
that
if
θ
:
ΠUK
→
ΠYK
is
open,
then
its
image
is
of
ﬁnite
index,
so
by
replacing
YK
by
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
YK
,
it
is
clear
that
we
may
assume
that
θ
is
surjective.
Finally,
by
Lemma
10.4
(4),
by
replacing
YK
by
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
YK
,
it
is
clear
that
we
may
assume
that
YK
is
non-hyperelliptic.
Now
we
are
in
the
circumstances
considered
above,
and
so
we
see
that
θ
arises
from
a
geometric
morphism
UK
→
YK
,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
Theorem
when
YK
is
proper.
Now
let
us
consider
the
case
when
YK
is
not
proper.
First
note
that
by
replacing
YK
by
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
YK
,
we
may
assume
that
the
compactiﬁcation
ZK
of
YK
is
hyperbolic.
Now
the
point
is
to
compose
the
given
θ
:
ΠUK
→
ΠYK
with
the
morphism
ΠYK
→
ΠZK
arising
from
the
compactiﬁcation
inclusion
YK
⊆
ZK
.
Since
we
know
the
Theorem
to
be
true
for
morphisms
between
UK
and
ZK
,
we
thus
obtain
that
ΠUK
→
ΠZK
arises
from
some
dominant
UK
→
ZK
(which
necessarily
factors
–
since
UK
is
the
spectrum
of
a
ﬁeld
–
through
YK
,
thus
yielding
a
UK
→
YK
).
Thus
it
remains
only
to
see
that
the
morphism
induced
on
π1
’s
by
this
UK
→
YK
is
the
same
as
the
given
θ.
But
this
is
done
(as
usual)
by
considering
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
YK
→
YK
,
and
applying
the
argument
just


described
to
UK
and
YK
to
obtain
a
UK
→
YK
which
lies
over
the
UK
→
YK
constructed
previously.
As
usual,
this
is
enough
to
show
(cf.
the
argument
directly
preceding
the
statement
of
Theorem
14.1)
that
the
morphism
induced
on
fundamental
groups
by
the
UK
→
YK
that
we
constructed
is
the
same
as
the
given
θ.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
Theorem.
In
fact,
we
have
the
following:
72
Corollary
14.2.
Let
K
be
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
.
Let
XK
(respectively,
YK
)
be
either
a
hyperbolic
curve
(not
necessarily
proper!)
over
K
or
the
spectrum
of
a
one-dimensional
function
ﬁeld
over
K.
Let
Homdom
K
(XK
,
YK
)
be
the
set
of
dominant
K-morphisms
from
XK
to
YK
.
Let
Homopen
(Π
,
Π
XK
YK
)
be
the
set
of
open,
continuous
group
homomorphisms
ΓK
ΠXK
→
ΠYK
over
ΓK
,
considered
up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
arising
from
ΔY
.
Then
the
natural
map
open
Homdom
K
(XK
,
YK
)
→
HomΓK
(ΠXK
,
ΠYK
)
is
bijective.
Proof.
By
an
argument
analogous
to
that
of
the
ﬁnal
paragraph
of
the
proof
of
Theorem
14.1,
it
follows
that
it
suﬃces
to
consider
the
case
where
YK
is
a
hyperbolic
curve.
If
UK
is
the
generic
point
(considered
as
a
scheme)
of
XK
,
then
given
any
open
θX
:
ΠXK
→
ΠYK
,
composing
θX
with
the
natural
surjection
ΠUK
→
ΠXK
induced
by
UK
→
XK
gives
us
an
open
θU
:
ΠUK
→
ΠYK
.
Applying
Theorem
14.1
to
θU
thus
gives
us
a
dominant
morphism
XK
→
Y
K
(where
Y
K
is
the
compactiﬁcation
of
the
curve
YK
).
To
see
that
this
morphism
factors
through
YK
,
it
suﬃces
to
apply
this
construction
to
YK
→
YK
,
where
YK
is
a
ﬁnite,
geometrically
connected
(over
K),
Galois
étale
covering
(of
p-power
order)
of
YK
which
is
ramiﬁed
over
all
the
points
of
Y
K
−
YK
.
In
fact,
we
may
even
choose
YK
so
that
the
ramiﬁcation
indices
over
all
the
points
of
Y
K
−
YK
are
larger
than
the
degree
of
XK
over



Y
K
.
Then
the
fact
that
we
get
some
XK
→
Y
K
(where
XK
is
étale
over
XK
)
lying
over
the
morphism
XK
→
Y
K
obtained
previously
shows
that
this
morphism
XK
→
Y
K
factors
through
YK
,
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
Corollary.
Remark.
Corollary
14.2
is
thus
a
special
case
of
Theorem
A,
the
ﬁrst
main
theorem
of
this
paper.
In
fact,
Corollary
14.2
holds
even
in
the
case
where
K
is
only
ﬁnitely
generated
over
Qp
.
However,
unlike
the
situation
in
[Mzk2],
deriving
this
ﬁnitely
generated
case
from
the
local
ﬁeld
case
is
not
so
trivial,
again
(cf.
the
discussion
at
the
end
of
Section
13)
because
of
the
fact
that
ΔU
is
so
large.
Thus,
we
save
the
derivation
of
the
ﬁnitely
generated
case
for
the
following
Section.
Section
15:
Base
Fields
Finitely
Generated
over
the
p-adics
In
this
Section,
we
let
L
be
a
ﬁnitely
generated
extension
of
Qp
.
We
would
like
to
prove
versions
of
Theorem
14.1
and
Corollary
14.2
in
the
case
where
the
base
ﬁeld
is
L
(as
opposed
to
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
).
Thus,
by
induction
on
the
transcendence
degree
of
L
over
Qp
,
we
may
assume
that
Theorem
14.1,
for
instance,
is
known
for
all
base
ﬁelds
whose
transcendence
degree
over
Qp
is
<
that
of
L.
Let
XL
and
YL
be
proper
hyperbolic
curves
over
L.
Let
UL
be
the
generic
point
of
XL
(regarded
as
a
scheme).
Moreover,
let
us
assume
that
we
have
been
given
a
continuous
surjective
homomorphism
over
ΓL
73
θ
:
ΠUL
→
ΠYL
Once
it
is
shown
that
θ
factors
though
ΠXL
,
it
is
relatively
easy
to
derive
that
θ
arises
geometrically
from
Theorem
14.1.
Thus,
the
ﬁrst
order
of
business
is
to
show
that
θ
factors
through
ΠXL
.
To
achieve
this,
we
assume
that
this
is
not
the
case.
Then
(cf.
the
argument
employed
in
Section
14)
by
replacing
YL
and
UL
by
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
YL
→
YL
and
UL
→
UL
(the
latter
obtained
by
pulling
back
the
former
via
θ),
we
may
assume
that
we
are
in
the
following
situation:
There
is
a
ﬁnite
cyclic
group
G
(with
generator
σ)
acting
faithfully
on
UL
(hence
also
XL
)
and
YL
–
via
L-linear
automorphisms
–
in
such
a
way
that
σ
ﬁxes
a
point
x0
∈
XL
(L),
but
acts
without
ﬁxed
points
on
YL
.
Moreover,
we
assume
that
σ
◦
θ
◦
σ
−1
coincides
with
θ
up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
deﬁned
by
an
element
of
ΔY
.
If
we
can
show
that
these
assumptions
lead
to
a
contradiction,
it
will
follow
immediately
that
θ
factors
through
ΠXL
.
Let
(as
usual)
HU
(respectively,
HY
)
be
the
abelianization
of
ΔU
(respectively,
ΔY
)
regarded
as
a
ΓK
-module.
Let
HUP
⊆
HU
be
the
closure
of
the
image
of
all
the
inertia
groups
(cf.
the
beginning
of
Section
11).
Note
that
θ
induces
a
ΓK
-morphism
HU
→
HY
.
Since
HY
is
a
ﬁnitely
generated
Zp
-module,
it
follows
that
(by
possibly
replacing
L
by
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
L)
there
exist
points
x1
,
.
.
.
,
xr
∈
XL
(L)
such
that
the
images
of
the
corresponding
inertia
groups
θ(Ii
)
(for
i
=
1,
.
.
.
,
r)
in
HY
is
equal
to
the
image
of
θ(HUP
)
in
HY
.
Now
let
K
⊆
L
be
a
subﬁeld
such
that
L
is
a
one-dimensional
function
ﬁeld
over
K
(hence,
in
particular,
we
assume
that
K
is
algebraically
closed
in
L).
Note
that
such
a
K
always
exists
(as
long
as
L
is
not
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
).
Thus,
there
exists
a
smooth
aﬃne
model
M
→
Spec(K)
of
L
such
that
XL
and
YL
extend
to
smooth
curves
XM
→
M
and
YM
→
M
over
M.
Moreover,
we
may
also
assume
(by
shrinking
M)
that
x1
,
.
.
.
,
xr
extend
to
sections
s1
,
.
.
.
,
sr
:
XM
→
M
whose
images
are
disjoint
from
one
another,
and
that
σ
acts
on
XM
and
YM
.
The
point
x0
∈
XL
(L)
then
extends
(by
the
valuative
criterion
for
properness)
to
a
section
s0
:
M
→
XM
.
Finally,
let
us
observe
that
(by
further
shrinking
M),
we
may
assume
that
σ
acts
without
ﬁxed
points
on
YM
.
The
ﬁrst
thing
that
we
would
like
to
get
our
hands
on
is
a
morphism
like
θ,
except
for
objects
over
K,
so
that
we
can
apply
Theorem
14.1
over
K
(which
we
know
to
be
true
via
the
induction
hypothesis).
To
construct
such
a
morphism,
we
argue
as
follows.
Let
m
∈
M(K)
be
a
point
(which,
after
possibly
enlarging
K,
always
exists).
Let
D
be
the
spectrum
of
the
completion
of
OM,m.
(Here,
one
should
think
of
the
“D”
as
standing
for
“disk.”)
Thus,
we
may
choose
an
isomorphism
D
∼
=
Spec(K[[t]])
(where
t
is
an
indeterminate).
Let
D∞
→
D
1
be
the
ramiﬁed
covering
of
inﬁnite
degree
obtained
by
adjoining
all
t
N
(for
N
a
positive
integer)
to
OD
.
Let
p
∈
XM
be
the
prime
which
is
the
ﬁber
Xm
of
XM
→
M
over
M.
Let
UD
be
the
spectrum
of
the
completion
of
OXM
,p
.
Thus,
UD
is
the
spectrum
of
a
complete
discrete
valuation
ring
with
residue
ﬁeld
equal
to
K(Um
),
the
function
ﬁeld
of
Xm
.
Let
ηD
def
(respectively,
ηD∞
)
be
the
generic
point
of
D
(respectively,
D∞
).
Let
UηD
=
UD
×D
ηD
.
Thus,
UηD
is
the
spectrum
of
a
complete,
discretely
valued
ﬁeld.
In
particular,
it
follows
74
from
the
well-known
theory
of
such
ﬁelds
(see,
e.g.,
[Ser2])
that
if
ΓUηD
is
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
this
ﬁeld,
then
we
have
an
exact
sequence

1
→
Z(1)
→
ΓUηD
→
ΓK(Um
)
→
1

Here
the
covering
corresponding
to
the
Z(1)
is
given
by
adjoining
all
t
N
(for
N
a
positive
integer)
–
cf.
the
covering
D∞
→
D.
1
Now
let
us
denote
by
ΠUη
the
result
of
replacing
the
geometric
portion
(i.e.,
relative
D
to
the
morphism
UηD
→
ηD
)
of
the
fundamental
group
of
UηD
by
its
maximal
pro-p
quotient.
Then
we
get
an
exact
sequence
1
→
ΔUm
→
ΠUη
D
→
ΓηD
→
1
If
we
pull
this
exact
sequence
back
via
ΓηD∞
=
ΓK
→
ΓηD
,
we
thus
get
an
exact
sequence
1
→
ΔUm
→
ΠUη
D∞
→
ΓηD∞
=
ΓK
→
1
Moreover,
it
is
easy
to
see
that
this
last
exact
sequence
can
be
identiﬁed
with
1
→
ΔUm
→
ΠUm
→
ΓK
→
1
On
the
other
hand,
if
we
pull
back
ΠYL
→
ΓL
via
ΓK
=
ΓηD∞
→
ΓL
,
we
get
an
exact
sequence
1
→
ΔYm
→
ΠYm
→
ΓK
→
1
Thus,
if
we
pull-back
θ
via
ΓK
=
ΓηD∞
→
ΓL
to
obtain
a
morphism
ΠUη
D∞
→
ΠYη
D∞
(where
the
subscripted
ηD∞
denotes
“⊗L
ηD∞
”)
and
compose
with
“π1
”
of
the
natural
morphism
UηD∞
→
UηD∞
,
we
get
a
continuous
homomorphism
θm
:
ΠUm
→
ΠYm
over
ΓK
(where
K
we
regard
here
as
the
residue
ﬁeld
of
M
at
m).
Lemma
15.1.
The
morphism
θm
is
surjective.
Proof.
It
suﬃces
to
show
that
the
restriction
of
θm
to
ΔUm
surjects
onto
ΔYm
=
ΔY
.
In
fact,
by
the
basic
theory
of
p-groups,
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
θm
induces
a
surjection
of
ΔUm
onto
HYm
=
HY
.
To
see
this,
it
suﬃces
to
consider
(after
replacing
M
by
a
ﬁnite
75
étale
covering
of
M,
and
enlarging
K
if
necessary)
a
ﬁnite
abelian
covering
YL
→
YL
(where
YL
→
L
is
geometrically
connected)
of
degree
a
power
of
p
which
is
>
1.
Let
us
pull-back
this
covering
to
some
covering
UL
→
UL
via
θ.
Then
we
must
show
that
the
pull-back
Uη
D∞
→
UηD∞
of
this
covering
to
UηD∞
is
not
the
trivial
covering.
Thus,

suppose
that
it
is
the
trivial
covering.
Then
the
covering
Um
→
Um
that
it
induces
(cf.
the
exact
sequences
above)
of
Um
is
again
trivial.
Since
the
images
of
s1
,
.
.
.
,
sr
in
Xm
are
disjoint
this
implies
ﬁrst
of
all
that
UL
→
UL
is
unramiﬁed
at
x1
,
.
.
.
,
xr
.
But
because
of
the
way
in
which
x1
,
.
.
.
,
xr
were
chosen,
this
implies
that
the
covering
YL
→
YL
was
obtained
from
a
quotient
of
HY
/Im(θ(HUP
)).
Thus,
it
follows
that
UL
→
UL
extends
to
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
XL
→
XL
.
Moreover,
since
XM
is
smooth
over
M
at
m,
it
follows


that
XL
→
XL
is
split
if
and
only
if
the
induced
Xm
→
Xm
is
split.
But
this
Xm
→
Xm

extends
the
covering
Um
→
Um
which
we
already
saw
to
be
trivial.
Thus,
we
obtain
that
XL
→
XL
,
hence
UL
→
UL
is
trivial.
Since
θ
is
surjective,
however,
this
implies
that
YL
→
YL
is
trivial.
This
contradiction
completes
the
proof
of
the
Lemma.
Now
by
the
induction
hypothesis
on
the
transcendence
degree
of
L,
it
follows
that
θm
arises
from
some
geometric
morphism
Um
→
Ym
which
is
compatible
with
the
action
of
σ
on
both
sides
(since
σ
is
compatible
with
θ).
By
the
valuative
criterion
for
properness,
this
morphism
extends
to
a
morphism
Xm
→
Ym
.
Moreover,
σ
ﬁxes
s0
(m)
∈
Xm
(K),
so
s0
(m)
∈
Xm
(K)
is
mapped
to
a
ﬁxed
point
of
Ym
(K),
which
is
absurd,
since
σ
acts
on
Ym
without
ﬁxed
points.
This
contradiction
completes
the
proof
of
the
following
result:
Lemma
15.2.
Let
L
be
a
ﬁnitely
generated
extension
of
Qp
.
Let
XL
and
YL
be
proper
hyperbolic
curves
over
L.
Let
UL
be
the
generic
point
of
XL
.
Then
any
continuous
surjective
homomorphism
θ
:
ΠUL
→
ΠYL
over
ΓL
necessarily
factors
through
ΠXL
.
Now
we
can
conclude
that
θ
arises
geometrically,
as
follows.
Consider
the
M-scheme
def
HM
=
HomM
(XM
,
YM
)
→
M.
Since
YM
is
hyperbolic,
it
is
well-known
that
HM
is
ﬁnite
and
unramiﬁed
over
M.
(Indeed,
that
HM
→
M
is
unramiﬁed
(respectively,
quasiﬁnite;
proper)
follows
since
the
pull-back
of
the
tangent
bundle
of
Ym
to
Xm
(for
any
m
∈
M)
has
no
global
sections
(respectively,
follows
from
the
Hurwitz
formula,
which
allows
one
to
bound
the
degree
of
a
morphism
Xm
→
Ym
;
follows
via
the
same
argument
as
that
used
in
Lemma
8.3
of
[Mzk1]).)
By
shrinking
M,
we
may
assume
that
HM
is
ﬁnite
étale
over
M.
Then
the
fact
that
θm
arises
geometrically
(from
some
Xm
→
Ym
)
shows
that
over
some
ﬁnite
extension
L
of
L,
we
have
a
morphism
XL
→
YL
that
specializes
to
Xm
→
Ym
.
Moreover,
if
M

is
the
normalization
of
M
in
L
,
then
since
the
pro-p
geometric
fundamental
groups
of
XM

and
YM

form
local
systems
over
M

,
it
follows
(by
checking
what
happens
over
the
point
m)
that
the
morphism
on
Δ’s
induced
by
XL
→
YL
is
the
same
(up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism)
as
that
induced
by
θ.
In
particular,
the
morphism
HX
→
HY
induced
by
XL
→
YL
is
the
same
as
that
induced
by
θ.
On
the
other
hand,
a
morphism
from
XL
to
YL
(over
any
ﬁeld)
is
determined
by
the
morphism
it
induces
from
HX
to
HY
(cf.
the
proof
of
the
injectivity
part
of
Theorem
14.1).
Thus,
since
the
HX
→
HY
in
question
is
ΓL
-
(not
just
ΓL
-)
equivariant,
we
obtain
76
that
XL
→
YL
descends
to
a
XL
→
YL
.
By
repeating
this
construction
(as
usual)
for
all
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
YL
,
we
also
obtain
that
the
morphism
induced
on
fundamental
groups
by
this
XL
→
YL
is
the
original
θ.
That
is
to
say,
in
summary,
we
have
proven
that
any
θ
:
ΠUL
→
ΠYL
as
in
Lemma
15.2
necessarily
arises
geometrically
from
some
morphism
UL
→
YL
.
Thus,
by
arguments
formally
analogous
to
those
of
the
proofs
of
Theorem
14.1
and
Corollary
14.2,
we
obtain
the
following
analogue
of
Corollary
14.2:
Corollary
15.3.
Let
K
be
a
ﬁnitely
generated
ﬁeld
extension
of
Qp
.
Let
XK
(respectively,
YK
)
be
either
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
K
or
the
spectrum
of
a
one-dimensional
function
ﬁeld
over
K.
Let
Homdom
K
(XK
,
YK
)
be
the
set
of
dominant
K-morphisms
from
XK
to
YK
.
Let
Homopen
(Π
,
Π
XK
YK
)
be
the
set
of
open,
continuous
group
homomorphisms
ΓK
ΠXK
→
ΠYK
over
ΓK
,
considered
up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
arising
from
ΔY
.
Then
the
natural
map
open
Homdom
K
(XK
,
YK
)
→
HomΓK
(ΠXK
,
ΠYK
)
is
bijective.
It
turns
out
that
it
is
most
natural
to
generalize
Corollary
15.3
to
the
case
where
the
long
and
unwieldy
expression
“hyperbolic
curve/spectrum
of
a
one-dimensional
function
ﬁeld
deﬁned
over
a
ﬁnitely
generated
ﬁeld
extension
of
Qp
”
is
replaced
by
the
much
shorter
expression
“pro-hyperbolic
curve
over
a
sub-p-adic
ﬁeld.”
Thus,
we
make
the
following
deﬁnition:
Let
K
be
a
ﬁeld.
Let
XK
be
a
K-scheme.
Deﬁnition
15.4.
(i)
We
shall
call
a
ﬁeld
K
a
sub-p-adic
ﬁeld
if
there
exists
a
prime
number
p,
together
with
a
ﬁnitely
generated
ﬁeld
extension
L
of
Qp
such
that
K
is
isomorphic
to
a
subﬁeld
of
L.
(ii)
We
shall
call
XK
a
hyperbolic
pro-curve
(over
K)
if
XK
can
be
written
as
the
projective
limit
of
a
projective
system
of
hyperbolic
curves
over
K
such
that
all
the
transition
morphisms
in
the
projective
system
are
birational.
Thus,
the
following
are
all
examples
of
sub-p-adic
ﬁelds:
(1)
ﬁnitely
generated
(in
particular,
ﬁnite)
extensions
of
Qp
(2)
number
ﬁelds
(i.e.,
ﬁnite
extensions
of
Q)
(3)
the
subﬁeld
of
Q
which
is
the
composite
of
all
number
ﬁelds
of
degree
≤
n
over
Q
(for
some
ﬁxed
integer
n).
77
Another
way
to
think
of
a
pro-hyperbolic
curve
XK
is
as
the
result
of
removing
some
set
(possibly
inﬁnite,
possibly
empty)
of
closed
points
from
some
hyperbolic
curve.
In
particular,
the
notion
of
a
“hyperbolic
pro-curve”
generalizes
both
the
notion
of
a
hyperbolic
curve
and
the
case
of
the
spectrum
of
a
function
ﬁeld
of
dimension
one.
Then
we
have
the
following
result:
Corollary
15.5.
Let
K
be
sub-p-adic.
Let
XK
(respectively,
YK
)
be
a
hyperbolic
pro-curve
over
K.
Let
Homdom
K
(XK
,
YK
)
be
the
set
of
dominant
K-morphisms
from
XK
open
to
YK
.
Let
HomΓK
(ΠXK
,
ΠYK
)
be
the
set
of
open,
continuous
group
homomorphisms
ΠXK
→
ΠYK
over
ΓK
,
considered
up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
arising
from
ΔY
.
Then
the
natural
map
open
Homdom
K
(XK
,
YK
)
→
HomΓK
(ΠXK
,
ΠYK
)
is
bijective.
Proof.
First,
let
us
observe
that
if
K
is
a
ﬁnitely
generated
ﬁeld
extension
of
Qp
,
then
Corollary
15.5
follows
immediately
from
Corollary
15.3
by
arguments
formally
analogous
to
those
of
the
proofs
of
Theorem
14.1
and
Corollary
14.2.
Thus,
the
only
(slightly)
“new”
phenomenon
here
is
the
fact
that
we
allow
K
to
be
a
subﬁeld
of
a
ﬁnitely
generated
extension
of
Qp
.
The
argument
for
such
subﬁelds
is
as
follows:
Let
K
be
a
subﬁeld
of
a
ﬁnitely
generated
extension
ﬁeld
L
of
Qp
.
Suppose
that
we
have
been
given
XK
and
YK
as
in
the
statement
of
Corollary
15.5,
as
well
as
an
open
θ
:
ΠXK
→
ΠYK
over
ΓK
.
Let
us
denote
by
θgeom
the
morphism
ΔX
→
ΔY
induced
by
θ
on
geometric
fundamental
groups.
By
base-changing
to
L
and
applying
the
Corollary
15.5
over
L,
we
obtain
that
there
exists
a
morphism
φL
:
XL
→
YL
whose
induced
morphism
on
geometric
fundamental
groups
coincides
with
that
deﬁned
by
θ.
On
the
other
hand,
since
morphisms
between
hyperbolic
curves
(hence
also
hyperbolic
pro-curves),
clearly
have
no
moduli
(cf.
the
fact
that
the
scheme
HM
of
the
discussion
preceding
Corollary
15.3
was
ﬁnite
and
unramiﬁed
over
M),
it
follows
that
φL
descends
to
a
ﬁnite
Galois
extension
K

of
K.
Thus,
we
have
a
morphism
φK

:
XK

→
YK

.
It
remains
to
descend
φK

to
K.
But
this
follows
from
the
fact
that
if
σ
∈
Gal(K

/K),
then
conjugating
φK

by
σ
gives
a
morphism
φσK

:
XK

→
YK

whose
induced
morphism
on
geometric
fundamental
groups
is
the
result
of
conjugating
θgeom
by
σ.
On
the
other
hand,
θgeom
arises
from
θ
which
lies
over
ΓK
,
so
θgeom
is
ﬁxed
(up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
deﬁned
by
an
element
of
ΔY
)
by
conjugation
by
σ.
Thus,
φK

and
φσK

induce
the
same
morphism
on
geometric
fundamental
groups,
hence
coincide
(cf.
the
argument
of
the
discussion
preceding
Corollary
15.3).
This
shows
that
φK

descends
to
a
morphism
φK
:
XK
→
YK
.
Repeating
this
construction
(as
usual
–
cf.
the
argument
preceding
the
statement
of
Theorem
14.1)
for
coverings
of
XK
and
YK
shows
that
the
morphism
induced
by
φK
on
fundamental
groups
coincides
with
θ
(up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
deﬁned
by
an
element
of
ΔY
).
Remark.
Note
that
in
Corollaries
15.3
and
15.5,
in
fact,
we
implicitly
used
the
fact
that
78
for
K
as
in
those
Corollaries,
ΓK
is
center-free.
This
may
be
proven
as
follows.
First,
if
K
is
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
,
then
we
have
the
following:
Lemma
15.6.
If
K
is
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
,
then
the
group
ΓK
is
center-free.
Proof.
(The
argument
given
here
is
“well-known,”
but
was
related
to
the
author
by
A.
Tamagawa.)
Since
one
knows
explicitly
(see,
e.g.,
[Ser2],
Chapter
IV,
§2)
the
structure
of
Gal(K
tm
/K),
it
is
clear
that
the
quotient
Gal(K
tm
/K)
of
ΓK
is
center-free.
Thus,
the
center
of
ΓK
must
lie
in
ΓK
tm
⊆
ΓK
.
On
the
other
hand,
ΓK
tm
is
a
pro-p
group.
Moreover,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
facts
that
(1)
H
2
(K,
Fp
(1))
=
Fp
;
(2)
if
K

is
a
ﬁnite
unramiﬁed
extension
of
K
of
degree
p
(which
always
exists),
then
the
natural
morphism
H
2
(K,
Fp
(1))
→
H
2
(K

,
Fp
(1))
is
zero;
that
H
2
(ΓK
tm
,
Fp
)
=
0.
But
by
[Shatz],
Chapter
III,
§3,
Proposition
2.3,
this
is
enough
to
imply
that
ΓK
tm
is
free
(as
a
pro-p
group),
which
implies
that
its
center
is
trivial
(see,
e.g.,
[Tama],
§1,
Propositions
1.1,
1.11).
Next,
we
consider
the
case
of
a
ﬁnitely
generated
extension
of
Qp
:
Lemma
15.7.
Suppose
that
K0
is
a
ﬁeld
of
characteristic
zero
with
the
property
that
every
open
subgroup
of
ΓK0
is
center-free.
Then
any
ﬁnitely
generated
ﬁeld
extension
K
of
K0
also
has
this
property.
In
particular,
if
K
is
a
ﬁnitely
generated
ﬁeld
extension
of
Qp
,
then
ΓK
is
center-free.
Proof.
The
last
statement
follows
from
the
ﬁrst
plus
Lemma
15.6.
Thus,
let
us
prove
the
ﬁrst
statement.
Note
that
an
extension
of
a
center-free
group
by
a
center-free
group
is
center-free.
Thus,
it
suﬃces
to
prove
that
if
L
is
a
function
ﬁeld
(of
arbitrary
ﬁnite
dimension)
over
K
0
,
then
ΓL
is
center-free.
Next,
note
that
the
projective
limit
of
a
projective
system
of
center-free
groups
in
which
all
the
transition
morphisms
are
surjective
is
center-free.
Moreover,
as
is
well-known,
Spec(L)
is
a
projective
limit
of
“hyperbolic
Artin
neighborhoods”
over
K
0
(i.e.,
successive
ﬁbrations
of
hyperbolic
curves
–
see
[SGA4],
XI
3.3).
Thus,
it
suﬃces
to
prove
that
the
fundamental
group
of
such
an
Artin
neighborhood
is
center-free.
But
this
then
reduces
to
showing
that
the
fundamental
group
of
a
hyperbolic
curve
is
center-free,
which
is
well-known
(see,
e.g.,
[Tama],
§1,
Proposition
1.11).
This
is
already
enough
for
Corollary
15.3.
Now
we
can
conclude
the
result
for
arbitrary
K
as
in
Corollary
15.5
by
means
of
the
following
Lemma
(due
to
A.
Tamagawa):
79
Lemma
15.8.
Let
K
be
sub-p-adic.
Then
ΓK
is
center-free.
Proof.
Let
K

be
a
ﬁnitely
generated
ﬁeld
extension
of
Qp
that
contains
K.
Suppose
that
σ
∈
ΓK
lies
in
the
center
of
ΓK
,
but
is
not
equal
to
the
identity.
Then
there
exists
a
ﬁnite
Galois
extension
L
of
K
such
that
σ
maps
to
an
element
of
Gal(L/K)
other
than
the
identity.
Write
L
=
K(α),
for
some
α
∈
L.
Let
EL
be
an
elliptic
curve
over
L
with
j-invariant
α.
Let
XL
be
the
complement
of
“0”
in
EL
.
Thus,
XL
is
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
L.
Let
YL
be
the
result
of
base-changing
XL
by
σ
:
L
→
L.
Thus,
it
follows
that
XL
and
YL
are
isomorphic
as
schemes
over
K.
Moreover,
conjugating
by
σ
deﬁnes
an
isomorphism
ΠXL
∼
=
ΠYL
which
lies
over
ΓL
because
σ
is
in
the
center
of
ΓK
.
Basechanging
this
isomorphism
to
L
(the
composite
of
K

and
L
over
K),
we
get
a
ΓL
isomorphism
ΠXL
∼
=
ΠYL
.
By
Corollary
15.3
(in
fact,
really,
this
follows
already
from
the
results
of
[Mzk2]),
we
obtain
that
this
isomorphism
arises
from
an
L
-isomorphism
of
XL
with
YL
.
But
this
implies
that
the
j-invariants
of
the
compactifying
elliptic
curves
of
XL
and
YL
are
the
same,
i.e.,
that
α
=
ασ
∈
L
⊆
L
,
which
is
absurd.
This
contradiction
completes
the
proof
of
the
Lemma.
Section
16:
Maps
From
Higher-Dimensional
Function
Fields
to
Curves
Let
K
be
sub-p-adic
(cf.
Deﬁnition
15.4
(i)).
Let
UK
be
the
spectrum
of
a
function
ﬁeld
over
K.
(Note
that
here,
we
do
not
assume
that
the
dimension
of
the
function
ﬁeld
is
one.)
Let
XK
be
a
smooth
projective
model
of
UK
(which
exists
by
[Hiro]).
Thus,
UK
is
the
generic
point
of
XK
.
Let
n
be
the
dimension
of
XK
.
By
abuse
of
terminology,
we
shall
also
say
that
n
is
the
“dimension
of
UK
over
K.”
Since
the
one-dimensional
case
has
been
dealt
with
previously,
we
assume
here
that
n
≥
2.
The
purpose
of
this
Section
is
to
prove
a
result
like
Corollary
15.5,
except
for
morphisms
between
UK
and
a
hyperbolic
pro-curve.
Let
L
be
a
very
ample
line
bundle
on
XK
.
Let
def
V
=
Γ(XK
,
L)
Since
the
dimension
of
XK
is
≥
2,
and
L
is
very
ample,
it
follows
that
dimK
(V
)
≥
3.
Let
W

⊆
V
be
a
one-dimensional
(over
K)
subspace,
generated
by
a
section
of
L
whose
zero
locus
forms
a
smooth,
connected
subvariety
of
XK
.
(Note
that
by
Bertini’s
theorem
(see,
e.g.,
Theorem
6.3,
pp.
66,
of
[Jou]),
it
is
well-known
that
such
a
W

exists.)
Let
W
⊆
V
be
a
two-dimensional
subspace
containing
W

.
Choose
a
basis
{e1
,
e2
}
for
W
such
that
e1
∈
W

.
Let
e3
∈
V
be
an
element
whose
image
in
V
/W
is
nonzero.
Let
us
also
assume
that
the
common
zero
locus
in
XK
of
the
three
sections
e1
,
e2
,
e3
is
a
subscheme
of
XK
of
codimension
≥
3.
(This
can
always
be
achieved
by
choosing
e1
,
e2
,
e3
suﬃciently
def
def
generically.)
Let
K

=
K(t)
(where
t
is
an
indeterminate).
Let
s1
=
t;
s2
=
t−1
.
Then
we
def
can
construct
a
new
two-dimensional
subspace
W
⊆
VK

=
V
⊗K
K

,
over
K

,
as
follows:
80
def

We
let
W
be
the
subspace

by
the
vectors

e1
=
e1
+
s1
·
e3
,

e2
=
e2
+
s2
·
e3
.
Thus,
to
summarize,
we
have
the
following
situation:
W

Lemma
16.1.
Let
Ω
be
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
containing
K

.
Then
there
do
not
def
exist
any
one-dimensional
subspaces
W

of
WΩ
=
W
⊗K

Ω
such
that
W

is
deﬁned
(as
a
subspace
of
V
⊗K
Ω)
over
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
K.
Proof.
Indeed,
if
such
a
W

existed,
then
there
would
exist
elements
a,
b,
c
∈
Ω
(with
c
=
0,
and
at
least
one
of
a,
b
nonzero),
together
with
α1
,
α2
,
α3
∈
K
such
that
a·
e1
+
b
·
e2
=
c
·
(α1
·
e1
+
α2
·
e2
+
α3
·
e3
)
By
dividing
a
and
b
by
c,
we
may
assume
that
c
=
1.
Then,
equating
the
coeﬃcients
of
e1
,
e2
,
e3
,
we
obtain
that
a
=
α1
;
b
=
α2
;
s1
·
a
+
s2
·
b
=
α3
.
But
this
implies
that
t,
t−1
,
and
1
(as
elements
of
K

)
are
linearly
dependent
over
K,
which
is
absurd.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
Lemma.
Before
proceeding,
let
us
pause
to
interpret
what
this
Lemma
means.
Note
that
the
3-dimensional
K-subspace
of
V
generated
by
e1
,
e2
,
e3
deﬁnes
a
rational
morphism
ψ
from
def
XK
to
QK
=
P(K
·
e1
+
K
·
e2
+
K
·
e3
).
Thus,
ψ
is
deﬁned
outside
of
some
closed
subscheme
of
XK
of
codimension
≥
2.
Moreover,
note
that
the
inverse
image
via
ψ
of
any
closed
point
of
QK
is
a
subscheme
of
XK
of
codimension
≥
2.
(Indeed,
this
follows
from
the
fact
that
the
common
zero
locus
of
e1
,
e2
,
e3
has
codimension
≥
3
in
XK
.)
Now
let
Ω
be
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
K

,
and
let
us
consider
a
one-dimensional
(over
Ω)
subspace
W

def
of
WΩ
.
Thus,
W

corresponds
to
a
line
LΩ
⊆
QΩ
=
QK
⊗K
Ω,
and
the
zero
locus
(in
−1
XΩ
=
XK
⊗K
Ω)
of
a
nonzero
section
of
W

is
equal
to
the
closure
of
ψΩ
(LΩ
)
⊆
XΩ
.
def
Now
we
are
ready
to
interpret
Lemma
16.1:
Namely,
I
claim
that
Lemma
16.1
implies
−1
(LΩ
)
is
deﬁned
over
K.
that
no
irreducible
component
of
the
(closure
of
the)
divisor
ψΩ
81
Indeed,
if
there
were
a
divisor
D
⊆
XK
such
that
ψΩ
(DΩ
)
⊆
LΩ
,
then
by
spreading
out
Ω
(respectively,
LΩ
)
to
a
smooth
aﬃne
curve
CK
over
K
(respectively,
a
family
of
lines
in
QK
parametrized
by
CK
),
we
obtain
that
for
every
closed
point
c
∈
CK
,
we
have
ψ(D)
⊆
Lc
.
But
since
(by
Lemma
16.1)
LΩ
is
not
deﬁned
over
K,
it
follows
that
for
two
suﬃciently
generic
closed
points
c,
c
∈
CK
,
dimK
(Lc
Lc
)
=
0,
which
implies
that
D
is
contained
in
the
inverse
image
of
a
ﬁnite
set
of
closed
points
of
QK
.
But
we
saw
in
the
preceding
paragraph
that
the
inverse
image
via
ψ
of
a
closed
point
of
QK
is
of
codimension
≥
2.
Since
D
is
a
divisor,
this
is
absurd.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
claim
stated
at
the
beginning
of
this
paragraph.
Next,
let
us
base-change
UK
and
XK
to
K

:
this
gives
rise
to
UK

and
XK

.
The
def
two-dimensional
subspace
W
⊆
VK

deﬁnes
a
rational
map
from
XK

to
PK

=
P(W
).
Let

XK

⊆
XK

be
the
complement
of
the
indeterminacy
locus
of
this
rational
map.
Thus,
the

complement
of
XK

in
XK

is
of
codimension
≥
2,
and,
moreover,
we
obtain
a
dominant
morphism
(a
“pencil”)

ξ
:
XK

→
PK

Let
ηP
be
the
generic
point
of
PK

.
Let
ηP
be
the
spectrum
of
an
algebraic
closure
of
K(ηP
)
(the
function
ﬁeld
of
PK

).
Let
def
FηP
⊆
XηP
=
XK
×K
ηP
be
the
divisor
which
is
the
zero
locus
of
the
section
of
L
⊗K
K(ηP
)
deﬁned
by
the
generic
point
ηP
of
PK

.
(Thus,
FηP
→
ηP
is
proper.)
Put
another
way,
FηP
is
the
(closure
in
XηP
of
the)
ﬁber
(⊆
Xη
P
⊆
XηP
)
of
the
morphism
ξ
over
the
generic
point
ηP
∈
PK

(whence
the
use
of
the
letter
“F
”).
Since
the
pencil
PK

contains

e1
,
which
is
a
genericization
of
e1
(i.e.,
e1
is
the
specialization
of
e1
at
s1
=
t
=
0),
and
the
zero
locus
of
e1
is
(geometrically)
smooth
and
connected,
it
follows
that
FηP
will
also
be
geometrically
smooth
and
connected
over
ηP
.
Moreover,
by
the
Lefshetz
hyperplane
theorem
(see,
e.g.,
[SGA2]),
it
follows
(since
dimK
(XK
)
≥
2)
that
the
natural
morphism
π1
(FηP
)
→
π1
(XηP
)
=
π1
(XK

)
=
π1
(XK
)
is
surjective.
Let
def
GηP
=
FηP
×XηP
UηP
=
FηP
×XK
UK
Since
UK
is
a
projective
limit
of
dense
open
subschemes
of
XK
,
it
thus
follows
that
GηP
is
a
projective
limit
of
open
subschemes
of
FηP
.
Moreover,
since
FηP
(thought
of
as
(the
closure
of)
the
ﬁber
of
the
dominant
morphism
ξ
over
the
generic
point
ηP
of
PK

)
contains
(as
a
dense
open
subset)
a
scheme
which
is
a
projective
limit
of
dense
open
subschemes
of
XK

,
we
conclude
that
GηP
is
an
integral,
nonempty
scheme.
82
At
any
rate,
we
get
a
natural
morphism
π1
(GηP
)
→
π1
(UηP
)
=
π1
(UK

)
=
π1
(UK
)
Now
we
have
the
following
important
Lemma
16.2.
This
morphism
π1
(GηP
)
→
π1
(UK
)
is
surjective.

→
U
(of
degree
>
1),
Proof.
It
suﬃces
to
take
a
ﬁnite,
connected
étale
covering
U
K
K

pull
it
back
to
a
covering
GηP
→
GηP
over
GηP
,
and
show
that
this
pulled
back
covering
η
→
Gη
is
split.
Now
observe
that
since
ξ
is
can
never
be
split.
Indeed,
suppose
that
G
P
P
dominant,
it
follows
that
FηP
→
XK

and
GηP
→
UK

are
dominant.
In
fact,
FηP
→
XK

and
GηP
→
UK

are
even
birational
isomorphisms.
Moreover,
I
claim
that
the
divisors
(in
XK

)
that
were
thrown
out
of
XK

to
create
FηP
–
let
us
call
these
divisors
F
-divisors
–
are
diﬀerent
from
the
divisors
that
were
thrown
out
of
XK

to
create
UK

–
which
we
shall
call
U-divisors.
Indeed,
as
divisors
of
XK

=
XK
⊗K
K

,
the
U-divisors
are
all
deﬁned
over
ﬁnite
extensions
of
K,
whereas
the
F
-divisors
(which
are
just
ﬁbers
of
ξ
over
closed
points
of
PK

)
are,
by
Lemma
16.1
(see
also
the
interpretation
of
Lemma
16.1
in
the
two
paragraphs
following
the
proof
of
Lemma
16.1),
never
deﬁned
over
ﬁnite
extensions
of
K.
This
proves
the
claim.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
the
morphism
FηP
→
FηP
is
ramiﬁed
only
over
F
-divisors.
Thus,
it
is
unramiﬁed
over
U-divisors.
Since
GηP
→
FηP
is
birational,
the
fact
that
η
→
Gη
splits
(hence,
in
particular,
extends
to
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
over
Fη
)
thus
G
P
P
P

→
U
arises

→
U
is
unramiﬁed
over
the
U-divisors,
i.e.,
U
implies
that
the
original
U
K
K
K
K

→
X
.
(Here
we
use
“purity
of
the
branch
locus”
for
regular
local
from
a
covering
X
K
K
rings
–
see,
e.g.,
[SGA2],
Exposé
X,
p.
118,
Théorème
3.4.)
But
then
the
fact
that
the
pull-back
FηP
→
FηP
of
this
covering
to
FηP
does
not
split
follows
from
the
surjectivity
observed
immediately
before
the
statement
of
this
Lemma.
Thus,
since
GηP
→
FηP
is
η
→
Gη
cannot
split
either.
This
contradiction
completes
birational,
it
follows
that
G
P
P
the
proof
of
the
Lemma.
Now
let
us
assume
that
we
are
given
a
surjective
continuous
homomorphism
over
ΓK
θ
:
ΠUK
→
ΠYK
def
where
YK
is
a
proper
hyperbolic
curve
over
K.
Let
YηP
=
YK
×K
ηP
.
Thus,
YηP
is
a
proper
hyperbolic
curve
over
ηP
.
Suppose,
moreover,
that
we
know
that
morphisms
like
θ
necessarily
arise
geometrically
(i.e.,
from
a
dominant
morphism
UK
→
YK
)
for
UK
of
dimension
<
n.
(We
shall
refer
to
this
assumption
as
the
“Induction
Hypothesis.”
83
Note
that
by
Corollary
15.5,
we
already
know
that
this
induction
hypothesis
is
true
for
dimK
(UK
)
=
1.)
Then
the
morphism
ΠGη
→
ΠYK
P
obtained
by
composing
(“π1
of”)
the
natural
morphism
GηP
→
UK
with
θ
lies
over
ΓηP
→
ΓK
,
and
by
Lemma
16.2,
is
such
that
it
induces
a
surjection
between
the
(maximal
prop
quotients
of
the)
respective
geometric
fundamental
groups.
Moreover,
this
morphism
naturally
deﬁnes
a
morphism
θG
:
ΠGη
→
ΠYη
P
P
(since
ΠYη
is
the
ﬁbered
product
of
ΠYK
and
ΓηP
over
ΓK
).
Thus,
to
summarize,
θG
is
P
a
surjective
continuous
homomorphism
over
ΓηP
.
Let
UηGP
be
the
generic
point
of
GηP
.
Thus,
by
composing
(“π1
of”)
UηGP
→
GηP
with
θG
,
we
obtain
a
continuous
surjective
homomorphism
θU
G
:
ΠUηG
→
ΠYη
P
P
over
ηP
.
Moreover,
the
dimension
of
UηGP
over
ηP
is
<
n.
Thus,
by
the
induction
hypothesis,
it
follows
that
θU
G
arises
geometrically,
from
some
unique
dominant
morphism
UηGP
→
YηP
.
Projecting
to
YK

then
gives
a
dominant
morphism
UηGP
→
YK

.
We
would
like
to
observe
that
this
morphism
UηGP
→
YK

extends
to
UK

.
Indeed,
to
see
this,
observe
that
UηGP
and
UK

are
both
projective
limits
of
open
subsets
of
the
projective
K

-variety
XK

.
Moreover,
UK

can
be
written
as
the
projective
limit
of
K

smooth
open
subsets
of
XK

.
Thus,
the
fact
that
we
get
a
morphism
UK

→
YK

follows
from
the
following
Lemma
16.3.
Let
L
be
a
ﬁeld;
YL
be
a
proper,
smooth,
geometrically
connected
curve
of
nonzero
genus
over
L;
and
ZL
be
a
smooth
L-variety.
Suppose
that
we
have
a
rational
map
φ
from
ZL
to
YL
.
Then
φ
is
deﬁned
over
all
of
ZL
.
Proof.
This
Lemma
is
a
well-known
consequence
of
the
classical
theory
of
the
Albanese
variety
(see,
e.g.,
[Lang]):
Namely,
let
UL
⊆
ZL
be
a
(nonempty)
open
over
which
φ
is
deﬁned.
Assume
(without
loss
of
generality)
that
YL
(L)
=
∅.
Let
AL
be
the
Jacobian
of
YL
,
and
let
BL
be
its
dual.
Then
a
point
of
YL
(L)
deﬁnes
an
embedding
YL
→
AL
which
we
can
compose
with
φ
to
obtain
a
rational
map
φA
from
ZL
to
AL
.
It
suﬃces
to
show
84
that
φA
extends
to
a
morphism
on
ZL
.
But
note
that
the
portion
of
φA
which
already
is
a
morphism
(from
UL
to
AL
)
deﬁnes
(by
pulling
back
the
Poincaré
bundle
on
AL
×L
BL
)
a
line
bundle
on
UL
×L
BL
.
Since
ZL
×L
BL
is
a
regular
scheme,
it
follows
that
this
line
bundle
extends
to
ZL
×L
BL
.
Then
taking
the
classifying
morphism
associated
to
this
extended
line
bundle
gives
a
morphism
ZL
→
AL
,
as
desired.
Let
us
review
what
we
have
done
so
far.
We
started
with
a
continuous
surjective
homomorphism
θ
:
ΠUK
→
ΠYK
over
ΓK
.
Moreover,
we
have
shown
that
if
we
base-change
θ
from
K
to
K

to
obtain
θK

:
ΠUK

→
ΠYK

then
θK

arises
geometrically
from
some
dominant
UK

→
YK

.
Note,
moreover,
that
this
morphism
UK

→
YK

is
the
unique
morphism
that
gives
rise
to
(the
geometric
portion
of)
θ.
(This
follows,
for
instance,
from
the
inductive
hypothesis
on
n.
Moreover,
this
uniqueness
also
holds,
of
course,
over
any
ﬁnite
extension
of
K

.)
Thus,
if
we
specialize
the
indeterminate
t
∈
K

to
some
element
of
a
ﬁnite
extension
L
of
K
that
is
suﬃciently
generic
so
that
UK

→
YK

specializes
to
UL
→
YL
,
and
then
base-change
this
UL
→
YL
back
up
to
a
morphism
UL
→
YL
(where
L
is
the
composite
of
K

and
L),
then
this
morphism
UL
→
YL
coincides
with
the
morphism
obtained
by
base-changing
the
original
UK

→
YK

via
K

⊆
L
.
But
this
means
that
the
original
UK

→
YK

is,
in
fact,
deﬁned
over
L.
Finally,
since
K

and
L
are
linearly
disjoint
over
K,
it
follows
that
the
original
UK

→
YK

is
deﬁned
over
K.
Thus,
we
get
a
morphism
UK
→
YK
which
clearly
induces
the
original
θ
(since,
for
instance,
ΠUK

→
ΠUK
is
surjective).
Let
us
step
back
now
and
take
stock
of
what
we
have
done
so
far
in
this
Section.
We
started
with
UK
,
the
spectrum
of
a
function
ﬁeld
over
K,
and
a
proper
hyperbolic
curve
YK
over
K.
Then
given
any
surjective
continuous
homomorphism
θ
:
ΠUK
→
ΠYK
over
ΓK
,
we
showed
that
θ
necessarily
arises
geometrically.
Now
let
us
pause
for
a
deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition
16.4.
Let
QK
be
a
K-scheme.
We
shall
call
QK
a
smooth
pro-variety
if
it
is
the
projective
limit
of
a
projective
system
of
smooth
(geometrically
connected)
varieties
over
K
such
that
the
transition
morphisms
are
all
birational.
Now
Lemma
16.3,
plus
the
techniques
of
the
proofs
of
Theorem
14.1
and
Corollary
14.2
show
that
we
have,
in
fact,
proven
the
following
(our
ﬁrst
main
theorem
–
Theorem
A
in
the
Introduction):
85
Theorem
16.5.
Let
K
be
sub-p-adic
(cf.
Deﬁnition
15.4
(i)).
Let
XK
(respectively,
YK
)
be
a
smooth
pro-variety
(respectively,
hyperbolic
pro-curve)
over
K.
Let
Homdom
K
(XK
,
YK
)
open
the
set
of
dominant
K-morphisms
from
XK
to
YK
.
Let
HomΓK
(ΠXK
,
ΠYK
)
be
the
set
of
open,
continuous
group
homomorphisms
ΠXK
→
ΠYK
over
ΓK
,
considered
up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
arising
from
ΔY
.
Then
the
natural
map
open
Homdom
K
(XK
,
YK
)
→
HomΓK
(ΠXK
,
ΠYK
)
is
bijective.
Remark.
Finally,
we
make
the
following
important
observation:
Note
that
given
any
pro-p
result
such
as
Theorem
16.5,
one
can
always
immediately
derive
a
corresponding
proﬁnite
result
from
it.
(Here
by
“corresponding
proﬁnite
result,”
we
mean
the
same
result,
except
that
“Π”
(respectively,
“Δ”)
is
replaced
by
“Πprf
”
(respectively,
“Δprf
”).)
Indeed,
suppose
that
K,
XK
,
and
YK
are
as
in
the
statement
of
Theorem
16.5,
and
let
prf
θ
:
Πprf
XK
=
π1
(XK
)
→
ΠYK
=
π1
(YK
)
be
an
open
homomorphism
over
ΓK
.
Then
note
that
θ
immediately
induces
an
open
homomorphism
θp
:
ΠXK
→
ΠYK
.
Applying
Theorem
16.5
shows
that
θp
arises
from
some
φ
:
XK
→
YK
.
Thus,
it
remains
only
to
show
that
the
morphism
induced
by
φ
on
fundamental
groups
coincides
with
θ.
But
this
follows
from
the
argument
preceding
Theorem
14.1:
namely,
we
consider
an
arbitrary
ﬁnite
étale
covering
YK
→
YK
.
Pulling

this
covering
back
via
θ
gives
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
XK
→
XK
.
Moreover,
θ
induces
a

morphism
between
the
full
proﬁnite
fundamental
groups
of
XK
and
YK
.
Next,
observe
that

this
morphism
gives
us
a
φ
:
XK
→
YK
(by
the
same
argument
as
that
used
to
construct
φ
from
θ)
which
(by
naturality
of
the
constructions
involved)
lies
over
φ.
Thus,
if
we
continue
this
procedure
for
arbitrary
ﬁnite
étale
coverings,
the
well-known
correspondence
between
fundamental
groups
and
categories
of
étale
coverings
shows
that
the
morphism
induced
by
φ
on
fundamental

θ
up

an

This
completes
the
proof
of
the
“proﬁnite
analogue
of
Theorem
16.5.”

Function
Fields
Let
K
be
sub-p-adic
(cf.
Deﬁnition
15.4
(i)).
Let
L
and
M
be
function
ﬁelds
(of
arbitrary
dimension)
over
K.
(Thus,
in
particular,
we
assume
here
that
K
is
algebraically
closed
in
L
and
M).
We
denote
by
ΓL
and
ΓM
the
absolute
Galois
groups
of
L
and
86
M,
respectively.
In
this
Section,
we
would
like
to
show
how
to
derive
a
result
(Theorem
17.1,
which
is
stated
as
Theorem
B
in
the
Introduction)
like
Theorem
16.5
for
morphisms
between
L
and
M
(over
K).
Theorem
17.1.
Let
K
be
sub-p-adic
(cf.
Deﬁnition
15.4
(i)).
Let
L
and
M
be
function
ﬁelds
of
arbitrary
dimension
over
K.
Let
HomK
(Spec(L),
Spec(M))
be
the
set
of
K-morphisms
from
M
to
L.
Let
Homopen
ΓK
(ΓL
,
ΓM
)
be
the
set
of
open,
continuous
group
homomorphisms
ΓL
→
ΓM
over
ΓK
,
considered
up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
arising
from
Ker(ΓM
→
ΓK
).
Then
the
natural
map
HomK
(Spec(L),
Spec(M))
→
Homopen
ΓK
(ΓL
,
ΓM
)
is
bijective.
Proof.
First,
recall
(cf.
the
Remark
following
Theorem
16.5)
that
any
pro-p
result
such
as
Theorem
16.5
always
implies
a
corresponding
proﬁnite
result.
Now
we
use
induction
on
the
transcendence
degree
–
which
we
shall
henceforth
denote
by
dimK
(M)
–
of
M
over
K.
When
dimK
(M)
=
0,
the
result
is
vacuous.
When
dimK
(M)
=
1,
the
result
follows
from
the
proﬁnite
version
of
Theorem
16.5;
thus,
we
may
assume
that
dimK
(M)
>
1.
Now
suppose
that
we
know
Theorem
17.1
to
be
true
for
maps
to
functions
ﬁelds
of
transcendence
degree
<
dimK
(M).
Suppose
that
we
are
given
an
open
continuous
homomorphism
θ
:
ΓL
→
ΓM
over
ΓK
.
Observe
that
just
as
previously
(e.g.,
in
the
proof
of
Theorem
14.1),
we
can
assume
without
loss
of
generality
that
θ
is
surjective.
Next,
observe
that
there
exists
a
function
ﬁeld
P
⊆
M
such
that
0
<
dimK
(P
)
<
dimK
(M).
Moreover,
we
may
assume
that
P
is
algebraically
closed
in
M.
Thus,
we
get
a
surjection
ΓM
→
ΓP
.
Composing
θ
with
this
surjection,
we
obtain
a
surjection
θP
:
ΓL
→
ΓP
,
which,
by
the
induction
hypothesis
on
dimK
(M),
we
know
arises
geometrically
from
some
P
→
L
(over
K).
Moreover,
since
θP
is
surjective,
it
follows
that
P
is
algebraically
closed
in
L.
Thus,
we
may
regard
L
and
M
as
function
ﬁelds
over
P
.
Moreover,
dimP
(M)
<
dimK
(M).
Thus,
since
θ
:
ΓL
→
ΓM
is
(by
the
deﬁnition
of
θP
)
a
morphism
over
ΓP
,
it
follows
from
the
induction
hypothesis
on
dimK
(M)
that
θ
arises
from
some
M
→
L
over
P
(hence
also
over
K).
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
Theorem.
Remark.
Note
that
in
this
case,
we
needed
to
work
with
proﬁnite
(not
pro-p)
fundamental
groups
because
the
operation
of
taking
the
maximal
pro-p
quotient
is
not
well-behaved
with
respect
to
ﬁbrations:
i.e.,
if
we
had
replaced
Ker(ΓM
→
ΓK
)
with
its
maximal
pro-p
quotient,
we
would
run
into
trouble
because
it
is
not
clear
that
the
maximal
pro-p
quotient
of
Ker(ΓM
→
ΓP
)
injects
into
the
maximal
pro-p
quotient
of
Ker(ΓM
→
ΓK
).
87
Also,
we
needed
to
work
with
function
ﬁelds
(as
opposed
to
varieties)
because,
if,
for
instance,
Spec(L)
and
Spec(P
)
had
been
varieties,
the
fact
that
the
geometric
(over
K)
fundamental
group
of
Spec(L)
surjects
onto
that
of
Spec(P
)
does
not
necessarily
imply
that
the
morphism
Spec(L)
→
Spec(P
)
has
geometrically
connected
ﬁbers.
Moreover,
if
the
generic
geometric
ﬁber
of
Spec(L)
→
Spec(P
)
has
several
distinct
connected
components,
it
is
not
necessarily
the
case
that
the
fundamental
group
of
any
of
these
connected
components
surjects
onto
the
geometric
(over
P
)
fundamental
group
of
Spec(M).
Indeed,
by
replacing
Spec(M)
by
a
smooth
projective
variety
YK
(of
dimension
≥
3),
and
Spec(L)
by
the
result
–
call
it
XK
–
of
cutting
this
variety
with
a
generic
hyperplane
section,
then
the
inclusion
XK
→
YK
induces
an
isomorphism
on
geometric
fundamental
groups
despite
the
fact
that
XK
is
not
isomorphic
to
YK
.
Moreover,
note
that
such
a
counterexample
to
a
“variety
version”
of
Theorem
17.1
exists
even
if
YK
is
“hyperbolic”
(say,
a
product
of
proper
hyperbolic
curves),
in
which
case,
one
would
expect
XK
(at
least
if
the
ample
line
bundle
used
to
cut
YK
to
form
XK
has
suﬃciently
high
degree)
to
be
“quite
hyperbolic,”
as
well.

If
Δ
is
a

let
us
introduce
the

notation:
Δ{0}

Δ{i}
=
[Δ{i−1},
Δ{i−1}].
Also,
let
us
write
“Πi
”
(respectively,
“Δi
”)
for
Π/Δ{i}
(respectively,
Δ/Δ{i}).
The
purpose
of
this
Section
is
to
observe
that
much
of
the
theory
of
this
paper
continues
to
hold
to
a
large
extent
even
when
we
consider
morphisms
not
between
the
full
Π’s,
but
between
certain
truncated
versions
of
the
Π’s.
Our
ﬁrst
main
result
is
the
following:
Theorem
18.1.
Let
K
be
sub-p-adic
(cf.
Deﬁnition
15.4
(i)).
Let
XK
be
a
smooth
variety
over
K.
Let
YK
be
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
K.
Let
n
≥
5.
Then
every
continuous
open
homomorphism
θ
:
ΠnXK
→
ΠnYK
over
ΓK
induces
a
dominant
morphism
μ
:
XK
→
YK
whose
induced
morphism
on
fundamental
groups
coincides
(up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
arising
from
n−3
ΔYK
)
with
the
morphism
Δn−3
XK
→
ΔYK
deﬁned
by
considering
θ
“modulo
Δ{n
−
3}.”
Proof.
First
let
us
consider
the
case
where:
(i)
K
is
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
;
(ii)
XK
is
a
curve;
(iii)
YK
is
a
non-hyperelliptic
proper
hyperbolic
curve;
(iv)
n
=
3.
Then
note
that
the
theory
of
Sections
1
through
5
manifestly
only
involves
Δ2XK
.
It
thus
follows
immediately
(via
the
help
of
a
technical
lemma
–
Lemma
18.4
below
–
necessary
in
order
to
assure
that
Lemma
7.3
goes
through
in
the
truncated
context)
that
to
prove
Proposition
7.4,
we
really
only
used
Δ2Yη
.
Thus,
in
summary,
as
long
as
the
covering
YηS
→
YηS
(in
S
88
the
notation
of
the
discussion
preceding
Proposition
7.4)
arises
from
an
open
subgroup
of
Π1YK
,
we
can
apply
Proposition
7.4
to
YηS
to
conclude
that
YηS
admits
a
line
bundle
of
degree
prime
to
p.
Now
we
would
like
to
conclude
the
“preservation
of
relations.”
Note
that
Section
11
manifestly
only
involves
the
abelianization
of
the
geometric
fundamental
group.
Moreover,
Section
12
is
just
formal
manipulation.
In
Section
13,
the
only
thing
from
Sections
1
through
7
that
is
used
is
Proposition
7.4
(whose
applicability
under
the
present
circumstances
was
discussed
in
the
preceding
paragraph).
Thus,
by
using
Propositions
7.4
and
8.1,
Lemma
8.2,
and
the
theory
of
Section
9,
we
may
conclude
“preservation
of
relations”
for
the
morphism
H
0
(YK
,
ωYK
/K
)
→
H
0
(XK
,
ωXK
/K
)
induced
by
Δ1XK
→
Δ1YK
.
(Note,
however,
that
this
time,
in
the
application
of
Section
9,
we
take
for
our
tower
of
coverings
“XLn
”
not
the
coverings
corresponding
to
the
p-derivates
of
the
whole
geometric
fundamental
group
Δ,
but
rather
the
p-derivates
of
Δ1
–
which
is
enough
to
carry
out
the
argument
of
Section
9.)
Hence
we
get
a
morphism
μ
:
XK
→
YK
.
Now
let
us
lift
the
hypothesis
that
n
=
3.
Then
we
obtain
the
following:
If
YK
→
YK

is
a
covering
arising
from
an
open
subgroup
of
Πn−3
YK
,
and
XK
→
XK
is
a
connected
component
of
the
pull-back
of
this
covering
to
XK
via
θ,
then
we
get
a
natural
morphism

μ
:
XK
→
YK
.
Moreover,
the
naturality
of
the
construction
of
this
morphism
means
that
it
always
lies
over
the
morphism
XK
→
YK
.
Thus,
it
follows
by
the
usual
argument
(i.e.,
the
one
preceding
Theorem
14.1)
that
the
morphism
induced
by
μ
on
fundamental
groups
is
equal
to
θ
modulo
Δ{n
−
3}
(up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
arising
from
ΔYK
).
So
far
we
have
not
used
that
n
≥
5.
(In
fact,
we
have
only
used
that
n
≥
3.)
The
purpose
of
assuming
that
n
≥
5
is
to
lift
hypothesis
(iii)
(in
the
ﬁrst
paragraph
of
this
proof).
Namely,
given
any
hyperbolic
curve
YK
,
it
is
elementary
to
show
that
there
always
exists
a
covering
YK
→
YK
deﬁned
by
an
open
subgroup
of
Π2YK
such
that
the


compactiﬁcation
Y
K
of
YK
is
hyperbolic
and
non-hyperelliptic,
and
such
that
Y
K
→
Y
K
has
arbitrarily
large
(speciﬁed)
ramiﬁcation
over
all
the
points
of
Y
K
−
YK
.
Thus,
we
get
a



→
Y
K
which
descends
to
a
map
XK
→
Y
K
.
Moreover,
the
fact
that
XK
→
XK
map
XK

is
étale,
while
Y
K
→
Y
K
is
ramiﬁed
over
the
points
of
Y
K
−
YK
(with
ramiﬁcation
indices
arbitrarily
large)
implies
that
the
map
XK
→
Y
K
factors
through
YK
.
Thus,
we
get
a
map
XK
→
YK
,
as
desired.
Then
arguing
as
in
the
preceding
paragraph
completes
the
proof,
albeit
still
under
the
assumptions
(i)
and
(ii)
(of
the
ﬁrst
paragraph
of
the
proof).
The
extension
to
the
case
of
ﬁelds
K
that
are
subﬁelds
of
ﬁnitely
generated
extensions
of
Qp
then
follows
via
the
same
“specialization
argument”
as
that
employed
previously
in
the
nontruncated
case
(following
Lemma
15.2).
Thus,
we
can
also
lift
assumption
(i).
Finally,
the
“cutting
with
a
hyperplane
argument”
of
Section
16
extends
immediately
to
the
truncated
case.
This
allows
us
to
lift
assumption
(ii),
thus
completing
the
proof
of
the
Theorem.
Theorem
18.2.
Let
K
be
a
subﬁeld
of
a
ﬁnitely
generated
ﬁeld
extension
of
Qp
.
Let
XK
be
a
smooth
pro-variety
over
K.
Let
YK
be
a
hyperbolic
pro-curve
over
K.
Let
n0
be
89
the
minimum
transcendence
degree
over
Qp
of
all
ﬁnitely
generated
ﬁeld
extensions
of
Qp
that
contain
K.
Let
n0
be
the
transcendence
degree
over
K
of
the
function
ﬁeld
of
XK
.
def
Let
n0
=
n0
+
2(n0
−
1)
+
1.
Let
n
≥
3n0
+
5.
Then
every
continuous
open
homomorphism
θ
:
ΠnXK
→
ΠnYK
over
ΓK
induces
a
dominant
morphism
μ
:
XK
→
YK
whose
induced
morphism
on
fundamental
groups
coincides
(up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
arising
0
0
from
ΔYK
)
with
the
morphism
Δn−3−3n
→
Δn−3−3n
deﬁned
by
considering
θ
“modXK
YK
ulo
Δ{n
−
3
−
3n0
}.”
Proof.
The
reason
for
the
inclusion
of
the
extra
“3n0
”
(i.e.,
a
“price”
of
three
steps
for
every
additional
transcendence
degree
that
is
used,
plus
an
extra
“tax”
of
three
steps
for
allowing
the
preﬁx
“pro”)
is
the
following:
in
order
to
reduce
to
the
situation
discussed
in
the
proof
of
Theorem
18.1,
we
need
to
show
(in
the
present
“pro”
context)
that
inertia
groups
are
annihilated.
Moreover,
to
apply
the
ﬁrst
“inertia
annihilation
argument”
(at
the
beginning
of
Section
14),
we
needed
to
know
that
after
one
passes
to
some
covering
YK
→
YK
arising
from
an
open
subgroup
of
Πn−3
YK
(i.e.,
we
wish
to
apply
the
arguments
of
Theorem
18.1
for
n
−
3),
one
knows
“preservation
of
relations”
for
YK
.
Thus,
already
one
needs
some
extra
padding
–
to
the
tune
of
three
steps
(necessary,
as
we
saw
in
the
ﬁrst
two
paragraphs
of
the
proof
of
Theorem
18.1,
to
derive
“preservations
of
relations”
for
YK
).
(This
accounts
for
the
1
in
the
deﬁnition
of
n0
.)
Moreover,
each
time
one
adds
a
transcendence
degree,
one
needs
to
apply
the
“inertia
annihilation
argument”
of
the
ﬁrst
half
of
Section
15.
Thus,
by
the
same
line
of
reasoning,
one
needs
extra
padding
consisting
of
three
steps.
(This
accounts
for
the
n0
in
the
deﬁnition
of
n0
.)
In
Section
16,
one
uses
not
only
the
transcendence
degrees
inherent
in
K,
but
also
2(n0
−
1)
auxiliary
transcendence
degrees
–
here
the
“2
=
1
+
1”
comes
from
the
transcendence
degree
of
“K

”
over
“K,”
plus
the
transcendence
degree
of
the
pencil
“ξ.”
(This
accounts
for
the
2(n0
−
1)
in
the
deﬁnition
of
n0
.)
Finally,
we
remark
that
although
in
Sections
14,
15,
and
16,
we
assumed
that
the
morphism
of
fundamental
groups
“θ”
was
surjective,
it
is
easy
to
see
that
this
assumption
is
merely
cosmetic,
i.e.,
is
inessential
and
serves
only
to
simplify
the
discussion.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
Theorem.
Remark.
Thus,
the
essential
diﬀerence
between
Theorems
18.1
and
18.2
is
that
in
Theorem
18.2,
we
allow
“pro-objects,”
at
the
cost
of
having
to
apply
“annihilation
of
inertia”
arguments,
which
require
us
to
use
larger
quotients
of
ΔXK
,
ΔYK
(i.e.,
each
application
of
annihilation
of
inertia
costs
three
units
of
“n”).
Remark.
We
do
not
mean
to
pretend
that
the
estimates
in
the
above
two
Theorems
(e.g.,
the
“5’s,”
“n0
,”
etc.)
are
the
best
possible.
Especially
if
one
is
willing
to
add
hypotheses
90
to
YK
,
it
should
not
be
so
diﬃcult
to
improve
these
estimates.
The
point
of
the
above
two
Theorems
is
simply
to
illustrate
the
principle
involved.
We
conclude
this
Section
with
two
technical
lemmas
that
were
used
in
the
proofs
of
the
above
two
Theorems.
Lemma
18.3.
Let
XK
be
a
proper
hyperbolic
curve
over
a
ﬁeld
K
of
characteristic
zero.
Let
ΔX
be
(as
usual)
the
maximal
pro-p
quotient
of
its
geometric
fundamental
group.
Let
def
ΞX
=
ΔX
/[ΔX
,
[ΔX
,
ΔX
]].
Then
the
natural
morphism
H
2
(ΞX
,
Zp
(1))ΓK
→
H
2
(ΔX
,
Zp
(1))ΓK
(induced
by
the
quotient
map
ΔX
→
ΞX
)
is
surjective.
Here,
the
superscripted
“ΓK
”
denotes
“the
submodule
of
ΓK
-invariants.”
Proof.
Let
us
ﬁrst
consider
the
morphism
H
2
(ΞX
,
Zp
(1))
→
H
2
(ΔX
,
Zp
(1))
To
do
this,
we
shall
use
the
Hochschild-Serre
spectral
sequence
for
the
quotient
ΞX
→
HX
(where,
as
usual,
we
write
HX
for
the
abelianization
of
ΔX
).
Write
ΨX
⊆
ΞX
for
the
kernel
of
ΞX
→
HX
.
Thus,
ΨX
may
be
identiﬁed
with
a
certain
well-understood
(cf.
Lemma
3.1)
quotient
of
∧2
HX
.
Consideration
of
the
E2··
-term
of
this
spectral
sequence
shows
that
there
is
a
natural
ΓK
-equivariant
injection
of
the
cokernel
of
the
natural
morphism
(induced
by
the
quotient
∧2
HX
→
ΨX
)
H
1
(ΨX
,
Zp
(1))
=
HomZp
(ΨX
,
Zp
(1))
→
H
2
(HX
,
Zp
(1))
=
HomZp
(∧2
HX
,
Zp
(1))
into
H
2
(ΞX
,
Zp
(1)).
(In
other
words,
the
above
morphism
is
the
diﬀerential
(from
E20,1
to
E22,0
)
of
the
“E2pq
=
H
p
(HX
,
H
q
(ΨX
,
Zp
(1)))”-term
of
the
spectral
sequence.)
Moreover,
it
follows
from
Lemma
3.1
that
the
cokernel
of
this
natural
morphism
is
precisely
the
quotient
of
H
2
(HX
,
Zp
(1))
=
(∧2
H
1
(HX
,
Zp
))(1)
given
by
the
(surjective)
cup-product
map
(∧2
H
1
(HX
,
Zp
))(1)
→
H
2
(ΔX
,
Zp
)(1).
Thus,
in
summary,
we
have
a
ΓK
-equivariant
diagram:
H
2
(ΞX
,
Zp
(1))
⊇
Image(H
2
(HX
,
Zp
(1)))
→
H
2
(ΔX
,
Zp
(1))
in
which
the
arrow
is
bijective.
This
implies
the
assertion
stated
in
the
Lemma.
91
Lemma
18.4.
Let
K,
XK
,
ΔX
,
and
ΞX
be
as
in
Lemma
18.3.
Since
the
kernel
of
ΔX
→
ΞX
is
a
normal
subgroup
not
only
of
ΔX
,
but
also
of
ΠXK
,
write
ΠXK
→
ΠΞ
XK
for
the
quotient
of
ΠXK
by
this
subgroup.
Then
the
natural
morphisms
2
H
2
(ΠΞ
XK
,
Zp
(1))
→
H
(ΠXK
,
Zp
(1))
and
2
H
2
(ΠXK
×ΓK
ΠΞ
XK
,
Zp
(1))
→
H
(ΠXK
×ΓK
ΠXK
=
ΠXK
×K
XK
,
Zp
(1))
are
surjective.
In
particular,
if
η
∈
H
2
(ΠXK
×K
XK
,
Zp
(1))
denotes
the
ﬁrst
Chern
class
of
the
diagonal
in
XK
×K
XK
,
then
η
lies
in
the
image
of
H
2
(ΠXK
×ΓK
ΠΞ
XK
,
Zp
(1)).
Proof.
The
assertions
of
this
Lemma
follow
by
considering
the
consequences
of
the
surjectivity
assertion
of
Lemma
18.3
for
the
Hochschild-Serre
spectral
sequences
associated
Ξ
to
ΠΞ
XK

ΓK
;
ΠXK

and

Section
19:
Injectivity
Result
In
this
Section,
we
prove
the
following
“pro-p
injectivity
part
of
the
so-called
Section
Conjecture”:
Theorem
19.1.
Let
K
be
sub-p-adic
(cf.
Deﬁnition
15.4
(i)).
Let
XK
be
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
K.
Let
XK
(K)
be
the
set
of
K-valued
points
of
XK
.
Let
Sect(ΓK
,
ΠXK
)
be
the
set
of
sections
ΓK
→
ΠXK
of
ΠXK
→
ΓK
,
considered
up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
arising
from
ΔXK
.
Then
the
natural
map
XK
(K)
→
Sect(ΓK
,
ΠXK
)
is
injective.
Remark.
The
so-called
“Section
Conjecture”
states
that
(for
instance
when
XK
is
proper)
the
natural
map
in
Theorem
19.1
is
bijective.
(When
XK
is
aﬃne,
the
statement
must
be
modiﬁed
slightly.)
At
the
time
of
writing
(July
1996),
the
Section
Conjecture
has
not
yet
been
proven.
Proof.
(of
Theorem
19.1)
Let
HX
be
the
abelianization
of
ΔX
.
First,
note
that
by
replacing
XK
by
some
ﬁnite
Galois
étale
covering
of
XK
of
p-power
order,
we
may
assume
92
that
the
compactiﬁcation
X
K
of
XK
is
itself
hyperbolic
and
non-hyperelliptic.
Let
r
be
the
number
of
points
in
(X
K
−
XK
)(K).
Let
ZX
be
the
complement
of
the
diagonal
in
XK
×K
XK
.
By
taking
the
second
projection
ZX
→
XK
,
we
may
regard
ZX
as
a
family
(parametrized
by
XK
)
of
smooth
hyperbolic
curves
obtained
by
removing
r
+
1
distinct
points
from
some
compactiﬁcation.
Let
ηX
be
the
generic
point
of
XK
.
Let
ηX
be
the
spectrum
of
some
algebraic
closure
def
of
K(ηX
).
Let
ZηX
=
ZX
×X
ηX
.
Then
(since
ZX
→
XK
is
a
family
of
smooth
hyperbolic
curves
obtained
by
removing
precisely
r
+
1
distinct
points
from
some
compactiﬁcation)
we
obtain
an
exterior
Galois
representation
ρZ
:
Πprf
XK
→
Out(ΔZη
)
X
Now
I
claim
that
ρZ
factors
through
ΠXK
.
Indeed,
to
see
this,
note
that
if
HZηX
is
the
abelianization
of
ΔZη
,
then
since
ΔZη
is
a
pro-p
group,
the
kernel
of
X
X
Ξ
:
Out(ΔZη
)
→
Aut(HZη
X
)
X
is
itself
a
pro-p
group.
Thus,
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
Ξ◦ρZ
maps
Δprf
X
into
a
pro-p
subgroup
of
Aut(HZηX
).
But
now
observe
that
one
has
a
Galois-equivariant
surjection
HZηX
→
HX
whose
kernel
is
either
0
or
Zp
(1)
(depending
on
whether
r
=
0
or
r
>
0).
Moreover,
the
actions
of
Δprf
X
on
HX
and
Zp
(1)
are
trivial.
Thus,
it
follows
immediately
that
the
prf
ΔX
-action
on
HZηX
is
by
unipotent
matrices,
so
Ξ
◦
ρZ
maps
Δprf
X
into
a
pro-p
subgroup
of
Aut(MZ
),
as
desired.
This
completes
the
proof
of
the
claim.
Thus,
we
have
a
representation
ρZ
:
ΠXK
→
Out(ΔZη
)
X
Now
suppose
that
we
have
two
points
α,
β
∈
XK
(K)
that
induce
the
same
element
φ
∈
Sect(ΓK
,
ΠXK
).
Let
Zα
(respectively,
Zβ
)
be
the
pull-back
of
ZX
→
X
via
α
(respectively,
β).
Thus,
Zα
and
Zβ
are
hyperbolic
curves
over
K.
Moreover,
since
the
action
of
ΓK
on
ΔZα
(respectively,
ΔZβ
)
is
determined
by
composing
φ
with
ρZ
,
it
follows
that
there
exists
some
isomorphism
ψ
:
ΔZα
∼
=
ΔZβ
such
that
(i)
ψ
is
compatible
with
the
respective
outer
ΓK
-actions;
(ii)
ψ
preserves
and
induces
the
identity
between
the
quotients
ΔZα
→
HX
,
ΔZβ
→
HX
.
Thus,
by
Theorem
16.5
(in
fact,
really,
all
we
need
is
Theorem
A
of
[Mzk2]),
it
follows
that
ψ
arises
from
some
isomorphism
Zα
∼
=
Zβ
which
is
compatible
with
and
induces
the
identity
on
the
inclusions
Zα
→
XK
,
Zβ
→
XK
.
But
this
clearly
implies
that
α
=
β,
thus
completing
the
proof
of
the
Theorem.
Remark.
Note
that
in
fact,
in
the
proof
of
Theorem
19.1,
we
really
only
used
the
weaker
results
of
[Mzk2]
–
i.e.,
we
did
not
need
to
use
Theorem
A
of
the
present
paper.
On
the
93
other
hand,
at
the
time
that
[Mzk2]
was
written,
the
author
was
unaware
of
Theorem
19.1,
which
is
the
primary
reason
that
Theorem
19.1
did
not
appear
in
[Mzk2].
Note
also
that
although
Theorem
19.1
implies
a
corresponding
proﬁnite
result,
the
proﬁnite
result
can
be
proven
much
more
easily,
by
using
the
“Kummer
exact
sequence”
for
the
Jacobian
of
XK
.
Finally,
it
should
be
remarked
that
the
argument
employed
in
the
proof
of
Theorem
19.1
(as
well
as
the
Kummer
sequence
argument
just
mentioned)
have
been
well-known
for
some
time
(see,
e.g.,
[Naka2]).
The
main
reason
that
Theorem
19.1
was
included
in
this
paper
was
that
the
author
just
wanted
to
make
explicit
that
a
pro-p
injectivity
result
(such
as
Theorem
19.1)
could
now
be
proven.
APPENDIX:
A
Grothendieck
Conjecture-Type
Result
for
Certain
Hyperbolic
Surfaces
Section
a0:
Introduction
In
this
Appendix,
we
show
how
Theorem
A
(cf.
the
Introduction)
can
be
used
to
prove
a
Grothendieck
Conjecture-type
result
for
certain
types
of
surfaces.
The
surfaces
considered
are
families
of
(smooth)
hyperbolic
curves
that
are
parametrized
by
hyperbolic
curves
(cf.
Deﬁnition
a2.1).
We
call
such
surfaces
hyperbolically
ﬁbred.
Our
notation
is
similar
to
that
of
the
rest
of
the
paper,
except
that
since
here
we
consider
only
proﬁnite
(i.e.,
not
pro-p)
fundamental
groups,
in
this
Appendix,
we
will
write
ΠXK
for
the
proﬁnite
fundamental
group
of
XK
:
def
Notation:
If
K
is
a
ﬁeld
and
XK
is
a
K-scheme,
we
denote
by
ΠXK
=
π1
(XK
)
the
fundamental
group
of
XK
(for
some
choice
of
base-point),
and
by
ΓK
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
K.
Then
we
have
a
natural
morphism
ΠXK
→
ΓK
whose
kernel
ΔX
⊆
ΠXK
is
the
geometric
fundamental
group
π1
(XK
⊗K
K)
(where
K
is
an
algebraic
closure
of
K).
Our
main
theorem
is
the
following:
Theorem
D.
Let
K
be
sub-p-adic
(cf.
Deﬁnition
15.4
(i)).
Let
XK
and
YK
be
hyperbolically
ﬁbred
surfaces
over
K.
Let
IsomK
(XK
,
YK
)
be
the
set
of
K-isomorphisms
(in
the
category
of
K-schemes)
between
XK
and
YK
.
Let
IsomΓK
(ΠXK
,
ΠYK
)
be
the
set
of
continuous
group
isomorphisms
ΠXK
→
ΠYK
over
ΓK
,
considered
up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
arising
from
ΔY
.
Then
the
natural
map
IsomK
(XK
,
YK
)
→
IsomΓK
(ΠXK
,
ΠYK
)
94
is
bijective.
This
Theorem
is
given
as
Theorem
a2.4
in
the
text.
We
remark
that:
(1)
Theorem
D
above
is
(modulo
a
certain
technical
result
–
Lemma
a1.1)
essentially
derived
from
Theorem
A.
Note
that
one
needs
the
full
power
of
the
“Hom
version”
of
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
for
hyperbolic
curves
(i.e.,
Theorem
A)
in
order
to
prove
an
“Isom-type
result”
for
surfaces
(i.e.,
Theorem
D
above).
That
is
to
say,
the
“Isom
version”
of
Theorem
A
of
the
present
paper
–
i.e.,
Theorem
A
of
[Mzk2]
–
is
not
suﬃcient
to
prove
Theorem
D
above.
Moreover,
even
with
the
“Hom
version”
of
the
Grothendieck
Conjecture
for
hyperbolic
curves
(i.e.,
Theorem
A),
at
the
present
time,
I
am
unable
to
prove
a
“Hom
version”
of
Theorem
D.
(2)
One
might
ask
whether
Theorem
D
can
be
extended
to
hyperbolically
ﬁbered
varieties
(i.e.,
varieties
obtained
as
successive
ﬁbrations
of
hyperbolic
curves)
of
higher
dimension.
The
problem
is
that
just
as
we
needed
(see
Remark
(1))
the
“Hom
version”
in
dimension
one
to
prove
an
“Isom-type
result”
in
dimension
two,
we
would
need
a
“Hom-type
result”
in
dimension
two
–
which
is
currently
not
available
–
in
order
to
prove
an
“Isom-type
result”
in,
say,
dimension
three.
Thus,
at
the
present
time,
we
are
unable
to
advance
beyond
dimension
two.
(3)
Since
Theorem
A
is
valid
in
the
pro-p
case
as
well,
one
might
ask
why
one
cannot
prove
a
pro-p
version
of
Theorem
D
above.
The
problem
is
that
the
process
of
passing
to
the
maximal
pro-p
quotient
is
not
well-behaved

with
respect
to
ﬁbrations.
That
is
to
say,
if
XK
→
XK
is
a
family
of
hyperbolic
curves
parametrized
by
a
hyperbolic
curve
(as
in
Deﬁnition
a2.1),
then
the
maximal
pro-p
quotient
of
the
fundamental
group
of

the
geometric
generic
ﬁber
of
XK
→
XK
does
not
map
injectively
(in
general)
to
the
maximal
pro-p
quotient
of
ΔX
.
Thus,
any
attempt
to
prove
a
pro-p
version
of
Theorem
D
by
means
of
the
techniques
employed
here
would
result
in
a
rather
unnatural
theorem.
(4)
Since
Theorem
A
admits
various
truncated
versions
(cf.
the
Introduction)
as
well,
one
might
ask
why
one
cannot
prove
a
truncated
version
of
Theorem
D.
The
problem
here
is
the
same
as
the
problem
that
arises
when
one
tries
to
prove
a
pro-p
result:
i.e.,
truncating
is
not
well-behaved
with
respect
to
ﬁbrations.
(5)
To
a
slight
extent,
the
content
of
Theorem
D
above
overlaps
with
recent
results
of
H.
Nakamura
and
N.
Takao
(see
Theorem
A
and
Corollary
B
of
[NT]).

Section
a1:
A
Key
Lemma
In
this
Section,
we
prove
a
simple
technical
lemma
which
will
be
the
key
technical
ingredient
that
allows
us
to
extend
Theorem
A
to
the
case
of
surfaces.
Let
K
be
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
of
characteristic
zero.
Let
X
and
Y
be
hyperbolic
curves
over
K
(cf.
Section
0
for
a
deﬁnition
of
this
term).
Lemma
a1.1.
Let
φ
:
X
→
Y
be
a
ﬁnite
K-morphism.
Let
ψ
:
ΠXK
→
ΠYK
be
the
induced
morphism
on
fundamental
groups.
Suppose
that
Ker(ψ)
is
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated.
Then
φ
is
étale.
Proof.
By
replacing
Y
by
the
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
Y
corresponding
to
Im(ψ)
⊆
ΠYK
,
we
may
assume
that
ψ
is
surjective.
Under
this
assumption,
φ
is
étale
if
and
only
if
φ
is
an
isomorphism.
Thus,
it
suﬃces
to
assume
that:
(1)
Ker(φ)
is
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated;
and
(2)
φ
is
not
an
isomorphism
(hence
has
degree
>
1)
and
derive
a
contradiction.
def
Let
Y

→
Y
be
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
Y
,
where
Y

is
connected.
Let
X

=
X
×Y
Y

.
Then
X

→
X
is
ﬁnite
étale,
and
it
follows
from
the
assumption
that
ψ
is
surjective
that
X

is
connected.
Since
Y
is
hyperbolic,
it
follows
that
for
a
suitable
choice
of
Y

→
Y
,
Y

will
have
genus
≥
2.
Thus,
by
replacing
our
original
X
→
Y
by
X

→
Y

,
we
may
assume
that
X

and
Y

have
genus
≥
2.
Since
X
→
Y
is
assumed
to
have
degree
>
1,
it
follows
that
gX
(the
genus
of
X)
is
strictly
greater
than
gY
(the
genus
of
Y
).
Let
Y

→
Y
be
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
degree
d
such
that
Y

is
connected,
and
Y

→
Y
extends
to
an
étale
covering
over
some
compactiﬁcation
of
Y
.
Then
the
Riemann-Hurwitz
formula
implies
that,
as
Y

→
Y
varies,
gY

(which
we
think
of
as
a
function
of
d)
is
equal
to
d(gY
−
1)
+
1.
On
the
other
hand,
def
if
X

=
X
×Y
Y

,
then
(again
by
the
Riemann-Hurwitz
formula)
gX

=
d(gX
−
1)
+
1.
Thus,
it
follows
that
as
d
→
∞,
the
diﬀerence
gX

−
gY

→
∞.
Now
let
HX

denote
the
ﬁrst
homology
group
of
the
compactiﬁcation
of
X

with
coeﬃcients
in
Zp
(for
some
prime
number
p
which
will
be
ﬁxed
throughout
the
discussion).
Then
ψ
induces
a
surjection
Hψ
:
HX

→
HY

.
Thus,
Ker(Hψ
)
is
a
free
Zp
-module
of
rank
2(gX

−
gY

).
On
the
other
hand,
any
topological
generators
of
Ker(ψ)
clearly
deﬁne
a
set
of
Zp
-generators
of
Ker(Hψ
).
But
this
implies
that
rankZp
(Ker(Hψ
))
is
bounded,
independently
of
Y

→
Y
,
which
contradicts
the
fact
that
rankZp
(Ker(Hψ
))
=
2(gX

−
gY

)
→
∞
as
d
→
∞.
This
contradiction
completes
the
proof.

The
Main
Theorem
Let
K
be
a
ﬁeld
of
characteristic
zero.
Let
XK
be
a
surface
over
K,
by
which
we
mean
that
XK
is
a
smooth
(geometrically
connected)
variety
over
K
of
dimension
two.
Deﬁnition
a2.1.
We
shall
say
that
XK
is
a
hyperbolically
ﬁbred
surface
if
the
following

condition
holds:
There
exists
a
hyperbolic
curve
XK
over
K,
together
with
a
smooth,

proper,
connected
morphism
X
K
→
XK
of
relative
dimension
one
such
that
XK
embeds
as
an
open
subvariety
of
X
K
satisfying
the
following
conditions:
(i)
X
K
−
XK
is
a
divisor


;
(ii)
the
geometric
ﬁbers
of
XK
⊆
X
K
→
XK
are
hyperbolic
in
X
K
which
is
étale
over
XK
curves.

If
XK
is
a
hyperbolically
ﬁbred
surface,
then
we
shall
refer
to
XK
→
XK
(as
above)
as
a
parametrizing
morphism
for
XK
.
Note
that
given
a
hyperbolically
ﬁbered
surface
XK
,
in
general,
there
can
exist
more
than

is
a
parametrizing
morphism
for
one
parametrizing
morphism
for
XK
.
If
XK
→
XK
XK
,
and
FΩ
⊆
XK
is
a
ﬁber
of
this
morphism
(over
some
point
of
XK
(Ω)
valued
in
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
Ω),
then
we
have
an
exact
sequence
of
fundamental
groups:
1
→
ΠFΩ
→
ΠXK
→
ΠX

→
1
K

are
hyperbolic
curves,
it
follows
that
ΠFΩ
and
ΠX

(hence
Note
that
since
FΩ
and
XK
K
also
ΠXK
)
are
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated.
Now
let
K
be
sub-p-adic
(cf.
Deﬁnition
15.4
(i))
(for
some
prime
number
p),
and
let
XK
and
YK
be
hyperbolically
ﬁbred
surfaces
over
K.
Let
φ
:
ΠXK
→
ΠYK
be
a
continuous
group
isomorphism
over
ΓK
.
We
would
like
to
show
that
φ
arises
geometrically.
Let
ζY
:
YK
→
YK
be
a
parametrizing
morphism
for
YK
.
Then
by
composing
φ
with
π1
(ζY
),
we
obtain
a
continuous
surjection
ΠXK
→
ΠY

.
By
Theorem
A,
it
follows
K
that
this
surjection
arises
geometrically,
from
some
morphism
XK
→
YK
.
Thus,
we
may
regard
XK
and
YK
as
objects
over
YK
.
Let
ZK
be
the
normalization
of
YK
in
XK
.
Thus,
the
morphism
XK
→
YK
factors
through
δ
:
ZK
→
YK
.
Observe
that
ZK
is
a
smooth,
geometrically
connected
(since
XK
is
geometrically
connected
over
K)
curve
over
K,
and
that
ZK
→
YK
is
ﬁnite.
(In
particular,
since
YK
is
hyperbolic,
it
follows
that
ZK
is
also
hyperbolic.)
Moreover,
it
follows
from
the
deﬁnition
of
ZK
that
the
morphism
ΠXK
→
ΠZK
induced
by
XK
→
ZK
is
surjective.
This
implies
that
Ker(π(δ))
is
a
quotient
of
Ker(ΠXK
→
ΠY

)
∼
=
Ker(ΠYK
→
ΠY

),
which
(by
the
deﬁnition
of
a
hyperbolically
ﬁbred
K
K
97
surface)
is
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated.
Thus,
it
follows
that
Ker(π(δ))
is
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated.
But
then
Lemma
a1.1
implies
that
ZK
→
YK
is
étale.
On
the
other
hand,
since
ΠXK
→
ΠY

is
surjective,
we
thus
see
that
ZK
→
YK
must
be
an
isomorphism.
K
In
particular,
we
thus
conclude
that
the
generic
ﬁber
of
XK
→
YK
is
smooth,
geometrically
connected,
and
of
dimension
one.
In
fact,
the
argument
of
the
preceding
paragraph
can
be
applied
more
generally
to
coverings
of
XK
,
as
follows:
Let
YK
→
YK
be
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
such
that
YK
is
geometrically
connected
over
K.
Let
YK
→
YK
×YK
YK
be
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
such
that
K
→
XK
be
the
covering
corresponding
(via
YK
→
YK
is
geometrically
connected.
Let
X
K
→
XK
factors
through
X
K
→
XK
×Y

Y

.
Then
I
claim
that
φ)
to
YK
→
YK
.
Thus,
X
K
K
K
→
Y

is
geometrically
connected.
Indeed,
this
follows
by
the
same
argument
as
that
X
K
employed
in
the
preceding
paragraph:
Namely,
we
simply
observe
that
Π
→
Π

is
K
K
X
Y
isomorphic
to
Π
→
Π

,
which
is
surjective
with
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated
kernel.
K
K
Y
Y
This
proves
the
claim.
Let
L
be
the
function
ﬁeld
of
YK
;
let
L
be
its
algebraic
closure.
Note
that
the
natural
map
Spec(L)
→
YK
factors
through
YK
.
Moreover,
the
above
claim
K
×

Spec(L)
K
→
Y

via
Spec(L)
→
Y

,
the
resulting
X
implies
that
if
we
base-change
X
K
K
K
Y
is
connected.
Now
let
us
reinterpret
the
conclusions
of
the
preceding
paragraph
in
terms
of
fundadef
def
mental
groups.
Let
ηY

be
the
generic
point
of
YK
.
Let
YηY

=
YK
×YK
ηY

;
XηY

=
XK
×YK
ηY

.
Then
what
we
did
in
the
preceding
paragraph
implies
precisely
that
the
morphism
Ker(π1
(XηY

)
→
π1
(ηY

))
→
Ker(π1
(YηY

)
→
π1
(ηY

))
=
Ker(ΠYK
→
ΠY

)
K
(induced
by
φ)
is
surjective.
Thus,
we
see
that
by
composing
the
natural
surjection
of
π1
(XηY

)
onto
ΠXK
with
φ,
we
obtain
a
continuous
surjective
group
homomorphism
φηY

:
ΠXη

→
ΠYη

Y
Y
over
ΓηY

(where
we
regard
XηY

and
YηY

as
curves
over
ηY

).
Now
we
would
like
to
apply
Theorem
A
again.
This
Theorem
tells
us
that
φηY

arises
geometrically
from
some
ηY

-morphism
XηY

→
YηY

.
Remark.
Note
that
in
the
argument
of
the
preceding
three
paragraphs,
it
was
absolutely
essential
to
invoke
Lemma
a1.1
before
we
could
apply
Theorem
A.
In
fact,
if
the
variety
“on
the
left”
(i.e.,
in
this
case,
XηY

)
is
not
geometrically
connected
over
the
base
ﬁeld
(i.e.,
in
this
case,
L),
then
it
is
not
diﬃcult
to
see
that
Theorem
A
does
not
hold.
Indeed,
to
construct
such
a
counterexample,
suppose
that
YK
is
proper,
and
let
HK
⊆
YK
be
a
98
hyperplane
section
(with
respect
to
some
projective
embedding
of
YK
)
such
that
HK
is
smooth
and
geometrically
connected
over
K,
and
π1
(HK
)
→
π1
(YK
)
is
surjective.
(Such
an
HK
exists
by
the
Lefshetz
hyperplane
theorem.)
Write
ηH
for
the
generic
point
of
HK
,
and
take
for
our
“XηY

”
any
hyperbolic
curve
over
ηH
.
Then
note
that
(if
HK
is
suﬃciently
generic
so
that
every
ﬁber
of
HK
→
YK
contains
at
least
one
point
at
which
HK
→
YK
is
étale,
then)
the
induced
morphism
π1
(ηH
)
→
π1
(YηY

)
is
also
surjective,
so
we
get
a
surjective
morphism
π1
(XηY

)
→
π1
(YηY

)
(by
composing
the
(necessarily
surjective)
structure
morphism
π1
(XηY

)
→
π1
(ηH
)
with
π1
(ηH
)
→
π1
(YηY

)).
But
this
surjective
morphism
does
not
arise
from
a
dominant
morphism
XηY

→
YηY

.
This
completes
the
portion
of
the
proof
which
is
an
application
of
(the
nontrivial,
surjectivity
part
of)
Theorem
A.
The
remainder
of
the
proof
will
consists
of
using
elementary
algebraic
geometry
to
show
that
the
morphism
XηY

→
YηY

constructed
above
extends
to
a
morphism
XK
→
YK
.
Lemma
a2.2.
The
morphism
XηY

→
YηY

above
extends
to
a
morphism
XK
→
YK
.
Proof.
First,
observe
that
there
exists
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
VK
→
YK
with
the
following
properties:
(1)
VK
is
a
hyperbolically
ﬁbered
surface
that
admits
a
parametrizing
morphism
VK
→
VK
that
ﬁts
into
a
commutative
diagram:
VK
⏐
⏐

−→
VK
⏐
⏐

YK
−→
YK
(2)
The
ﬁbers
of
VK
→
VK
have
genus
≥
2.
Let
UK
→
XK
be
the
ﬁnite
étale
covering
that
corresponds
(via
φ)
to
VK
→
YK
.
Let
V
K
→
VK
be
the
family
of
proper
hyperbolic
curves
that
compactiﬁes
VK
→
VK
(as
in
Deﬁnition
a2.1).
Write
ηV

for
the
generic
point
of
VK
.
Note
that
there
exists
a
natural
map
UK
→
VK
covering
XK
→
YK
,
and
that
both
UK
and
VK
are
geometrically
connected
over
K
→
Y

is
geometrically
connected).
ηV

(cf.
the
argument
used
above
to
show
that
X
K
Thus,
we
may
form
(geometrically
connected)
ηV

-curves
UηV

,
VηV

.
Moreover,
by
the
deﬁnition
of
UK
,
we
have
a
commutative
diagram
UηV

⏐
⏐

−→
VηV

⏐
⏐

XηY


Y

−→
V
ηV

Thus,
in
particular,
we
obtain
a
morphism
UηV

→
V
ηV

(over
ηV

).
I
claim
that
this
morphism
extends
to
a
morphism
UK
→
V
K
.
Indeed,
by
the
elementary
theory
of
surfaces
–
“elimination
of
indeterminacy”
(see,
e.g.,
Theorem
5.5
of
Chapter
V
of
[Harts])
–
it
follows
K
→
UK
(obtained
by
successively
blowing
up
smooth
points)
such
that
there
exists
some
U
that
the
birational
transformation
from
UK
to
V
K
deﬁned
by
UηV

→
V
ηV

extends
to
a
K
necessarily
maps
K
→
V
K
.
On
the
other
hand,
any
exceptional
curve
in
U
morphism
U


into
a
ﬁber
of
V
K
→
VK
(this
follows
since
UK
→
VK
is
already
a
morphism).
Thus,
any
K
maps
quasi-ﬁnitely
into
a
ﬁber
of
V
K
→
V

(which
will
always
be
a
exceptional
P1
in
U
K
smooth,
proper,
hyperbolic
curve)
–
which
is
clearly
absurd.
This
contradiction
completes
the
proof
of
the
claim.
Thus,
we
have
a
morphism
UK
→
V
K
.
Let
Y
K
→
YK
compactify
YK
→
YK
(as
in
Deﬁnition
a2.1).
Then
clearly
VK
→
YK
extends
to
a
ﬁnite
(in
general,
ramiﬁed)
morphism
V
K
→
Y
K
.
Thus,
to
summarize,
we
have
a
rational
map
from
XK
to
Y
K
which
is
covered
by
a
morphism
UK
→
V
K
,
where
UK
(respectively,
V
K
)
is
ﬁnite
over
XK
(respectively,
Y
K
).
By
elementary
algebraic
geometry,
this
implies
that
we
get
a
morphism
XK
→
Y
K
(covered
by
UK
→
V
K
).
To
complete
the
proof
of
the
Lemma,
we
must
verify
that
this
morphism
XK
→
Y
K
factors
through
YK
.
To
do
this,
we
simply
choose
VK
→
YK
in
the
above
argument
such
that
VK
is
ramiﬁed,
with
very
large
(say,
compared
to
the
degree
of
XK
→
Y
K
)
ramiﬁcation
index,
over
all
of
the
divisor
Y
K
−
YK
.
(Note
that
such
coverings
exist,
by
the
exact
sequence
of
fundamental
groups
following
Deﬁnition
a2.1,
plus
the
well-known
fact
from
topology
that
the
fundamental
group
of
a
compact
surface
with
ﬁnitely
many
punctures
has
coverings
with
arbitrarily
large
ramiﬁcation
index
at
those
punctures.)
Then
since
XK
→
Y
K
is
covered
by
UK
→
V
K
,
and
UK
→
XK
is
ﬁnite
étale,
we
see
that
we
obtain
a
contradiction,
unless
XK
→
Y
K
maps
into
YK
.
Thus,
we
conclude
that
we
have
a
morphism
XK
→
YK
,
as
desired.
Let
us
summarize
what
we
have
done
so
far.
We
started
with
a
continuous
group
isomorphism
φ
:
ΠXK
→
ΠYK
over
ΓK
.
From
φ,
we
constructed
a
K-morphism
XK
→
YK
,
which
we
denote
by
α.
Since
φ
is
invertible,
we
thus
see
that
we
have
also
constructed
a
K-morphism
β
:
YK
→
XK
from
φ−1
.
Since
everything
we
have
been
doing
is
functorial,
it
follows
that
π1
(β
◦
α)
is
the
identity
on
ΠXK
(up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
arising
from
an
element
of
ΔX
).
Thus,
by
Lemma
a2.3
below,
we
conclude
that
β
◦
α
is
the
identity
on
XK
.
Similarly,
α
◦
β
is
the
identity
on
YK
.
Lemma
a2.3.
Let
γ
:
XK
→
XK
be
a
K-morphism
such
that
π1
(γ)
is
the
identity
on
ΠXK
(up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
arising
from
an
element
of
ΔX
).
Then
γ
is
the
identity.
100
Proof.
First
observe
that
π1
(γ)
is
trivially
compatible
(up
to
composition
with
a
geometric

.
Thus,
(the
injectivity
inner
automorphism)
with
the
map
induced
by
π1
’s
by
XK
→
XK

part
of)
Theorem
A
tells
us
that
γ
is
compatible
with
XK
→
XK
.
Let
ηX

be
the

generic
point
of
XK
.
Then
γ
deﬁnes
a
morphism
γηX

:
XηX

→
XηX

which
induces
the
identity
(up
to
composition
with
a
geometric
inner
automorphism)
on
π1
’s.
Applying
(the
injectivity
part
of)
Theorem
A
again
then
tells
us
that
γηX

is
the
identity.
Thus,
it
follows
that
γ
is
the
identity,
as
desired.
Thus,
α
and
β
are
isomorphisms.
Moreover,
it
follows
from
the
construction
of
α
that
π1
(α)
coincides
with
φ
(up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
arising
from
an
element
of
ΔY
),
and
it
follows
from
Lemma
a2.3
that
α
is
the
unique
such
K-isomorphism
XK
∼
=
YK
.
Thus,
we
see
that
we
see
that
we
have
proven
the
following
result:
Theorem
a2.4.
Let
K
be
sub-p-adic
(cf.
Deﬁnition
15.4
(i)).
Let
XK
and
YK
be
hyperbolically
ﬁbred
surfaces
over
K.
Let
IsomK
(XK
,
YK
