f
:
C
→
P1
of
the
projective
line
by
smooth
curves.
Thus,
from
the
very
outset,
one
sees
that
there
are
essentially
two
ways
to
approach
the
Hurwitz
scheme:
(1)
We
start
with
P1
and
regard
the
objects
of
interest
as
coverings
of
P1
;
(2)
We
start
with
C
and
regard
the
objects
of
interest
as
morphisms
from
C
to
P1
.
One
ﬁnds
that
one
can
obtain
the
most
information
about
the
Hurwitz
scheme
and
its
compactiﬁcation
by
exploiting
interchangeably
these
two
points
of
view.
Our
ﬁrst
main
result
is
the
following
Theorem:
Let
b,d,
and
g
be
integers
such
that
b
=
2d
+
2g
−
2,
g
≥
5
and
d
>
2g
+
4.
Let
H
be
the
Hurwitz
scheme
over
Z[
b!1
]
parametrizing
coverings
of
the
projective
line
of
degree
d
with
b
points
of
ramiﬁcation.
Then
P
ic(H)
is
ﬁnite.
Remark:
The
number
g
in
the
statement
of
the
Theorem
is
the
genus
of
the
“curve
C
upstairs”
of
the
coverings
in
question.
Note,
however,
that
the
Hurwitz
scheme
H,
and
hence
also
the
genus
g,
are
completely
determined
by
b
and
d.
This
Theorem
is
stated
in
§6.7,
of
the
text.
Note
that
although
in
the
statement
of
the
Theorem
here
in
the
introduction,
we
spoke
of
“the”
Hurwitz
“scheme,”
there
are
in
fact
several
diﬀerent
Hurwitz
schemes
used
in
the
literature,
some
of
which
are,
in
fact,
not
schemes,
but
stacks.
For
details
about
the
particular
type
of
Hurwitz
scheme
for
which
the
main
theorem
is
proved,
we
refer
the
reader
to
the
exact
statement
in
§6.7,
as
well
as
to
§1
which
explains
the
notation.
Finally,
we
should
address
the
issue
of
what
happens
if
d
≤
2g
+
4.
Although
our
proof
uses
the
somewhat
leisurely
lower
bound
of
2g
+
4,
it
may
be
possible
to
prove
the
same
result
for
smaller
d
using
essentially
the
same
techniques,
but
being
just
a
bit
more
careful.
Since
at
the
time
this
paper
was
written,
the
author
was
not
particularly
interested
in
this
issue,
he
has
allowed
himself
the
luxury
of
taking
d
to
be
greater
than
2g
+
4.
The
main
idea
of
the
proof
is
that
by
combinatorially
analyzing
the
boundary
of
the
compactiﬁcation
of
the
Hurwitz
scheme,
one
realizes
that
there
are
essentially
three
kinds
of
divisors
in
the
boundary,
which
we
call
excess
divisors
(§4.7),
which
are
“more
important”
than
the
other
divisors
in
the
boundary
in
the
sense
that
the
other
divisors
map
to
sets
of
codimension
≥
2
under
various
natural
morphisms.
On
the
other
hand,
we
can
also
consider
the
moduli
stack
G
(§6.1)
of
pairs
consisting
of
a
smooth
curve
of
genus
g,
together
with
a
linear
system
of
degree
d
and
dimension
1.
The
subset
of
G
consisting
of
those
pairs
that
arise
from
Hurwitz
coverings
is
open
in
G,
and
its
complement
consists
of
three
divisors,
which
correspond
precisely
to
the
excess
divisors.
Using
results
of
Harer
on
the
Picard
group
of
Mg
,
we
show
that
these
three
divisors
on
G
form
a
basis
of
P
ic(G)⊗Z
Q,
and
in
fact,
we
even
compute
explicitly
(§7)
the
matrix
relating
these
three
divisors
on
G
to
a
certain
standard
basis
of
P
ic(G)
⊗Z
Q.
The
above
Theorem
then
follows
formally.
2
Crucial
to
our
study
of
the
Hurwitz
scheme
is
its
compactiﬁcation
by
means
of
admissible
coverings,
a
notion
introduced
in
[19].
In
[19],
the
existence
of
a
coarse
moduli
scheme
of
such
coverings
is
stated.
However,
we
could
not
follow
a
certain
key
step
in
the
construction
of
this
coarse
moduli
scheme,
and
so
we
decided
that
it
would
be
best
to
give
a
treatment
of
such
coverings
independent
of
[19].
In
fact,
we
study
a
more
general
sort
of
admissible
covering
than
[19],
between
stable
curves
of
arbitrary
genus,
and
we
prove
a
rather
general
theorem
(§3.22)
concerning
the
existence
of
a
canonical
logarithmic
(in
the
sense
of
[21])
algebraic
stack
(A,
MA
)
parametrizing
such
coverings:
Theorem:
Fix
nonnegative
integers
g,
r,
q,
s,
d
such
that
2g
−
2
+
r
=
d(2q
−
2
+
s)
≥
1.
Let
A
be
the
stack
over
Z
deﬁned
as
follows:
For
a
scheme
S,
the
objects
of
A(S)
are
admissible
coverings
π
:
C
→
D
of
degree
d
from
a
symmetrically
r-pointed
stable
curve
(f
:
C
→
S;
μf
⊆
C)
of
genus
g
to
a
symmetrically
s-pointed
stable
curve
(h
:
D
→
S;
μh
⊆
D)
of
genus
q;
and
the
morphisms
of
A(S)
are
pairs
of
S-isomorphisms
α
:
C
→
C
and
β
:
D
→
D
that
stabilize
the
divisors
of
marked
points
such
that
π
◦
α
=
β
◦
π.
Then
A
is
a
separated
algebraic
stack
of
ﬁnite
type
over
Z.
Moreover,
A
is
equipped
with
a
canonical
log
log
structure
MA
→
OA
,
together
with
a
logarithmic
morphism
(A,
MA
)
→
MS
q,s
(obtained
1
].
by
mapping
(C;
D;
π)
→
D)
which
is
log
étale
(always)
and
proper
over
Z[
d!
Now
we
summarize
what
we
do
section
by
section.
In
§1,
we
deﬁne
various
Hurwitz
schemes
as
well
as
certain
auxiliary
objects
to
be
used
later.
All
of
these
objects
have
both
“combinatorial”
(corresponding
to
the
ﬁrst
point
of
view)
and
“algebro-
geometric”
(corresponding
to
the
second
point
of
view)
deﬁnitions.
In
§2,
we
use
the
combinatorial
point
of
view
to
prove
the
irreducibility
of
many
of
the
objects
of
§1.
In
§3,
we
discuss
admissible
coverings
from
the
point
of
view
of
log
schemes,
and
prove
the
Theorem
just
stated
above.
In
§4,
the
culmination
of
our
exploitation
of
the
combinatorial
point
of
view,
we
explicitly
enumerate
and
construct
the
divisors
at
inﬁnity
of
the
compactiﬁcation,
and
begin
the
determination
of
the
the
divisor
class
group
of
the
Hurwitz
scheme.
From
then
on,
we
switch
gears
to
the
second,
or
more
algebro-geometric,
point
of
view.
In
§5,
we
prepare
for
this
by
reviewing
certain
relevant
cohomological
results.
In
§6,
we
carry
out
a
detailed
study
of
the
“excess
divisors”
at
inﬁnity
and
thereby
complete
the
proof
of
the
ﬁniteness
of
the
divisor
class
group
of
the
Hurwitz
scheme,
modulo
a
technical
result
from
the
next
Section.
Finally,
in
§7,
to
make
our
understanding
of
the
excess
divisors
more
explicit,
we
carry
out
certain
calculations
relating
the
excess
divisors
to
other,
better
known
line
bundles,
which
also
serve
to
complete
the
proof
of
the
technical
result
needed
earlier.
§8
is
purely
conjectural
and
proposes
possible
applications
of
the
results
discussed
previously
to
prove
arithmetic
results.
In
particular,
the
explicit
calculations
of
§7
suggest
a
possible
application
to
an
eﬀective
form
of
the
Mordell
conjecture.
The
reader
who
is
interested
in
the
circle
of
ideas
dealt
with
in
this
paper
may
also
consult
the
related
work
of
Arbarello,
Harris,
and
Diaz
on
Severi
varieties;
see,
for
instance,
[18].
Although
the
results
of
[18]
are
not
literally
the
same
as
ours,
they
are
certainly
3
closely
philosophically
related.
Also,
D.
Edidin
has
been
preparing
a
paper
that
gives
similar
results,
although
at
the
present
time,
I
have
not
yet
seen
this
paper.
Finally,
although
we
treat
here
the
case
when
the
dimension
of
the
Hurwitz
scheme
is
rather
large,
when
the
dimension
is
very
small
(i.e.,
1
or
2),
one
has
the
results
of
[6]
and
[7].
An
earlier
version
of
this
paper
was
submitted
as
my
doctoral
dissertation
at
Princeton
University
in
the
spring
of
1992.
I
would
like
to
thank
my
advisor,
Prof.
G.
Faltings,
both
for
suggesting
the
topic
and
for
his
advice
and
support
during
my
years
as
a
graduate
student.
Also,
although
none
of
our
conversations
contributed
directly
to
the
material
in
this
paper,
my
general
understanding
of
algebraic
geometry
proﬁted
greatly
from
my
numerous
conversations
with
Prof.
N.
Katz;
I
would,
therefore,
like
to
express
here
my
thanks
to
him,
as
well.
Next,
I
would
like
to
thank
Prof.
K.
Kato
for
explaining
the
notion
of
a
log
structure
to
me
during
the
summer
of
1991.
Finally,
I
would
like
to
express
my
deep
gratitude
to
Profs.
K.
Saito
and
Y.
Ihara
for
encouraging
me
to
publish
this
paper,
despite
substantial
opposition
in
certain
parts
of
the
algebraic
geometry
community
to
the
use
of
stacks.
§1.
Diﬀerent
Types
of
Hurwitz
Schemes
§1.1.
The
original
purpose
of
the
Hurwitz
scheme
is
to
parametrize
coverings
of
the
projective
line
that
have
at
most
simple
branch
points.
However,
since
there
are
several
diﬀerent
versions
of
the
Hurwitz
schemes
running
around
in
the
literature,
we
take
the
opportunity
here
to
standardize
and
make
explicit
which
version
we
are
using
at
any
particular
time.
Also,
it
is
necessary
to
construct
Hurwitz-type
schemes
which
parametrize
coverings
with
worse
ramiﬁcation
than
“simple
branch
points”.
These
generalized
Hurwitz
schemes
will
aid
in
our
elucidation
of
the
geometry
at
inﬁnity
of
the
ordinary
Hurwitz
scheme.
We
shall
omit
some
details
here
since
we
are
essentially
reviewing
well-known
material.
For
more
details,
see
[13].
§1.2.
Remark
on
characteristic
p:
In
general,
in
this
part
of
the
paper,
we
will
work
over
the
ring
Z[
N1
],
where
N
is
divisible
by
all
numbers
characteristic
to
the
problem.
Thus
there
will
be
no
essential
diﬀerence
between
what
we
do
and
what
one
would
do
if
one
were
to
work
over
characteristic
zero.
Indeed,
we
shall
often
prove
some
results
by
reducing
to
the
case
of
characteristic
zero.
Remark
on
Stacks:
We
will
need
to
employ
the
notion
of
an
“algebraic
stack”
(which
we
will
henceforth
call
simply
a
“stack”
for
short)
in
the
sense
of
Deligne-Mumford
[8];
the
reader
who
is
not
satisﬁed
with
the
treatment
given
in
[8]
may
also
refer
to
Chapter
1,
§4,
of
[11]
for
basic
facts
about
stacks.
In
fact,
(see
[11],
Chapter
1,
§4.10)
étale
locally,
every
stack
can
be
formed
by
taking
quotients
(in
the
sense
of
stacks)
of
schemes
by
ﬁnite
group
actions.
We
explain
what
this
means
as
follows:
Let
S
be
a
noetherian
scheme;
let
X
be
an
S-scheme
of
ﬁnite
type;
let
G
be
a
ﬁnite
group
acting
on
X
by
means
of
S-automorphisms.
4
Then
we
shall
denote
by
[X/G]
the
algebraic
stack
deﬁned
by
“taking
the
quotient
of
X
by
G
in
the
sense
of
stacks.”
Concretely,
relative
to
the
“Working
Deﬁnition
of
Algebraic
Stacks”
given
in
[11],
Chapter
1,
§4.9,
[X/G]
is
deﬁned
as
follows:
In
the
notation
of
loc.
cit.,
it
suﬃces
to
specify
schemes
R
and
U
,
together
with
morphisms
s,
t
:
R
→
U
,
and
μ
:
R
×U,t,s
R
→
R.
For
U
,
we
take
X;
for
R,
we
take
G
×
X
(i.e.,
a
disjoint
union
of
copies
of
X
indexed
by
the
elements
of
G).
For
t
:
R
→
U
,
we
take
the
morphism
G
×
X
→
X
that
deﬁnes
the
group
action.
For
s
:
R
→
U
,
we
take
the
projection
G
×
X
on
the
second
factor.
For
μ
:
R
×U,t,s
R
=
(G
×
X)
×X
(G
×
X)
→
R
=
G
×
X,
we
take
the
morphism
that
sends
(g1
,
x)
×
(g2
,
g1
x)
to
(g2
g1
,
x).
Once
checks
easily
that
all
the
necessary
hypotheses
are
satisﬁed.
Now
let
us
suppose
that
X
=
Spec(A)
is
aﬃne.
In
[11],
Theorem
4.10,
a
general
method
is
described
for
passing
from
a
noetherian
algebraic
stack
to
an
associated
coarse
moduli
space
(which
is
general
is
just
an
algebraic
space,
not
necessarily
a
scheme).
If
one
applies
this
Theorem
to
the
algebraic
stack
[X/G]
just
constructed,
one
sees
easily
that
one
obtains
the
scheme
Y
=
Spec(AG
)
(where
AG
⊆
A
is
the
subring
of
functions
invariant
under
the
action
of
G)
as
the
coarse
moduli
space
associated
to
[X/G].
§1.3.
We
start
with
the
ordinary
Hurwitz
scheme.
Let
b,d,
and
g
be
natural
numbers
subject
to
the
relation
2(g
−
1)
=
−2d
+
b,
with
b
≥
4.
Psychologically,
g
is
the
the
genus
of
the
curve
upstairs,
b
is
the
number
of
branch
point
of
the
covering,
and
d
is
the
degree
of
the
covering.
Suppose
we
wish
to
parametrize
sets
of
b
distinct
points
of
P1
.
Let
R
=
Z[
b!1
].
(The
reason
for
inverting
these
primes
is
so
that
all
of
our
coverings
of
degree
b
or
d
will
have
tame
ramiﬁcation,
as
well
as
Galois
closures
which
are
generically
separable.)
Then
there
are
(at
least)
four
ways
of
doing
this:
we
consider
the
category
C
of
R-schemes
and
the
stack
(in
fact,
a
covariant
functor
in
the
ﬁrst
three
cases)
on
C,
that
assigns
to
S
(an
object
of
C)
one
of
the
four
following
categories
(or
sets
in
the
ﬁrst
three
cases):
(1)
“U
Ob
”
(=“unrigidiﬁed
ordered”):
ordered
sets
of
sections
σ1
,
.
.
.
,
σb
:
S
→
S
×
P1
(i.e.,
such
that
composing
further
with
the
ﬁrst
projection
S
×
P1
→
S
is
the
identity)
such
that
the
images
of
σi
and
σj
do
not
intersect
when
i
=
j;
(2)
“U
Sb
”
(=“unrigiﬁed
symmetrized”):
divisors
D
⊆
S
×
P1
étale
over
S
of
degree
b;
(3)
“ROb
”
(=“rigidiﬁed
ordered”):
isomorphism
classes
of
ordered
sets
of
sections
as
in
(1),
where
by
“isomorphism”
we
mean
that
we
regard
{σ1
,
.
.
.
,
σb
}
as
isomorphic
to
{σ1
,
.
.
.
,
σb
}
if
there
exists
an
Sautomorphism
of
S
×
P1
that
carries
{σ1
,
.
.
.
,
σb
}
to
{σ1
,
.
.
.
,
σb
};
(4)
“RSb
”
(=“rigidiﬁed
symmetrized”):
the
stack
whose
objects
are
étale
divisors
in
P1
-bundles
(in
the
étale
topology)
over
S,
and
whose
morphisms
are
isomorphisms
of
P1
-bundles
that
preserve
the
designated
5
divisors.
Put
another
way,
this
stack
is
the
stack
obtained
by
taking
the
quotient
(in
the
sense
of
stacks)
of
the
functor
deﬁned
in
(3)
by
the
natural
action
of
S
b
(the
symmetric
group
on
b
letters)
given
by
permuting
the
marked
sections.
Although
the
use
of
the
terminology
“rigidiﬁed”
here
may
at
ﬁrst
appear
counterintuitive
in
the
sense
that
often
one
adds
a
“rigidifying
structure,”
then
forms
the
quotient
by
the
action
of
some
algebraic
group,
here
we
chose
to
use
this
terminology
in
the
sense
that
“rigidiﬁcation”
consists
in
ﬁxing
the
ﬁrst
three
points
at
0,1,
and
∞,
whereas
in
the
“unrigidiﬁed
situation”
all
the
points
are
ﬂoating
around
freely,
hence
not
ﬁxed
or
rigidiﬁed.
It
is
elementary
that
each
of
the
above
four
functors
is
representable
by
a
smooth,
quasi-compact
stack
(in
fact,
a
scheme
for
the
ﬁrst
three
functors)
over
R.
Namely:
(1)
U
Ob
:
Here
we
simply
take
(P1
)b
−
{diagonals}.
(2)
U
Sb
:
We
form
the
quotient
by
the
action
of
S
b
,
the
symmetric
group
on
b
letters
acting
on
U
Ob
by
permuting
the
b
factors
of
P1
,
to
obtain
the
appropriate
scheme,
which
may
be
naturally
regarded
as
an
open
subset
of
Pb
,
namely,
the
complement
of
the
discriminant
locus.
(3)
ROb
:
For
1
≤
i,
j
≤
b
−
3
with
i
=
j,
let
Δij
⊆
(P1
)b−3
be
the
(i,
j)diagonal.
Let
pi
:
(P1
)b−3
→
P1
for
1
≤
i
≤
b
−
3
be
the
ith
projection.
Then

−1
Δij
∪
pi
({0,
1,
∞})
(P1
)b−3

does
the
job.
(4)
RSb
:
Clearly
S
b
acts
on
ROb
in
such
a
way
that
the
action
is
generically
free.
If
we
form
the
quotient
by
this
action
in
the
sense
of
stacks
(as
reviewed
in
§1.2),
we
obtain
the
desired
algebraic
stack,
which
is
generically
a
scheme.
We
will
refer
to
any
one
of
these
four
schemes
(resp.
functors,
stacks
as
“b-point
schemes
(resp.
functors,
stacks)”,
preﬁxing
this
term
with
the
appropriate
descriptives
“rigidiﬁed”,
“ordered”,
etc.
when
necessary,
and
omitting
the
“b”
when
speaking
generally.
These
four
b-point
stacks
ﬁt
into
the
following
commutative
diagram:
U
Ob
⏐
⏐

−→
U
Sb
⏐
⏐

ROb
−→
RSb
6
(Diagram
1.1A)
Note
that
the
vertical
arrows
are
P
GL(2)-torsors,
while
the
horizontal
arrows
are
S
b
torsors.
Thus,
when
we
tensor
with
C
and
take
the
topological
fundamental
group,
we
get:
π1top
(UOb,C
)
⏐

(Diagram

π1top
(RSb,C
)
Here
the
horizontal
arrows
are
injections
and
the
vertical
arrows
are
surjections;
also,
by
“topological
fundamental
group,”
we
mean
in
the
sense
of
stacks,
i.e.,
the
fundamental
group
formed
by
considering
étale
coverings
of
the
stack
in
question
by
analytic
stacks.
Finally,
let
us
note
that
U
Sb
is
used
in
[13],
while
ROb
is
used
in
[19].
Let
T
be
any
one
of
the
four
b-point
stacks
(resp.
schemes).
Then
to
T,
we
may
associate
a
Hurwitz
stack
H
in
such
a
way
that
H
is
étale
over
T,
hence
representable
by
an
algebraic
stack.
Indeed,
consider
the
following
stacks
(which
are
schemes
in
the
ﬁrst
three
cases,
so
long
as
d
≥
2)
over
C:
(1)
HU
Ob,d
:
data
of
the
following
form:
an
arrow
α
:
C
→
P1
in
the
category
of
S-schemes
such
that
the
induced
arrow
C
→
S
is
a
smooth,
geometrically
connected,
proper
curve
of
genus
g,
and
where
α
is
ﬂat
of
degree
d
with
simple
ramiﬁcation
(i.e.,
the
discriminant
divisor
is
étale
over
the
base
–
see
[13],
§5)
exactly
at
given
sections
σ1
,
.
.
.
,
σb
:
S
→
P1
,
where
the
σi
’s
are
mutually
disjoint
S-sections;
(2)
HU
Sb,d
:
same
sort
of
data
as
above
except
that
instead
of
the
σi
’s,
we
are
given
a
divisor
D
⊆
S
×
P1
which
is
ﬁnite
étale
over
S
of
degree
d,
at
which
the
simple
ramiﬁcation
is
to
take
place;
(3)
HROb,d
:
isomorphism
classes
of
the
data
in
(1),
where
isomorphisms
involve
automorphisms
over
S
of
P1
that
carry
one
set
of
sections
to
the
other,
and
over
which
there
is
an
isomorphism
of
the
respective
curves
C;
(4)
HRSb,d
:
stack
whose
objects
are
collections
of
data
as
in
(2),
except
that
we
replace
S
×
P1
by
an
arbitrary
P1
-bundle
in
the
étale
topology,
and
whose
morphisms
are
isomorphisms
of
P1
-bundles
that
preserve
the
designated
divisors
and
over
which
lies
an
isomorphism
of
the
respective
curves
C.
We
see
easily
by
Grothendieck’s
representability
theorem
(as
applied
in
[13],
§6)
that
all
four
of
these
Hurwitz
stacks
are
relatively
representable
by
étale
morphisms
over
their
respective
b-point
schemes.
The
key
fact
in
the
proof
of
loc.
cit.
(and
proven
there
on
p.
566)
is
the
following
result,
whose
proof
we
repeat
here
for
the
convenience
of
the
reader
(in
a
slightly
more
general
form):
7
Lemma
:
Let
k
be
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld,
f
:
C
→
P1k
a
covering
of
degree
d
≥
3,
where
C
is
a
smooth,
connected,
proper
curve
of
genus
≥
2
over
k.
We
assume
that
C
is
simply
ramiﬁed
over
P1k
,
except
possibly
at
one
point
p
∈
P1k
,
where
we
allow
arbitrary
ramiﬁcation.
If
ϕ
:
C
→
C
is
an
automorphism
such
that
f
◦
ϕ
=
f
,
then
ϕ
=
id.
Proof:
(cf.
[13],
p.
548
—
the
problem
with
Fulton’s
proof
is
that
it
apparently
makes
use
of
the
characteristic
zero
assumption,
so
we
trivially
generalize
his
proof
here
for
the
1
sake
of
completeness).
Let
μ
=
Hét
(ϕ)
denote
the
induced
map
on
l-adic
cohomology,
where
l
is
diﬀerent
from
the
characteristic
of
k.
Since,
as
in
well-known
the
automorphism
group
of
C
is
ﬁnite,
we
see
that
μ
must
have
eigenvalues
that
are
roots
of
unity;
hence
|T
r(μ)|
≤
2g
(under
any
embedding
of
an
algebraic
closure
of
Q
into
C).
Thus,
by
the
Lefshetz
ﬁxed
point
theorem,
the
number
of
ﬁxed
points
of
ϕ
is
≤
2g
+
2.
But
since
ϕ
must
ﬁx
the
≥
(2g
−
2)
+
2d
+
1
−
(d
−
1)
=
2g
+
d
≥
2g
+
3
branch
points,
we
have
a
contradiction
unless
ϕ
=
id.
Let
us
note
that
if
T

is
another
b-point
stack
with
corresponding
Hurwitz
stack
H

,
and
if
T

→
T
is
one
of
the
arrows
in
Diagram
1.1A,
then
we
have
H

=
H
×T
T

.
§1.4.
We
are
now
going
to
deﬁne
generalizations
of
the
Hurwitz
stacks,
namely,
“degenerate
Hurwitz
stacks”,
which
we
shall
use
to
make
explicit
the
compactiﬁcation
of
the
original
Hurwitz
stacks.
We
start
by
deﬁning
“degenerate
b-point
stacks”.
The
reason
for
the
use
of
the
descriptor
“degenerate”
will
become
clear
once
these
Hurwitz-type
stacks
are
deﬁned.
As
usual,
we
have
four
types,
of
which
the
ﬁrst
three
are
schemes:
(1)
DU
Ob
:
We
take
U
Ob
.
(2)
DU
Sb
:
Let
S
b−1
act
on
the
ﬁrst
b
−
1
sections
of
U
Ob
.
Then
take
the
quotient
of
U
Ob
by
this
action.
Note
that
(1)
and
(2)
can
be
deﬁned
also
for
b
=
3.
(3)
DROb
:
We
take
ROb
,
when
b
≥
4.
When
b
=
3,
we
take
RO3
=
Spec
R.
(4)
DRSb
:
As
before
S
b−1
acts
on
ROb
.
Take
the
quotient
by
this
action
in
the
sense
of
stacks
if
b
≥
4.
When
b
=
3,
take
RS3
=
Spec
R.
As
before,
there
is
a
functorial
interpretation
of
these
degenerate
b-point
stacks.
We
leave
it
to
the
reader
to
work
out
this
interpretation
in
terms
of
various
sorts
of
collections
of
sections
of
divisors
in
P1
.
In
this
interpretation,
we
shall
call
the
ﬁrst
b
−
1
sections
(resp.
the
étale
divisor
induced
by
the
ﬁrst
b
−
1
sections)
the
marking
sections
(resp.
marking
divisor)
and
the
last
(i.e.,
bth
)
section
the
clutching
section.
Now
ﬁx
σ
∈
S
d
.
Let
T
=
one
of
the
degenerate
b-point
stacks.
Then
we
denote
by
M
⊆
P1
×
T
(resp.
C
⊆
P1
×
T
)
the
marking
(resp.
clutching)
divisor.
Let
D
=
M
∪
C.
Then
M
,
C,
and
D
are
relative
T
-divisors
with
normal
crossings.
Moreover,
T
is
smooth
8
over
our
original
ring
R.
Now
by
[29],
Exposé
XIII,
Appendice
I,
we
can
form
F

R1ét
f∗
S

,
where
U
=
(P1

T

−
D,
f
:
U
→
T
is
the
restriction
of
the
projection
to
the
second
factor
π2
:
P1
×
T
→
T
,
and
(by
abuse
of
notation)
S
d
is
the
constant
étale
sheaf
in
noncommutative
groups
on
U




⊇
D

M,
C
T
Thus
F
is
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
T.
Write
g
:
F
→
T
.
For
each
geometric
point
t
of
T
,
g
−1
(t)
can
be
identiﬁed
with
Hom
(π1alg
(P1t
−
Dt
),
S
d
),
where
the
“prime”
after
the
Hom
means
“up
to
inner
automorphism”
(thus
exempting
us
from
the
need
to
choose
a
base
point
for
our
π1
).
Let
us
consider
the
closed
and
open
substack
K
⊆
F,
which
is
also
ﬁnite
étale
over
T
and
which
is
such
that
if
k
=
g|K
,
then
k
−1
(t)
can
be
identiﬁed
with
those
homomorphisms
ϕ
:
π1alg
(P1t
−
Dt
)
→
S
d
such
that:
(1)
ϕ
is
surjective.
(2)
ϕ
takes
the
generators
of
the
monodromy
groups
around
the
marked
points
to
transpositions.
(3)
ϕ
takes
the
generator
of
the
monodromy
group
around
the
clutching
point
to
a
conjugate
of
σ.
Then
K
will
be
our
degenerate
Hurwitz
stack,
which
we
shall
denote,
depending
on
the
situation
by
DHU
Oσb,d
;
DHU
S
σb,d
;
DHROσb,d
;
or
DHRS
σb,d
(of
which
all
but
the
last
are
schemes).
Note
that
the
degenerate
Hurwitz
stacks
corresponding
to
conjugate
σ
may
be
naturally
identiﬁed.
§1.5.
Remark:
Unlike
the
original
Hurwitz
stacks,
it
is
not
clear
(at
least
to
the
author)
that
these
degenerate
Hurwitz
stacks
should
have
any
modular
interpretation
at
all.
Indeed,
the
logic
of
[13],
§1.4,
1.5,
does
not
follow
through
here
because
of
the
more
complicated
nature
of
the
ramiﬁcation
involved.
The
problem
is
that
if
we
denote
by
F
what
one
might
think
is
the
appropriate
modular
stack
(in
terms
of
coverings
of
the
projective
line),
and
by
DH
one
of
the
degenerate
Hurwitz
stacks,
we
get
morphisms
α
:
F
→
DH
(clear)
and
β
:
DH
→
F
(by
the
“pseudo-universal”
covering
to
be
constructed
in
the
following
paragraph)
and
one
can
show
that
α
◦
β
=
1DH
,
hence
that
α
is
smooth.
But
in
order
to
show
that
it
is
étale,
one
needs,
in
the
case
of
simple
coverings,
the
fact
that
the
discriminant
divisor
is
étale;
since
one
does
not
have
this
fact
here,
one
cannot
follow
through
as
before.
However,
if
DH
is
one
of
the
degenerate
Hurwitz
stacks,
we
can
construct
what
one
might
call
a
“pseudo-universal”
covering
as
follows.
(Here
we
use
the
term
“pseudouniversal”
loosely
in
the
sense
that
although
DH
does
not
actually
represent
the
moduli
9
stack
F
of
coverings
of
a
certain
type
(in
which
case
the
tautological
covering
over
DH
would
be
called
simply
“universal”),
at
least
over
each
closed
point
of
DH
the
“pseudouniversal”
covering
“is”
the
covering
corresponding
to
that
closed
point).
Indeed,
it
is
tautological
that
there
exists
an
étale
covering
ψ
:
V
→
(P1
×
DH)
−
DDH
such
that
the
normalization
V
→
P1
×
DH
of
P1
×
DH
in
V
is
what
we
want.
The
only
thing
that
is
nonobvious
is
that
V
is
a
smooth,
proper
curve
over
DH.
But
smoothness
follows
from
the
fact
that
DH
is
regular
(since
T
is)
and
by
applying
Abhyankar’s
lemma.
Thus,
to
summarize
we
have
the
following
diagram:
η
−→
C
ζ

DH
×
P1
⏐
⏐

⊇
DDH

MDH
,
CDH
DH
where
C
=
V,
ζ
is
smooth,
proper,
with
geometrically
connected
ﬁbres,
η
is
ﬂat,
étale
outside
of
DDH
,
has
simple
ramiﬁcation
outside
of
CDH
,
and
has
ramiﬁcation
of
the
type
prescribed
by
σ
over
CDH
.
In
particular,
by
the
Lemma
of
§1.3,
it
follows
that
if
d
≥
3,
then
C
has
no
automorphisms
that
ﬁx
η.
§1.6.
Finally,
let
us
note
as
before
that
we
have
diagrams:

π1top

where
the
vertical
arrows
are
surjections,
and
the
horizontal
arrows
are
injections.
Note
that
if
D

→
D
is
an
arrow
in
the
ﬁrst
diagram,
then
with
respect
to
degenerate
Hurwitz
stacks
and
“pseudo-universal”
curves,
we
have
DH


and
C

=
C
×DH
DH
.
Before
continuing,
we
remark
that
although
it
is
not
absolutely
necessary
for
what
follows
to
use
all
four
versions
of
the
Hurwitz
scheme,
we
presented
them
here
in
this
introductory
section
in
some
detail
so
as
to
clarify
which
was
which,
since
to
the
author’s
knowledge,
there
does
not
yet
seem
to
exist
either
standard
notation
or
standard
terminology
in
the
literature
that
allows
one
to
specify
precisely
which
Hurwitz
scheme
one
is
dealing
with
at
any
particular
time.

connectedness,
or
irreducibility.
Here
we
show
that
HU
S
b,d
and
DHU
S
σb,d
–
which
are
schemes,
so
long
as
d
≥
3
–
are
geometrically
irreducible
over
R.
It
then
follows
from
Diagrams
1.1A
and
1.2A
that
the
stacks
HRS
b,d
and
DHRS
σb,d
are
also
geometrically
irreducible
over
R.
To
prove
irreducibility,
we
note
that
as
in
[13],
pp.
546–7,
we
must
show
that
the
fundamental
group
of
the
appropriate
b-point
stack
acts
transitively
on
the
set
corresponding
to
the
étale
covering
which
is
the
Hurwitz
scheme;
as
in
loc.
cit.,
we
see
that
the
fundamental
group
of
the
b-point
stack
has
certain
canonical
elements
that
correspond
to
“braiding”
various
pairs
of
points;
hence
we
are
reduced
to
the
following
combinatorial
Proposition.
§2.2.
Proposition
:
Fix
b,
d
∈
N,
σ
∈
S
d
.
Let
Aσb,d
be
the
set
of
ordered
b-tuples
of
transpositions
{t1
,
.
.
.
,
tb
}
of
S
d
such
that
t1
t2
.
.
.
tb
=
σ
and
such
that
the
group
generated
by
the
ti
’s
acts
transitively
on
{1,
.
.
.
,
d}.
Deﬁne
an
“elementary
move”
on
Aσb,d
as
an
automorphism
of
Aσb,d
that
takes
{t1
,
.
.
.
,
ti
,
ti+1
,
.
.
.
,
tb
}
to
{t1
,
.
.
.
,
ti+1
,
ti+1
ti
ti+1
,
.
.
.
,
tb
}
for
some
i.
Then
the
free
group
F
generated
by
the
elementary
moves
acts
transitively
on
Aσb,d
.
(Psychological
Remark:
In
the
case
of
degenerate
Hurwitz
stacks,
i.e.
σ
=
id,
what
we
have
called
b
here
really
corresponds
to
b
−
1
in
the
previous
section.)
Notational
Remark:
We
shall
denote
chains
of
transpositions
by
<?,
?,
.
.
.
,
?
>,
where
each
of
the
question
marks
is
a
transposition,
and
we
shall
make
elementary
moves
on
such
chains,
where
we
regard
these
chains
as
subchains
of
the
original
b-tuple
of
transpositions.
It
is
clear
that
an
elementary
move
on
such
a
subchain
corresponds
to
an
elementary
move
on
the
original
b-tuple.
We
call
two
elements
t,
t
of
Aσb,d
equivalent
if
they
lie
in
the
same
domain
of
transitivity
of
F.
We
write
t
∼
t
.
Bibliographical
Remark:
It
has
been
brought
to
the
author’s
attention
that
similar
results
were
obtained
using
similar
techniques
in
the
classical
papers
of
[4],
[20],
and
[25],
as
well
as
the
more
recent
paper
of
[2].
§2.3.
Lemma
:
We
have
the
following
relations:
(1)
<
(12),
(23)
>
∼
<
(13),
(12)
>
(2)
<

(23),

∼

<

∼
<

And
lastly:
<
(12),
(12),
(23),
(23),(23),
(23)
>
∼
<
(12),
(12),
(12),
(12),
(23),
(23)

11
Proof:
For
(1)
to
(3),
we
have
<
(12),
(23)
>
∼
<
(23),
(13)
>
∼
Applying
this
twice,
we
get
<
(12),
(23),
(23)
>
<
(13),
(12)

∼
<
(13),
(13),

On
the
other
hand,
<
(12),
(13),
(13)
>
∼
<
(13),
(23),
(13)
>
∼
<
(13),
(13),
(12)
>
Putting
this
together,
we
obtain
(1)
through
(3).
As
for
(4),
one
sees
by
(3)
that,
up
to
equivalence,
both
sides
of
(4)
are
of
the
same
form
in
the
sense
that
they
diﬀer
only
in
that
the
digits
1
and
3
have
opposite
roles
on
the
two
sides;
moreover,
a
chain
of
this
form
may
be
uniquely
speciﬁed
by
stating
which
digit
(i.e.,
of
1,
2,
or
3)
appears
twice,
which
four
times,
and
which
six
times.
For
the
left
hand
side,
these
are,
respectively,
(1,
3,
2);
for
the
right
hand
side,
they
are
(3,
1,
2).
Thus,
if
we
think
of
the
symmetric
group
on
three
letters
acting
on
chains
of
this
form
by
permuting
the
digits
1,
2,
and
3,
we
see
that
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
the
left
hand
side
is
equivalent
both
to
“(2,
3,
1)”
and
to
“(1,
2,
3)”.
By
the
part
of
the
lemma
already
proven,
we
have
that
the
left
hand
side
<
(12),
(12),
(23),
(23),
(23),
(23)
>
∼
<
(12),
(13),
(13),
(13),
(13),
(12)
>
=
what
we
have
referred
to
as
“(2,
3,
1)”.
Since
<
(12),
(23)
>
that
the
left
hand
side
∼
<
(23),
(13)
>,
we
have
<
(12),
(12),
(23),
(23),(23),
(23)
>
∼
<
(23),
(13),
(13),
(23),
(23),
(23)
>
∼
<
(13),
(13),
(23),
(23),
(23),
(23)
>
by
(3).
But
this
last
chain
is
just
“(1,
2,
3)”.
§2.4.
Lemma
:
that
t1
=
(α
β).
Let
α,
β
∈
{1,
.
.
.
,
d}
with
α
=
β.
Let
t
∈
Aσb,d
.
Then
t
∼
t
such
Proof:
Let
us
note
ﬁrst
that
by
the
transitivity
assumption
on
elements
of
Aσb,d
,
we
know
that
α
and
β
must
appear
somewhere
as
digits
in
the
transpositions
of
t.
By
elementary
moves,
we
can
assume
that
t1
contains
α;
by
subsequent
elementary
moves
toward
the
front,
and
the
transitivity
assumption
on
elements
of
Aσb,d
,
we
may
assume
that
t
is
of
the
following
form:
t1
=
(α
x2
),
t2
=
(x2
x3
),
t3
=
(x3
,
x4
),
.
.
.
,
ti
=
(xi
xi+1
),
.
.
.
,
tr
=
(xr
β),
Here
the
xi
’s
are
distinct
from
each
other
and
from
α
and
β.
Now
we
have
<
(α
x3
),
(α
x2
)
>
∼
<
(α
x2
),
(x2
x3
)
>
=
<
t1
,
t2
>
12
with
r≤b
so
by
substituting
<
(α
x3
),
(α
x2
)
>
for
<
t1
,
t2
>,
moving
the
ti
’s
for
3
≤
i
≤
r
down
one
position
to
the
left,
and
sending
(what
would
originally
have
been)
(α
x2
)
out
to
the
right
beyond
what
was
tr
,
we
see
that
we
obtain
the
same
situation
as
what
we
started
with,
except
that
r
is
one
less
than
it
was
before.
Now
apply
induction.
§2.5.
Let
us
prove
the
Proposition
ﬁrst
in
the
case
of
the
nondegenerate
Hurwitz
stack,
(id)
i.e.,
when
σ
=
id.
Let
t
∈
Ab,d
.
We
shall
show
that
t
∼
a
chain
which
consists
of
a
nonzero,
even
number
of
(12)’s,
followed
by
a
nonzero,
even
number
of
(23)’s,
and
so
on
through
(d
−
1,
d).
By
Lemma
3,
(4),
all
such
chains
are
equivalent,
so
we
are
done.
By
transitivity,
Lemma
4
allows
us
to
assume
that
t1
=
(12),
t2
=
(12)
on
account
of
the
fact
that
σ
=
id.
By
using
inverse
elementary
moves
to
bring
things
to
the
front,
we
may
assume
that
t3
,
.
.
.
,
tr
contain
a
“1”,
but
that
ti
(∀i
>
r)
do
not.
We
claim
that
we
may
move
to
a
situation
where
(with
possibly
a
new
r)
t3
,
.
.
.
,
tr
are
all
equal
to
(12).
For,
if
there
is
an
i
such
that
3
≤
i
≤
r
−
1
and
ti
=
(1a),
ti+1
=
(1b)
with
1
=
a
=
b,
then
<
(1a),
(1b)
>
∼
<
(1b),
(ab)
>,
so
we
can
reduce
to
the
same
situation
with
lower
r.
Thus
we
may
assume
that
t3
=
t4
=
.
.
.
=
tr
.
If
t3
=
(12),
then
we
have
proven
the
claim.
If
t3
=
(1a)
with
a
=
2,
then
it
is
easy
to
see
that
r
must
be
even
(since
ti
(∀i
>
r)
doesn’t
contain
a
“1”);
hence,
applying
Lemma
3,
(2),
proves
the
claim.
Now
repeating
the
above
procedure
ﬁnishes
the
proof
for
σ
=
id.
§2.6.
Proof
of
Proposition
2:
Step
A:
First
we
introduce
some
notation.
Write
σ
=
γ1
.
.
.
γr
where
each
(i)
(i)
γi
=
(a1
,
a2
,
.
.
.
,
a(i)
ei
)
is
a
nontrivial
cycle
with
domain
of
transitivity
Δi
such
that
Δi
Δj
=
∅
for
i
=
j.
Let
r
r
q
=
r
+
d
−
(
i=1
ei
),
N
=
(
i=1
ei
)
−
r.
Then
let
the
Δi
for
r
+
1
≤
i
≤
q
be
the
remaining
trivial
domains
of
transitivity
of
σ.
For
simplicity,
let’s
write
1i
,
2i
,
etc.
for
(i)
(i)
a1
,
a2
,
.
.
..
Now
deﬁne

Let
N
denote
the
concatenation
of
chains
Z1
,
Z2
,
.
.
.
,
Zr
.
Now
let
t
∈
Aσb,d
.
By
Lemma
4,
we
see
that
we
may
assume
that
t
begins
with
N
.
(Note
that
this
same
logic
already
proves
the
Proposition
for
Aγ(eii
−1),ei
.)
Thus
we
have
normalized
t1
,
.
.
.
,
tN
.
It
remains
to
deal
with
ti
for
i
>
N
.
Step
B:
Let
D1
,
.
.
.
,
Ds
(⊆
{1,
.
.
.
,
d})
be
the
domains
of
transitivity
of
the
group
gens
erated
by
the
ti
,
for
i
>
N
,
(so
i=1
Di
=
{1,
.
.
.
,
d}
and
Di
Dj
=
∅
∀i
=
j).
For
1
≤
j
≤
s,
let
Pj
=
i
∈
{1,
.
.
.
,
b}|
i>N
and
13
ti
acts
nontrivially
on
Dj
Note
that
if
we
take
the
subchain
τ
j
of
transpositions
of
t
indexed
by
Pj
,
then
τ
j
∈
(id)
A|Pj
|,|Dj
|
.
By
§2.5,
we
may
assume
that
τ
j
consists
of
a
sequence
of
pairs
of
identical
transpositions.
Now
we
claim:
Claim
:
If
q
=
1,
then
we
may
assume
that
every
ti
x
∈
Δk
,
y

k
=
l.
(∀i

is
of
the

with
Proof
of
Claim
:
Suppose
we
have
a
pair
ti

where
i
≡
N

1
(mod

and
a,
b
∈
Δk
with
a
=
b.
Since
all
the
ti
’s
together
generate
a
group
transitive
on
{1,

.

,
d},
there
exists
a
j
>
N
with
j
≡
N
+
1
(mod
2)
such
that
tj
=
tj+1
=
(cd)
with
c
∈
Δk
and
d
∈
Δl
where
l
=
k.
We
may
move
ti
,
ti+1
so
that
they
are
adjacent
to
tj
,
tj+1
(by
Lemma
3,
(3)),
so
we
obtain:
<
(cd),
(cd),
(ab),
(ab)
>
By
Lemma
7A
below,
we
may
assume
that
b
=
c.
Then
applying
Lemma
3,
(2),
with
1,
2,
3
replaced
by
d,
c,
a,
respectively,
we
have
<
(cd),
(cd),
(ac),
(ac)

∼
<

(cd),
(ad),

Repeating
this
procedure
proves
the
claim.
§2.7.
Lemma
A
:
Suppose
in
the
above
situation
(except
that
q
might
be
one)
that
we
have
a

ti

=
(ab)
with
i
≡
N
+
1
(mod
2),
and
a,
b

,
a
=
b.
Then
we
may
move
to
the
same
situation,
except
with
a
=
1k
,
b
=
2k

Proof:
We
may
assume
that
with
respect
to
the
ordering
1k

.
.,
we
have
a

By
moving
around
chunks
of

that
commute
with
each

we
may
assume
that
i
=

and
we

we

By

we

Applying

Lemma
B
:
In
the
above
situation,
suppose
that
we
have
a
pair
ti
=

(where
i
≡
N
+
1
(mod

with
a
∈
Δk
and
b
∈
Δl
,
where
k
=
l.
Then
we
may
assume
that
a
=
1k
,
b
=
1l
.
Proof:
Same
as
for
Lemma
A.
§2.8.
By
Lemma
7B
and
the
claim
at
the
end
of
§2.6,
if
q
=
1,
then
we
may
assume
that
every
ti
(for
i
>
N
)
is
of
the
form
(1k
1l
)
for
k
=
l.
If
q
=
1,
then
Δ1
=
{1,
.
.
.
,
d}
and
we
may
assume
that
every
ti
(for
i
>
N
)
is
of
the
form
(11
21
).
Thus
if
q
=
1,
we
have
found
a
standard
normalizing
form
for
t,
so
the
Proposition
has
been
proved.
If
q
=
1,
then
we
note
that
if
we
regard
(1k
1l
)
as
an
element
of
the
permutation
group
of
the
symbols
Δ1
,
.
.
.
,
Δq
,
then
the
ti
’s
(for
i
>
N
)
act
transitively
on
the
Δj
’s
(since
all
the
ti
’s
together
act
transitively
on
{1,
.
.
.
,
d});
on
the
other
hand,
tN
+1
tN
+2
.
.
.
tb
=
(id).
(id)
Thus
we
are
in
the
situation
of
dealing
with
an
element
of
A(b−N
),q
.
But
the
Proposition
has
already
been
proven
in
this
case.
Thus
we
are
done.
§2.9.
For
ease
of
reference,
we
restate
the
main
result
of
this
section
as
a
Theorem:
Theorem
:
For
all
b,
d
∈
N
such
that
b
≥
3,
and
all
σ
∈
S
d
,
we
have
that
HU
S
b,d
;
σ
DHU
S
b,d
;
HRS
b,d
;
and
DHRS
σb,d
are
all
geometrically
irreducible
over
R.
§2.10.
We
now
turn
to
the
proof
of
another
similar
irreducibility
result
which
will
be
useful
later.
Let
us
recall
the
situation
of
of
§1.5:
C
α
β
−→
D
×
P1
⏐
⏐γ


⊇
CD
D
⏐
⏐

T
(Here
T
is
the
relevant
degenerate
b-pointed
stack.)
By
§4.3,
we
see
that
the
reduced
inverse
image
E
of
CD
via
β
is
étale
over
CD
∼
=
D.
(We
placed
this
Lemma
in
§4
in
which
it
is
more
in
context,
since
this
Section
is
concerned
primarily
with
combinatorics.)
Thus
E
→
T
is
an
étale
covering.
It
is
clear
that
the
portions
of
E
that
correspond
to
diﬀerent
ramiﬁcation
indices
form
diﬀerent
connected
components,
even
over
R.
In
fact,
we
have
the
following
result:
Proposition
:
The
geometric
(i.e.,
after
tensoring
from
R
up
to
C)
connected
components
of
E
are
in
one-to-one
correspondence
with
the
set
of
ramiﬁcation
indices
over
CD
,
which
is
the
same
as
the
set
of
cardinalities
of
domains
of
transitivity
of
σ,
where
D
=
DHU
S
σb,d
or
DHRS
σb,d
.
15
Proof:
As
before,
we
consider
the
action
of
braiding
elements
of
the
fundamental
group
of
T
on
the
set
B
corresponding
to
the
étale
covering
E
→
T
.
Simple
reﬂection
reveals
that
B
may
be
given
the
following
description:
B
consists
of
the
set
of
pairs
{(t1
,
.
.
.
,
tb−1
),
Δ}
where
(t1
,
.
.
.
,
tb−1
)
∈
Aτb−1,d
,
with
τ
conjugate
to
σ
and
Δ
a
domain
of
transitivity
of
τ
.
The
action
of
braiding
on
the
ﬁrst
b
−
1
factors
clearly
doesn’t
aﬀect
τ
,
and
acts
via
an
“elementary
move”
on
the
Aτb−1,d
part
and
trivially
on
Δ.
The
action
of
double
braiding
between
the
last
two
factors
clearly
takes
the
domain
of
transitivity
Δ
of
τ
to
the
domain
of
transitivity
tb−1
(Δ)
of
tb−1
τ
tb−1
.
By
Proposition
2,
we
can
take
any
given
element
of
B
to
an
element
with
tb−1
arbitrary
via
braiding
in
the
ﬁrst
b
−
1
factors.
By
doing
this
and
then
double
braiding
in
the
last
two
factors,
it
is
thus
clear
that
we
can
take
any
domain
of
transitivity
Δ
of
τ
to
any
other
domain
of
transitivity
of
τ
with
the
same
cardinality.
This
completes
the
proof.
§3.
Log
Admissible
Coverings
§3.1.
In
this
paper,
we
will
be
interested
in
studying
not
only
the
various
Hurwitz
stacks
introduced
in
§1,
but
also
their
compactiﬁcations.
In
[19],
a
deﬁnition
of
an
“admissible
covering”
is
proposed
as
a
means
of
compactifying
the
Hurwitz
scheme
HROb,d
.
Unfortunately,
since
Harris-Mumford
are
interested
only
in
the
coarse
moduli
scheme
of
such
admissible
coverings,
their
deﬁnition
of
an
admissible
covering
is
not
well
suited
to
the
study
of
families
and
the
construction
of
an
algebraic
stack
of
admissible
coverings.
The
main
reason
for
this
is
that
the
natural
context
in
which
to
study
such
admissible
coverings
is
not
the
category
of
schemes,
but
rather
that
of
log
schemes,
as
deﬁned
by
Kato
in
[21].
Thus,
in
this
Section,
we
propose
to
give
a
foundational
treatment
of
log
admissible
coverings.
In
particular,
we
prove
a
rather
general
existence
theorem
for
a
log
algebraic
stack
of
such
coverings.
If
we
forget
the
log
structure
of
this
log
algebraic
stack,
and
consider
the
associated
coarse
moduli
space
(as
in
[11],
Theorem
4.10),
we
recover
the
coarse
moduli
scheme
of
Harris-Mumford.
Remark:
In
an
earlier
version
of
this
paper,
we
referred
to
the
proof
of
[19]
in
our
construction
of
a
moduli
stack
of
admissible
coverings.
Indeed,
the
existence
of
such
an
algebraic
moduli
stack
is
essentially
a
formal
consequence
of
what
[19]
claim
to
have
proven.
However,
various
people
who
read
that
earlier
version
complained
bitterly
that
they
could
not
follow
the
proof
in
[19].
Upon
closer
inspection,
the
author
discovered
a
counterexample
to
one
of
the
key
claims
in
the
proof
of
the
existence
of
a
coarse
moduli
scheme
in
[19]
(see
§3D
below
for
more
details).
Thus,
it
seems
that
at
this
point,
one
must
consider
the
proof
of
this
result
in
[19]
to
be
incomplete.
In
light
of
this
situation,
the
author
decided
that
it
would
be
best
to
give
a
detailed
treatment
of
the
existence
of
an
algebraic
moduli
stack
of
admissible
coverings
that
is
independent
of
what
is
done
in
[19].

§3A.
Basic
Deﬁnitions
§3.2.
We
start
by
reviewing
Knudsen’s
notion
of
an
r-pointed
stable
curve.
Let
S
be
a
scheme.
Deﬁnition:
A
ﬂat,
proper
morphism
f
:
C
→
S
of
schemes
together
with
r
sections
σ1
,
.
.
.
,
σr
:
S
→
C
is
called
an
r-pointed
stable
curve
of
genus
g
if
(1)
the
geometric
ﬁbres
Cs
of
f
are
connected,
reduced,
of
dimension
1,
have
dimk(s)
H
1
(Cs
,
OCs
)
=
g,
and
have
at
most
ordinary
double
points
as
singularities;
(2)
the
images
of
the
sections
σ1
,
.
.
.
,
σr
are
disjoint
and
land
in
the
smooth
locus
of
f
;
(3)
the
relative
dualizing
sheaf
ωC/S
is
relatively
ample
with
respect
to
f
.
We
shall
refer
to
the
sections
σ1
,
.
.
.
,
σr
as
the
marked
points
of
f
:
C
→
S,
and
to
the
divisor
in
C
deﬁned
by
the
union
of
the
σi
as
the
divisor
of
marked
points.
Note
that
the
ampleness
condition
(3)
implies
that
2g
−
2
+
r
≥
1.
[22]
shows
that
there
exists
a
smooth,
proper
(over
Z)
moduli
stack
for
such
data,
which
we
shall
denote
by
Mg,r
.
Those
r-pointed
stable
curves
for
which
C
→
S
is
smooth
deﬁne
an
open
substack
Mg,r
⊆
Mg,r
.
The
complement
of
Mg,r
in
Mg,r
is
a
divisor
with
normal
crossings.
We
shall
call
this
divisor
the
divisor
at
inﬁnity
of
Mg,r
.
We
shall
often
ﬁnd
it
convenient
to
use
the
language
of
log
structures
and
log
schemes
of
[21].
A
log
structure
on
S
consists
of
an
étale
monoid
M
on
S,
together
with
a
morphism
M
→
OS
of
monoids
that
satisﬁes
certain
properties.
See
[21]
for
more
details.
We
shall
write
the
monoid
operation
on
sections
of
M
additively,
and
refer
to
the
given
morphism
M
→
OS
as
the
exponential
map
of
the
log
structure.
The
divisor
at
inﬁnity
of
Mg,r
thus
deﬁnes
(as
in
[21],
§1.5,
(1))
a
log
structure
on
Mg,r
which
we
shall
call
the
canonical
log
structure
on
Mg,r
.
We
shall
denote
the
resulting
log
log
stack
by
Mg,r
.
Let
MMg,r
denote
the
étale
monoid
that
deﬁnes
the
canonical
log
structure
on
Mg,r
.
Thus
MMg,r
is
precisely
the
subsheaf
of
OMg,r
consisting
of
functions
invertible
on
Mg,r
.
Let
GMg,r
⊆
MMg,r
×
be
the
subsheaf
of
functions
whose
zero
locus
is
smooth
(over
Z).
Thus,
OM
×
and
OM
g,r
×
acts
freely
on
GMg,r
.
Let
NMg,r
be
the
quotient
MMg,r
/OM
g,r
17
g,r
⊆
GMg,r
,
.
Then
×
ΓMg,r
=
GMg,r
/OM
def
g,r
⊆
NMg,r
is
a
constructible
sheaf
of
sets
(in
the
étale
topology).
Finally,
note
that
GMg,r
generates
the
sheaf
of
monoids
MMg,r
.
Let
(C
→
Mg,r
;
σ1
,
.
.
.
,
σr
:
Mg,r
→
C)
denote
the
universal
r-pointed
stable
curve
of
genus
g.
It
is
shown
in
[22]
that
C
may
be
naturally
identiﬁed
with
Mg,r+1
.
Let
us
denote
by
C
log
the
log
stack
obtained
by
pulling
back
the
canonical
log
structure
on
Mg,r+1
relative
to
this
identiﬁcation.
We
shall
call
this
log
structure
on
C
the
canonical
log
structure
on
C.
Note
that
the
canonical
log
structure
on
C
can
also
be
obtained
as
the
log
structure
associated
to
the
divisor
with
normal
crossings
which
is
the
union
of
the
images
of
the
σi
,
together
with
the
pull-back
via
C
→
Mg,r
of
the
divisor
at
inﬁnity
of
Mg,r
.
Thus,
just
as
for
Mg,r
,
we
can
deﬁne
GC
⊆
MC
and
ΓC
=
GC
/OC×
⊆
NC
.
def
§3.3.
When
working
in
the
logarithmic
category,
the
following
notion
is
more
convenient
than
the
classical
notion
of
Knudsen
reviewed
above.
Let
S
log
be
a
ﬁne
log
scheme
(in
the
sense
of
[21],
§2.3).
log
Deﬁnition:
A
morphism
of
log
stacks
κlog
:
S
log
→
Mg,r
will
be
referred
to
as
the
data
for
an
r-pointed
stable
log-curve
of
genus
g.
For
such
a
κlog
,
let
C
log
→
S
log
be
the
log
pull-back
(in
the
logarithmic
category)
of
the
universal
object
C
log
→
Mg,r
by
means
of
κlog
.
Such
a
C
log
→
S
log
will
be
referred
to
as
an
r-pointed
stable
log-curve
of
genus
g.
Note
that
for
smooth
curves,
once
one
is
given
a
classifying
morphism
κ
:
S
→
Mg,r
,
log
the
resulting
log
morphism
κlog
:
S
log
→
Mg,r
is
uniquely
deﬁned,
so
smooth
curves
and
smooth
log-curves
are
equivalent
notions.
However,
if
κ
:
S
→
Mg,r
does
not
map
into
log
Mg,r
,
then
it
is
easy
to
construct
examples
of
distinct
log
morphisms
S
log
→
Mg,r
with
the
same
underlying
stack
morphism
κ
:
S
→
Mg,r
.
Nonetheless,
given
a
morphism
κ
:
S
→
Mg,r
,
there
always
exists
a
natural
choice
of
log
structure
on
S
for
which
κ
log
extends
to
a
logarithmic
morphism:
namely,
the
pull-back
of
the
log
structure
on
Mg,r
.
Now
let
C
log
→
S
log
be
an
r-pointed
stable
log-curve
of
genus
g.
Let
MC
(respectively,
MS
)
denote
the
étale
monoid
deﬁning
the
log
structure
of
C
log
(respectively,
S
log
).
Let
×
NC
(respectively,
NS
)
be
the
quotient
MC
/OC
(respectively,
MS
/OS×
).
Then
we
obtain
a
natural
morphism
from
ΓC
|C
(respectively,
ΓMg,r
|S
),
to
NC
(respectively,
NS
).
We
denote
the
image
of
this
morphism
by
ΓC
(respectively,
ΓS
).
Thus,
ΓC
(respectively,
ΓS
)
forms
a
subsheaf
(of
sets)
of
NC
(respectively,
NS
).
Let
GC
(respectively,
GS
)
be
the
inverse
image
of
ΓC
(respectively,
ΓS
)
in
MC
(respectively,
MS
)
via
the
projection
MC
→
NC
(respectively,
MS
→
NS
).
We
shall
call
ΓC
(respectively,
ΓS
;
GC
;
GS
)
the
sheaf
of
generators
of
NC
(respectively,
NS
;
MC
;
MS
).
Since
ΓC
is
a
constructible
sheaf
of
sets
on
C,
one
can
regard
(see
[28],
p.
160)
ΓC
as
a
quasi-ﬁnite
algebraic
space
over
S.
Then
GC
deﬁnes
an
OΓ×C
-torsor,
hence
a
line
bundle
LC
on
this
algebraic
space
ΓC
.
18
Finally,
by
forgetting
log
structures,
we
obtain
an
underlying
r-pointed
stable
curve
of
genus
g:
(f
:
C
→
S;
σ1
,
.
.
.
,
σr
:
S
→
C).
§3.4.
Sometimes
it
is
convenient
to
forget
the
ordering
on
the
marked
points
of
a
pointed
stable
curve.
That
is
to
say,
we
have
a
natural
action
of
S
r
(the
symmetric
group
log
on
r
letters)
on
Mg,r
given
by
permuting
the
marked
points.
If
we
form
the
quotient
of
log
log
Mg,r
by
S
r
(in
the
sense
of
stacks),
we
thus
obtain
a
log
stack
MS
g,r
.
Note
that
the
log
log
universal
log-curve
C
log
→
Mg,r
descends
to
a
log-curve
CS
log
→
MS
g,r
.
Let
S
log
be
a
ﬁne
log
scheme.
log
Deﬁnition:
A
morphism
of
log
stacks
κlog
:
S
log
→
MS
g,r
will
be
referred
to
as
the
data
for
a
symmetrically
r-pointed
stable
log-curve
of
genus
g.
For
such
a
κlog
,
let
C
log
→
S
log
log
be
the
pull-back
(in
the
logarithmic
category)
of
the
universal
object
CS
log
→
MS
g,r
by
means
of
κlog
.
Such
a
C
log
→
S
log
will
be
referred
to
as
a
symmetrically
r-pointed
stable
log-curve
of
genus
g.
If
we
forget
the
log
structures
of
such
a
log-curve,
the
resulting
(f
:
C
→
S;
μf
⊆
C)
(where
μf
⊆
C
is
the
divisor
of
marked
points)
will
be
referred
to
as
a
symmetrically
r-pointed
stable
curve
of
genus
g.
For
instance,
when
g
=
0,
the
open
substack
MS
g,r
⊆
MS
g,r
of
smooth
curves
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
stack
RS
b
of
§1.3.
§3.5.
We
are
now
ready
to
state
the
main
deﬁnition
of
this
Section.
Let
f
log
:
C
log
→
log
S
(respectively,
hlog
:
D
log
→
S
log
)
be
a
symmetrized
r-
(respectively,
s-)
pointed
stable
log-curve
of
genus
g
(respectively,
q).
Let
μf
⊆
C
(respectively,
μh
⊆
D)
be
the
divisor
of
marked
points.
Let
π
log
:
C
log
→
D
log
be
a
morphism
of
log
schemes.
Deﬁnition:
We
shall
say
that
π
log
:
C
log
→
D
log
is
a
log
admissible
covering
of
degree
d
if
the
following
conditions
are
satisﬁed:
(1)
π
log
is
log
étale
(in
the
sense
of
[21],
§3.3);
moreover,
the
morphism
π
−1
ND
→
NC
induced
by
the
morphism
of
log
structures
maps
ΓD
into
def
ΓdC
=
d

i
·
ΓC
i=1
(2)
π
is
ﬁnite;
(3)
π
is
of
degree
d
on
a
dense
open
set
of
every
ﬁber
of
h
:
D
→
S;
(4)
μf
⊆
π
−1
(μh
);
π
−1
(μh
)
⊆
d
·
μf
;
(5)
f
is
smooth
at
c
∈
C
if
and
only
if
h
is
smooth
at
π(c).
19
We
now
make
some
trivial
observations
concerning
log
admissible
coverings:
(1)
Of
the
above
conditions,
only
the
ﬁrst
depends
on
the
log
structures;
the
rest
depend
only
on
the
morphism
of
schemes
π.
(2)
Note
that
the
second
inclusion
in
condition
(4)
actually
follows
from
conditions
(1)
and
(5).
(3)
Let
x
∈
C
−
μf
be
a
point
at
which
f
is
smooth.
Let
y
=
π(x).
Then
the
log
structure
on
C
log
(respectively,
D
log
)
at
x
(respectively,
y)
is
just
the
pull-back
to
C
(respectively,
D)
of
the
log
structure
on
S
log
.
It
thus
follows
that
π
is
étale
at
x.
(4)
If
hlog
has
the
property
that
every
irreducible
component
of
every
geometric
ﬁber
Ds
of
h
is
smooth,
then
f
log
also
has
this
property.
§3.6.
Suppose
that
now
that
(f
:
C
→
S,
μf
⊆
C)
and
(h
:
D
→
S,
μh
⊆
D)
are
symmetrically
pointed
stable
curves.
Then
we
make
the
following
deﬁnition
Deﬁnition:
A
morphism
π
:
C
→
D
will
be
called
an
admissible
covering
if
there
exist,
étale
locally
on
S:
(1)
a
ﬁne
log
scheme
S
log
with
underlying
scheme
S;
(2)
symmetrically
pointed
stable
log-curves
C
log
→
S
log
and
D
log
→
S
log
whose
underlying
symmetrically
pointed
stable
curves
are
(f
:
C
→
S,
μf
⊆
C)
and
(h
:
D
→
S,
μh
⊆
D);
(3)
a
log
admissible
covering
π
log
:
C
log
→
D
log
whose
underlying
scheme
morphism
is
π
Remark:
We
shall
see
below
that
when
D
→
S
is
of
genus
zero,
the
deﬁnition
agrees
with
that
of
[19],
p.
57.
The
reason
that
we
prefer
this
deﬁnition
is
that
when
considering
moduli
of
morphisms
of
curves,
it
is
very
diﬃcult
to
incorporate
conditions
that
involve
the
existence
of
certain
local
functions
on
the
curves
(as
do
the
conditions
given
in
[19],
p.
57).
Since
a
log
structure
essentially
involves
some
sort
of
complicated
monoid-worth
of
global
(on
the
curve)
line
bundles,
a
morphism
of
log
structures
amounts
to
some
sort
of
morphism
of
line
bundles,
hence
(as
we
shall
see
below)
is
relatively
easy
to
consider
the
moduli
of.
On
the
other
hand,
one
draw-back
of
the
above
deﬁnition
of
an
admissible
covering
is
that
the
log
structure
on
S
is
not
uniquely
or
canonically
deﬁned.
Nonetheless,
we
shall
see
below
a
posteriori
that,
in
fact,
there
does
always
exist
a
canonical
log
structure
on
S
with
respect
to
which
an
admissible
covering
π
extends
to
a
log
admissible
covering.

§3B.
First
Properties
§3.7.
Let
A
be
a
local
noetherian
henselian
ring.
Let
s
∈
mA
(the
maximal
ideal
of
A).
Let
R
be
the
henselization
of
A[X,
Y
]/(XY
−
s)
(where
X
and
Y
are
indeterminates)
at
the
ideal
generated
by
mA
,
X,
and
Y
.
Thus,
R
is
a
local
noetherian
henselian
ring,
with
maximal
ideal
mR
.
Let
x,
y
∈
R
be
the
images
of
X
and
Y
,
respectively.
Then
we
have
the
following
Lemma:
Suppose
that
we
are
given
x
,
y

∈
R;
s
∈
A
such
that
x
y

=
s
,
and
(x,
y,
mA
)
=
(x
,
y

,
mA
)
(equality
of
ideals
in
R).
Then
there
exist
units
ux
,
uy
∈
R×
with
ux
uy
∈
A×
such
that
either
ux
x
=
x
and
uy
y
=
y

,
or
ux
x
=
y

and
uy
y
=
x
.
Proof:
Let
us
ﬁrst
consider
the
case
when
s
=
0.
Then
the
Lemma
follows
immediately
from
the
simple
structure
of
the
ring
A[[X,
Y
]]/(XY
),
and
faithfully
ﬂat
descent
from
A[[X,
Y
]]/(XY
)
down
to
R.
Now
let
us
return
to
the
case
of
arbitrary
s.
By
considering
the
ring
R/sR
=
A/sA[[X,
Y
]]/(XY
)
(and
applying
the
Lemma
to
this
ring),
it
thus
follows
that
s
∈
(s).
Moreover,
without
loss
of
generality,
we
may
assume
that
x
=
x
+
s
·
φ
and
y

=
y
+
s
·
ψ,
for
some
φ,
ψ
∈
R.
By
multiplying
x
and
y

,
we
thus
obtain
that
s
is
equal
to
s
times
a
unit
in
R.
Since
R
is
faithfully
ﬂat
over
A,
it
follows
that
s
is
equal
to
s
times
a
unit
in
A.
Thus,
without
loss
of
generality,
we
may
assume
that
s
=
s.
Let
R
(respectively,
A
)
be
the
completion
of
R
of
(respectively,
A).
If
we
restrict
ourselves
to
ﬁnding
ux
and
uy
such
that
ux
uy
=
1,
then
it
follows
from
the
deﬁnition
of
“henselization,”
that
it
suﬃces
to
prove
the
Lemma
with
R
and
A
replaced
by
R
and
A
,
respectively.
Let
us
review
our
situation:
We
have
x
,
y

∈
R
such
that
x
y

=
s
and
(x
,
y

,
mA
)
=
(x,
y,
mA
).
Suppose
we
know
that
x
=
x
+
si
f
;
y

=
y
+
si
g,
for
some
f,
g
∈
R
,
and
some
positive
integer
i.
By
multiplying
x
and
y

,
we
obtain
that
x(si
g)
+
y(si
f
)
∈
si+1
R
.
Thus,
x
+
y
annihilates
the
image
of
x(si
g)
≡
−y(si
f
)
in
si
R
/si+1
R
.
Since
x
+
y
is
a
regular
element
of
R
,
we
thus
obtain
that
xsi
g
≡
ysi
f
≡
0.
On
the
other
hand,
from
the
structure
of
the
module
si
R
/si+1
R
=
si
A
/si+1
A
[[X,
Y
]]/(XY
),
one
then
obtains
that
si
f
−
si
xα,
si
g
−
si
yβ
∈
(si+1
),
for
some
α,
β
∈
R
such
that
α
(respectively,
β)
is
a
power
series
in
x
(respectively,
y).
Now
let
us
note
that
we
can
always
make
substitutions
of
the
following
sort:
replace
x
by
x
·
u−1
,
and
y

by
y

·
u
(for
some
unit
u
∈
(R
)×
),
without
aﬀecting
the
validity
of
the
Lemma.
Moreover,
if
we
make
such
a
substitution,
with
u
=
1
+
si
α
−
si
β,
we
ﬁnd
ourselves
in
the
situation
reviewed
at
the
beginning
of
this
paragraph,
except
with
i
replaced
by
i
+
1.
By
induction
(and
the
fact
that
R
is
complete
and
separated
in
the
s-adic
topology),
this
completes
the
proof
of
the
Lemma.
§3.8.
We
continue
with
the
notation
of
the
previous
§.
Lemma:
Suppose
that
there
exist
units
ux
,
uy
∈
R×
such
that
xux
=
x,
yuy
=
y,
and
ux
uy
∈
A×
.
Then
it
follows
that
ux
=
uy
=
1.
Proof:
As
in
the
previous
§,
we
prove
the
Lemma
with
R
and
A
replaced
by
their
completions
R
and
A
.
Suppose
that
we
know
that
ux
≡
1,
uy
≡
1
modulo
si
R
,
21
for
some
nonnegative
integer
i.
Let
dx
=
1
−
ux
;
dy
=
1
−
uy
.
Since
xdx
=
0,
ydy
=
0,
it
follows
that
we
can
write
dx
(mod
si+1
R
)
(respectively,
dy
(mod
si+1
R
))
as
a
power
series
in
positive
powers
of
y
(respectively,
x)
with
coeﬃcients
in
si
A
/si+1
A
.
Moreover,
dx
dy
=
1
−
ux
−
uy
+
ux
uy
=
dx
+
dy
+
(ux
uy
−
1).
It
thus
follows
that
(ux
uy
−
1)
∈
A
si
R
=
si
A
,
hence
that
dx
+
dy
∈
si
A
+
si+1
R
.
But
from
the
representation
of
dx
(mod
si+1
R
)
and
dy
(mod
si+1
R
)
as
power
series
of
the
form
just
described,
it
thus
follows
that
dx
,
dy
∈
si+1
R
.
By
induction
(and
the
fact
that
R
is
complete
and
separated
in
the
s-adic
topology),
this
completes
the
proof
of
the
Lemma.
§3.9.
We
now
consider
a
slightly
diﬀerent
deﬁnition
of
an
“admissible
covering,”
which
is
essentially
the
same
as
that
of
[19].
Let
S
be
a
scheme.
Let
(f
:
C
→
S,
μf
⊆
C)
and
(h
:
D
→
S,
μh
⊆
D)
be
symmetrically
pointed
stable
curves.
Then
we
make
the
following
deﬁnition
Deﬁnition:
A
morphism
π
:
C
→
D
will
be
called
an
HM-admissible
covering
if
it
satisﬁes
conditions
(2)
through
(5)
of
the
deﬁnition
of
a
log
admissible
covering,
as
well
as
the
following
condition,
consisting
of
two
parts,
which
we
refer
to
together
as
“condition
(1
)”:
π
is
étale,
except:
(1
A)
over
μh
,
where
it
exhibits
tame
ramiﬁcation
(1
B)
over
the
singular
points:
if
s
∈
S,
λ
is
a
node
of
Cs
,
and
ν
=
π(λ),
then
sh
sh
there
exist
a
∈
msh
S,s
,
x,
y
∈
mC,λ
,
and
u,
v
∈
mD,ν
,
such
that
xy
=
a,
e
e
e
uv
=
a
,
u
=
x
,
v
=
y
(for
some
natural
number
e
(necessarily
×
)
and
such
that
x,
y
(respectively,
u,
v)
less
than
d)
such
that
e
∈
OS,s
sh
sh
generate
mf
−1
(s),λ
(respectively,
msh
h−1
(s),ν
).
Here,
by
“m
,”
we
mean
the
maximal
ideal
of
“O
sh
,”
the
strict
henselization
of
the
local
ring
in
question.
Remark
1:
Suppose
that
condition
(1
B)
is
satisﬁed.
Then
let
us
assume
that
we
are

sh



given
elements
u
,
v

∈
msh
D,π(c)
and
b
∈
mS,s
that
satisfy
u
v
=
b
and
that
generate


sh

sh
msh
h−1
(s),d
.
Then
we
claim
that
there
exist
x
,
y
∈
mC,c
,
together
with
a
∈
mS,s
that
satisfy
(x
)e
=
u
;
(y

)e
=
v

;
x
y

=
a
.
Indeed,
this
follows
from
the
fact
that
the
unordered
pair
(u
,
v

)
diﬀers
from
the
unordered
pair
(u,
v)
by
multiplication
by
units
(Lemma
7).
Taking
eth
roots
of
these
units
(which
is
possible
precisely
because
we
are
working
in
the
strict
henselizations),
then
multiplying
by
the
original
x,
y,
and
a
proves
the
claim.
Remark
2:
Note
that
unlike
in
[19],
p.
57,
in
condition
(1
B)
above,
we
use
strict
henselizations
rather
than
completions.
The
main
reason
for
this
is
that
strict
henselizations
are
often
technically
easier
to
work
with.
Moreover,
whether
one
uses
strict
henselizations
or
completions
of
strict
henselizations
(i.e.,
one
wants
the
residue
ﬁeld
to
be
separably
closed)
22
in
condition
(1
B)
makes
no
diﬀerence.
Indeed,
this
follows
immediately
from
the
argument
of
the
preceding
Remark:
i.e.,
whether
or
not
condition
(1
B)
holds
is
independent
of
which
u,
v,
and
b
one
chooses
downstairs;
thus,
if
one
knows
that
a
“good”
set
of
u,
v,
and
b
exist
once
one
passes
to
the
completion
of
the
strict
henselization,
then
it
follows
that
a
“good”
set
already
exists
in
the
strict
henselization.
§3.10.
We
retain
the
notations
of
the
preceding
§.
Let
π
:
C
→
D
be
an
HMadmissible
covering.
We
would
now
like
to
deﬁne
a
canonical
log
structure
on
S
(determined
completely
by
π),
over
which
π
will
extend
to
a
log
admissible
covering
π
log
.
First
let
us
denote
by
MSup
(respectively,
MSdn
)
the
monoid
which
forms
the
log
structure
on
S
obtained
log
log
by
pulling
back
that
of
MS
g,r
(respectively,
MS
q,s
)
via
the
classifying
morphism
for
dn
(f
:
C
→
S,
μf
)
(respectively,
(h
:
D
→
S,
μh
)
).
Let
MCup
(respectively,
MD
)
denote
the
monoid
which
forms
the
log
structure
on
C
(respectively,
D)
obtained
by
pulling
back
that
of
the
universal
symmetric
stable
log-curve.
Next
let
us
focus
attention
at
a
node
λ
∈
Cs
.
Let
ν
=
π(λ).
Let
us
suppose
that
we
have
x,
y,
u,
v,
a,
e
as
in
Condition
(1
B)
above.
Let
b
=
ae
,
so
uv
=
b.
Let
us
choose
sections
(in
an
étale
neighborhood
of
λ)
log(x),
log(y)
of
MCup
,
and
a
section
log(a)
of
MSup
such
that
log(x)
+
log(y)
=
log(a),
and
such
that
under
the
exponential
map,
log(x),
log(y),
and
log(a)
map
to
x,
y,
and
a,
respectively.
Note
that
by
Lemma
8,
these
properties
determine
log(x),
log(y),
and
log(a)
(as
a
triple)
uniquely.
Similarly,
we
choose
sections
log(u),
log(v),
and
log(b).
We
would
like
to
deﬁne
a
new
log
structure,
whose
monoid
we
denote
by
MS
,
on
S.
To
do
this,
we
note
that,
étale
locally
on
S
near
s,
the
log
structure
MSup
(respectively,
MSdn
)
has
a
chart
(in
the
sense
of
[21],
§2.9)
whose
generators
are
indexed
by
the
nodes
on
Cs
(respectively,
Ds
).
More
concretely,
we
may
take,
for
the
generator
indexed
by
the
node
λ
(respectively,
ν),
the
element
log(a)
(respectively,
log(b))
just
deﬁned.
We
then
deﬁne
MS
to
be
the
log
structure
associated
to
the
following
quotient
monoid:
(MSup
×
MSdn
)/
∼
where
the
equivalence
relation
“∼”
is
that
generated
by
requiring
that
(0,
log(b))
∼
(e
·
log(a),
0).
By
Lemmas
7
and
8,
everything
that
we
are
doing
is
canonical,
so
even
though
we
deﬁned
MS
étale
locally
on
S,
(the
log
structure
deﬁned
by)
MS
descends
to
our
original
S.
This
completes
the
construction
of
MS
.
Note
that
we
have
canonical
morphisms
MSup
→
MS
and
MSdn
→
MS
.
Now
let
us
denote
by
(C,
MC
)
(respectively,
(D,
MD
))
the
log
scheme
obtained
as
the
dn
)
×(S,M
dn
)
(S,
MS
)).
We
ﬁber
product
(C,
MCup
)
×(S,MSup
)
(S,
MS
)
(respectively,
(D,
MD
S
would
like
to
extend
the
morphism
π
to
a
morphism
of
log
schemes
π
log
:
(C,
MC
)
→
(D,
MD
)
over
(S,
MS
)
which
is
a
log
admissible
covering.
We
do
this
as
follows.
First
note
that
away
from
the
nodes,
π
extends
naturally
to
π
log
since
the
only
substantive
part
(i.e.,
not
pulled
23
back
from
S)
of
the
log
structure
is
constituted
by
the
divisors
of
marked
points,
which
are
carried
to
each
other
(by
the
deﬁnition
of
an
HM-admissible
covering).
Moreover,
away
from
the
nodes,
the
log
morphism
π
log
that
we
obtain
is
log
étale,
by
condition
(1
A)
of
the
deﬁnition
of
an
HM-admissible
covering.
Thus,
it
remains
to
deal
with
the
nodes.
We
can
work
étale
locally,
as
long
as
we
do
things
canonically.
Thus,
we
focus
attention
at
a
node
λ
of
Cs
,
as
above.
Then
the
portion
of
the
log
structure
of
MD
that
does
not
come
from
MS
is
generated
(in
a
neighborhood
of
ν)
by
log(u)
and
log(v).
Thus,
it
suﬃces
to
specify
what
happens
to
log(u)
and
log(v)
under
(π
log
)−1
,
and
to
check
that
what
we
specify
satisﬁes
the
relevant
relations.
We
do
this
as
follows:
we
send
log(u)
to
e
·
log(x)
and
log(v)
to
e
·
log(y).
The
only
relation
to
be
checked
is
log(u)
+
log(v)
=
log(b),
but
this
is
clearly
preserved
(by
the
deﬁnition
of
MS
!).
By
Lemmas
7
and
8,
everything
is
canonical,
so
this
morphism
MD
→
MC
descends
to
C.
Moreover,
by
[21],
Theorem
3.5,
it
is
clear
that
the
morphism
MD
→
MC
thus
deﬁned
is
log
étale.
Finally,
since
e
≤
d,
it
follows
that
the
log
morphism
π
log
:
(C,
MC
)
→
(D,
MD
)
satisﬁes
condition
(1)
of
the
deﬁnition
of
a
log
admissible
covering.
§3.11.
We
summarize
the
above
discussion
as
follows.
Deﬁnition:
We
shall
call
the
log
structure
MS
on
S
the
canonical
log
structure
associated
to
the
(HM-)admissible
covering
π.
Proposition:
A
morphism
π
:
C
→
D
between
symmetrically
pointed
stable
curves
(f
:
C
→
S,
μf
⊆
C)
and
(h
:
D
→
S,
μh
⊆
D)
is
an
HM-admissible
covering
if
and
only
if
it
is
an
admissible
covering
in
the
sense
of
Deﬁnition
6.
Proof:
We
have
just
shown
the
(nontrivial)
“only
if”
part.
The
“if”
part
is
trivial:
it
follows
immediately
by
writing
out
condition
(1)
of
the
deﬁnition
of
a
log
admissible
covering,
i.e.,
what
it
means
to
have
a
log
étale
morphism.
§3.12.
Before
going
on
to
the
next
subsection,
we
would
like
to
consider
brieﬂy
how
admissible
coverings
behave
over
discrete
valuation
rings.
Let
S
=
Spec(A),
where
A
is
a
strict
henselian
discrete
valuation
ring.
Lemma:
Let
A
be
a
strict
henselian
discrete
valuation
ring
such
that
n
∈
A×
.
Let
s
∈
A
be
a
uniformizer.
For
each
natural
number
i
≥
1,
let
Ri
be
the
strict
henselization
of
A[X,
Y
]/(XY
−
si
)
at
the
maximal
ideal
m
=
(x,
y,
s)
(where
x,
y
are
the
images
of
X,
Y
in
Rn
).
(Here
X
and
Y
are
indeterminates.)
Let
Wi
=
Spec(Ri
)
−
{m}.
Then
π1
(Wn
)
∼
=
Z/nZ,
and
the
universal
cover
Wn∼
of
Wn
is
W1
with
the
map
Wn∼
→
Wn
induced
by
mapping
x
to
xn
and
y
to
y
n
.
Proof:
The
map
W1
→
Wn
is
clearly
ﬁnite
étale
with
W1
connected.
On
the
other
hand,
R1
is
a
regular
local
ring,
so
π1
(W1
)
is
trivial.
The
lemma
follows.
§3.13.
We
continue
with
the
notations
of
the
preceding
§.
Let
(f
:
C
→
S,
μf
⊆
C)
and
(h
:
D
→
S,
μh
⊆
D)
be
symmetrically
pointed
stable
curves
over
S
that
are
smooth
over
the
generic
point
η
of
S.
Let
πη
:
Cη
→
Dη
be
an
admissible
covering
over
η.
Then
24
Lemma:
There
is
at
most
one
extension
of
πη
to
an
admissible
covering
π
:
C
→
D
over
S.
If
d!
∈
A×
,
then
(after
possibly
replacing
A
by
a
tamely
ramiﬁed
extension)
there
exists
an
admissible
covering
π
:
C
→
D
that
extends
πη
.
Proof:
The
uniqueness
statement
follows
immediately
from
the
fact
that
Cη
is
schematically
dense
in
C.
Now
we
consider
existence:
Let
C

→
S
be
the
normalization
of
D
in
Cη
.
By
Abhyankar’s
lemma,
we
may,
after
possibly
replacing
A
by
a
tamely
ramiﬁed
extension,
assume
that
C

→
D
is
not
ramiﬁed
over
the
generic
points
of
the
special
ﬁbre
of
D.
By
purity
of
the
branch
locus,
the
only
places
where
C

→
D
might
not
be
étale
are
over
μh
and
over
the
singular
points
of
Ds
(where
s,
as
usual,
is
the
special
point
of
S).
By
Abhyankar’s
lemma
(and
the
fact
that
d!
∈
A×
),
we
have
tame
ramiﬁcation
over
μh
,
so
we
need
only
deal
with
the
singular
points
of
Ds
.
But
at
the
singular
points,
it
follows
from
the
Lemma
of
the
preceding
§
that
C

→
D
extends
to
an
admissible
covering,
and
C

=
C.

§3.14.
Let
S
be
a
noetherian
scheme.
Let
f
:
X
→
S
be
a
ﬂat,
proper
morphism.
Let
L
be
a
relatively
ample
line
bundle
on
X.
Then
we
have
the
following
Lemma:
Let
φ
:
F
→
G
be
a
morphism
of
coherent
sheaves
on
X.
Suppose
that
G
is
ﬂat
over
S.
Then
there
exists
a
unique
closed
subscheme
Z
⊆
S
such
that
for
every
morphism
T
→
S,
we
have
φT
=
0
(where
the
subscript
denotes
the
result
of
base-changing
from
S
to
T
)
if
and
only
if
the
morphism
T
→
S
factors
through
Z.
Proof:
By
uniqueness,
it
suﬃces
to
prove
the
Lemma
Zariski
locally
on
S.
Then
there
exists
an
n
such
that
F(n)
(where
F(n)
=
F
⊗OX
L⊗n
)
is
generated
by
global
sections.
Thus,
it
suﬃces
to
prove
the
Lemma
in
the
case
F
=
OX
.
Moreover,
if
n
is
suﬃciently
large,
then
f∗
OX
(n)
and
f∗
G(n)
are
vector
bundles
on
S.
Let
α
:
f∗
OX
(n)
→
f∗
G(n)
be
the
morphism
of
vector
bundles
induced
by
twisting,
then
pushing
forward
φ.
Let
Z
be
the
zero
locus
of
α.
Then
Z
has
the
property
asserted
in
the
statement
of
the
Lemma.
Corollary:
Let
F
and
G
be
closed
subschemes
of
X,
and
suppose
that
F
is
ﬂat
over
S.
Then
there
exists
a
closed
subscheme
Z
⊆

such
that
for

we
have
FT

GT
(where
the

the
result
of
base-changing
from

)
if
and
only
if
the
morphism
T

S
factors
through
Z.
Proof:
Apply
the
above
Lemma
to
the
morphism
J

OF
,
where
G
=
V
(J
).
§3.15.
Suppose
now
that
(f
:
C
→
S,
μf
⊆
C)
and
(h
:
D
→
S,
μh
⊆
D)
are
symmetrically
pointed
stable
curves.
Suppose
that
we
are
given
an
S-morphism
π
:
C
→
D.
25
Lemma:
There
exists
a
unique
subscheme
Z
⊆
S
such
that
for
any
morphism
T
→
S,
πT
:
CT
→
DT
satisﬁes
conditions
(2),
(3),
and
(4)
of
the
deﬁnition
of
a
log
admissible
morphism
if
and
only
if
T
→
S
factors
through
Z.
Proof:
For
ﬁniteness
(condition
(2)),
one
notes
that
there
exists
a
closed
set
H
⊆
C
such
that
π
restricted
to
C
−
H
is
quasi-ﬁnite,
while
for
x
∈
H,
the
dimension
of
π
−1
π(x)
at
x
is
nonzero.
Then
taking
Z2
=
S
−
f
(H)
(which
is
open
in
S)
takes
care
of
condition
(2).
Thus,
we
may
assume
that
π
is
ﬁnite.
Note
that
it
then
follows
(by
the
local
criterion
for
ﬂatness)
that
π
is
ﬂat
over
the
smooth
locus
of
h
:
D
→
S.
Then
let
us
take
a
collection
of
nonintersecting
sections
ρ1
,
.
.
.
,
ρN
of
h
:
D
→
S
at
whose
images
h
is
smooth
and
such
that
every
irreducible
component
of
every
ﬁber
of
h
has
a
ρi
passing
through
it
(note
that
def
one
can
always
ﬁnd
such
ρi
étale
locally
on
S).
Then
Ki
=
C
×D,π,ρi
S
is
ﬁnite
and
ﬂat
over
S.
Moreover,
condition
(3)
is
equivalent
to
the
condition
that
all
the
Ki
be
of
degree
d
over
S.
Thus,
taking
the
open
subscheme
Z3
⊆
S
over
which
all
the
Ki
have
degree
d
takes
care
of
condition
(3).
Finally,
we
can
take
care
of
Condition
(4)
by
means
of
Corollary
14
(in
the
previous
§).
§3.16.
Suppose
now
that
(f
:
C
→
S,
μf
⊆
C)
and
(h
:
D
→
S,
μh
⊆
D)
are
symmetrically
pointed
stable
curves,
and
that
we
are
given
an
S-morphism
π
:
C
→
D
satisfying
conditions
(2),
(3),
and
(4),
of
the
deﬁnition
of
a
log
admissible
covering.
Now
let
us
note
that
the
fact
that
condition
(4)
is
satisﬁed
means
that
π
automatically
extends
uniquely
to
a
log
morphism
π
log
over
the
smooth
locus
of
h
:
D
→
S,
for
any
choice
of
log
structure
on
S.
Thus,
we
can
consider
the
morphism
dπ
:
π
∗
ΩD/S
(μh
)
→
ΩC/S
(μf
)
of
diﬀerentials
with
logarithmic
poles
at
the
marked
points.
Let
us
denote
by
ωC/S
the
relative
dualizing
sheaf
of
C
over
S.
Note
that
ωC/S
(μf
)
is
naturally
isomorphic
to
ΩC
log
/S
log
.
Indeed,
this
follows
immediately
from
computing
dualizing
sheaves
in
the
universal
case
C
→
Mg,r
.
Thus,
we
have
a
natural
morphism
ΩC/S
(μf
)
→
ΩC
log
/S
log
=
ωC/S
(μf
)
which
is
an
isomorphism
outside
the
singular
locus
of
f
:
C
→
S.
In
other
words,
if
we
denote
the
zero
set
of
this
natural
morphism
by
C
sing
,
then
C
sing
⊆
C
is
a
closed
subscheme,
and
C
−
C
sing
⊆
C
is
precisely
the
open
set
of
points
at
which
f
:
C
→
S
is
smooth.
Since
the
smooth
locus
of
f
:
C
→
S
is
schematically
dense
in
C,
it
follows
that
if
there
exists
a
morphism
ψ
:
π
∗
ωD/S
(μh
)
→
ωC/S
(μf
)
that
extends
dπ
then
it
is
unique.
We
shall
refer
to
an
isomorphism
ψ
:
π
∗
ωD/S
(μh
)
→
ωC/S
(μf
)
that
extends
dπ
as
a
log
extension
of
dπ.
Lemma:
There
exists
a
unique
subscheme
Z
⊆
S
such
that
for
any
T
→
S,
dπT
admits
a
log
extension
if
and
only
if
T
→
S
passes
through
Z.
26
Proof:
Let
Z1
⊆
S
be
the
subscheme
such
that
for
any
T
→
S,
(π
∗
ωD/S
(μh
))|T
∼
=
(ωC/S
(μf
))|T
⊗OT
N
(for
some
line
bundle
N
on
T
)
if
and
only
if
T
→
S
factors
through
Z1
.
(See
[3],
Theorem
7.3,
for
the
existence
of
such
a
Z1
.)
By
restricting
to
Z1
,
we
may
assume
that
π
∗
ωD/S
(μh
)
and
ωC/S
(μf
)
are
already
isomorphic.
Let
ρ
:
S
→
C
be
a
section
such
that
f
is
smooth
at
ρ,
and
h
is
smooth
at
π
◦
ρ.
By
passing
to
an
open
subset
of
S,
we
may
assume
that
ρ∗
(dπ)
is
an
isomorphism.
Let
ψ
be
that
isomorphism
of
π
∗
ωD/S
(μh
)
and
ωC/S
(μf
)
whose
restriction
to
ρ
is
equal
to
ρ∗
(dπ).
The
fact
that
there
exists
a
Z
as
asserted
in
the
statement
of
the
Lemma
then
follows
from
applying
Lemma
14
to
the
diﬀerence
of
the
two
morphisms
π
∗
ΩD/S
(μh
)
→
ωC/S
(μf
)
(one
obtained
from
dπ,
the
other
from
ψ).
Suppose
that
dπ
admits
a
log
extension.
Then
it
follows
immediately
from
direct
calculation
of
ωC/S
at
a
smooth
point
and
at
a
node
that
condition
(5)
of
the
deﬁnition
of
a
log
admissible
morphism
is
satisﬁed.
§3.17.
Before
we
can
continue,
we
need
to
make
certain
observations
concerning
the
log
structure
of
a
symmetrically
pointed
stable
log-curve
f
log
:
C
log
→
S
log
.
As
before,
we
denote
by
MC
the
étale
monoid
on
C
deﬁning
the
log
structure
of
C
log
,
and
by
NC
the
×
.
Let
ν
∈
C
sing
be
a
node.
Then
we
make
the
following
quotient
MC
/OC
Deﬁnition:
We
shall
call
an
(unordered)
pair
of
elements
(α,
β)
of
Γ(C,
NC
)
a
separating
,
β
pair
at
ν
if
α
·
β
∈
Γ(S,
NS
),
and,
moreover,
(étale
locally
at
ν),
there
exist
sections
α

projects
to
α
(respectively,
β)
in
NC
,
and
moreover,
of
MC
such
that
α

(respectively,
β)
the
images
of
α

and
β
under
the
morphism
MC
→
OC
(that
forms
the
log
structure)
map
into
and
generate
the
maximal
ideal
of
OCf
(ν)
,ν
.
Note
that
if
(α,
β)
forms
a
separating
pair,
then
it
follows
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
both
α
and
β
necessarily
belong
to
ΓC
⊆
NC
,
at
least
in
a
neighborhood
of
ν.
It
is
not
necessarily
the
case
that
a
separating
pair
at
ν
exists,
even
étale
locally
on
the
base.
However,
we
have
the
following
result:
Proposition:
Suppose
that
removing
ν
from
Cf
(ν)
breaks
Cf
(ν)
up
into
two
separate
connected
components.
Then,
étale
locally
on
S,
there
exists
a
separating
pair
α,
β
∈
Γ(C,
ΓC
)
at
ν.
Proof:
It
suﬃces
to
prove
this
in
the
universal
case.
Therefore,
we
may
assume
that
S
is
étale
over
Mg,r
.
In
fact,
by
basic
properties
of
étale
sheaves,
we
may
even
assume
that
S
is
the
completion
of
Mg,r
at
the
point
deﬁned
by
Cf
(ν)
,
and
that
the
log
structure
on
S
is
that
log
structure
pulled
back
from
the
classifying
morphism
S
→
Mg,r
.
Thus,
MC
injects
into
OC
.
In
an
étale
neighborhood
of
ν,
there
exist
elements
x,
y
of
mC,ν
(i.e.,
the
maximal
ideal
of
OC,ν
)
and
t
of
mS,f
(ν)
such
that
xy
=
t,
and
such
that
x,
y
generate
mCf
(ν),ν
.
We
then
deﬁne
α
as
follows:
In
a
neighborhood
of
ν
where
x
is
deﬁned
and
there
are
no
nodes
other
than
ν,
we
let
α
be
the
element
of
NC
deﬁned
by
x
∈
MC
⊆
OC
.
Away
from
ν,
we
deﬁne
α
as
follows:
Over
the
connected
component
where
x
is
not
identically
27
zero,
we
take
α
to
be
the
trivial
section
of
NC
.
Over
the
connected
component
where
x
is
identically
zero,
we
take
α
to
be
the
section
of
NC
deﬁned
by
t
∈
MC
⊆
OC
.
It
is
easy
to
see
that
α,
deﬁned
in
this
way
is
well-deﬁned
and
forms
a
section
of
ΓC
.
We
deﬁne
β
by
reversing
the
roles
of
x
and
y.
It
is
clear
that
(α,
β)
then
forms
a
separating
pair
at
ν.
§3.18.
We
continue
with
the
notation
of
the
preceding
§.
So
what
happens
when
the
node
ν
does
not
satisfy
the
hypotheses
of
the
preceding
Proposition?
This
happens
when
the
dual
graph
of
Cf
(ν)
has
a
loop.
In
this
case,
however,
it
is
easy
to
see
that
there
exists
f
(ν)
→
Cf
(ν)
such
that
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering

Let

Proof:
The
proof
is
completely
analogous
to
the
proof
of
the
Proposition
in
the
preceding
§.
§3.19.
Suppose
now
that
(f
:
C
→
S,
μf
⊆
C)
and
(h
:
D
→
S,
μh
⊆
D)
are
symmetrically
pointed
stable
curves,
and
that
we
are
given
an
S-morphism
π
:
C
→
D
satisfying
conditions
(2),
(3),
(4),
and
(5)
of
the
deﬁnition
of
a
log
admissible
covering.
Let
MSup
and
MSdn
be
as
in
§3.10.
Let
NSup
=
MSup
/OS×
;
and
NSdn
=
MSdn
/OS×
.
Also,
we
have
up
up
dn
dn
subsheaves
of
generators
Γup
S
⊆
NS
,
and
ΓS
⊆
NS
,
as
deﬁned
in
§3.3.
Since
ΓS
and
Γdn
S
are
constructible
sheaves
of
sets
on
S,
it
follows
that
they
can
be
represented
([28],
p.
160)
by
quasi-ﬁnite
étale
algebraic
spaces
over
S;
in
the
following
we
shall
identify
these
up
sheaves
with
the
spaces
that
represent
them.
Let
Δup
S
be
the
subsheaf
of
NS
obtained
by
up
considering
sums
of
d
sections
of
ΓS
.
Let
Z1
→
S
be
the
quasi-ﬁnite
étale
algebraic
space
over
S
parametrizing
morphisms
up
Γdn
S
→
ΔS
that
preserve
the
zero
section.
Note
that
Z1
need
not
be
a
separated
S-scheme.
Let
us
focus
attention
on
a
geometric
point
s
of
S.
Let
us
assume
that
we
are
given
a
collection
γ1
,
.
.
.
,
γN
∈
Γ(S,
Γdn
S
)
such
that
the
morphism
of
sheaves
of
sets
{1,
.
.
.
,
N
}
→
28
Γdn
S
given
by
mapping
i
to
γi
is
surjective,
and
N
is
equal
to
the
number
of
nodes
of
Ds
.
(One
can
always
ﬁnd
such
a
collection
of
γi
’s
by
étale
localization
at
s.)
Thus,
over
up
Z1
,
we
have
a
tautological
morphism
Σ
:
Γdn
S
|Z1
→
ΔS
|Z1
,
together
with
sections
γi
∈
up
dn

Γ(Z1
,
Γdn
S
)
⊆
Γ(Z1
,
NS
),
and
sections
γi
=
Σ(γi
)
∈
Γ(Z1
,
NS
).
Let
Lγi
(respectively,
×
-torsor
obtained
by
considering
Lγi
)
be
the
line
bundle
on
Z1
corresponding
to
the
OZ
1

dn
liftings
of
γ
(respectively,
γ
)
to
a
section
of
MS
(respectively,
MSup
).
Let
Z2
→
Z1
be
the
space
of
N
-tuples
of
isomorphisms
Lγi
∼
=
Lγi
over
Z1
.
Thus,
Z2
is
a
Gm
-torsor
over
Z1
.
Note
that
if
we
know
that
π
:
C
→
D
is
admissible,
then
we
obtained
a
natural
section
of
Z2
in
the
course
of
constructing
the
canonical
log
structure
on
S.
More
concretely,
in
up
the
notation
of
§3.10,
the
morphisms
Γdn
S
→
ΔS
and
Lγi
→
Lγi
are
those
induced
by
the
morphism
MSdn
→
MSup
given
by
log(b)
→
e
·
log(a),
where
the
sum
is
over
all
nodes
λ
of
Cs
that
map
to
the
node
in
question
ν
(i.e.,
the
node
for
which
b
is
a
deformation
parameter)
of
Ds
.
Let
Z3
⊆
Z2
be
the
closed
sub-algebraic
space
over
which
the
tautological
isomorphisms
Lγi
→
Lγi
are
compatible
with
the
exponential
morphisms
Lγi
→
OZ2
and
Lγi
→
OZ2
of
the
log
structures
MSdn
and
MSup
.
Let
M
ad
→
OZ3
be
the
log
structure
on
Z3
associated
to
the
largest
quotient
monoid
Q
of
(MSup
×
MSdn
)|Z3
such
that
the
following
diagram
commutes:
Lγi
|Z3
⏐
⏐

−→
MSdn
|Z3
(0,id)
−→
(MSup
×
MSdn
)|Z3

Q
⏐

id
Lγi
|Z3
−→
MSup
|Z3
(id,0)
(MSup
×
MSdn
)|Z3
−→
Q
−→
Thus,
we
obtain
a
log
algebraic
space
(Z3
,
M
ad
),
together
with
logarithmic
morphisms
log
log
(Z3
,
M
ad
)
→
(Z3
,
MSup
|Z3
)
→
MS
g,r
,
and
(Z3
,
M
ad
)
→
(Z3
,
MSdn
|Z3
)
→
MS
q,s
,
which
log
thus
determine
log-curves
CZlog
→
(Z3
,
M
ad
)
and
DZ
→
(Z3
,
M
ad
)
(whose
underlying
3
3
curves
are
C
→
S
and
D
→
S,
pulled
back
to
Z3
).
Let
us
denote
the
monoids
deﬁning
the
log
log
structures
on
CZlog
and
DZ
by
MC
and
MD
,
respectively.
Thus,
as
usual,
we
obtain
3
3
sheaves
NC
,
ΓC
,
ND
,
and
ΓD
.
§3.20.
We
maintain
the
notation
of
the
preceding
§.
Let
us
focus
attention
on
a
node
ν
of
Ds
.
Let
us
assume
that
we
have
a
separating
pair
(α,
β)
at
ν
(for
the
log-curve
def
log
DZ
→
(Z3
,
M
ad
)).
Also,
let
us
assume
that
γ
=
α
·
β
is
equal
to
the
image
of
γ1
in
M
ad
.

Let
Z4ν
→
Z3
be
the
quasi-ﬁnite
étale
algebraic
space
of
pairs
of
sections
α
,
β
of
ΓdC
|Z3
such
that
α

·
β
=
α
·
β.
(Here
we
use
the
fact
that
the
push-forward
of
a
constructible
sheaf
by
a
proper
morphism
is
again
constructible
–
see,
e.g.,
[28],
p.
223,
Theorem
2.1.)
Let
Lα
and
×
Lβ
be
the
OD
-torsors
of
liftings
to
sections
of
GD
of
α
and
β,
respectively.
Similarly,
Z3
ν
ν
we
have
Lα

and
Lβ
on
OCZ3
.
Let
Z5
→
Z4
be
the
relative
scheme
parametrizing
pairs
of
∗
∼
isomorphisms
φ
:
π
∗
Lα
∼
=
Lα

and
ψ
:
π
Lβ
=
Lβ
that
are
compatible
with
the
exponential
morphisms
of
the
log
structures
of
C
log
and
D
log
,
and
such
that
the
composite

those
induced
by
the
equalities

β

is
the
identity
morphism.
Note
that
if
we
know
that
π
:
C

D
is
admissible,
γ=α

·
β)

φ,
and
ψ
by
considering
the
morphism
of
log
then
we
automatically
obtain
canonical
α
,
β,
structures
(that
we
get
automatically
from
Proposition
11).
Of
course,
in
general,
a
separating
pair
(α,
β)
might
not
exist.
But
just
as
in
Proposition
18,
we
can
always
ﬁnd
such
a
pair
by
passing
to
an
appropriate
double
covering
of
D.
Then
it
is
easy
to
see
that
we
can
still
deﬁne
a
Z5ν
as
above
(by
working
with
the
double
coverings
of
C
and
D).
Thus,
we
obtain
Z5ν
’s
for
every
node
ν
on
Ds
.
Let
Z6
→
Z3
be
the
product
over
Z3
of
the
various
Z5ν
,
as
ν
varies
over
the
nodes
of
Ds
.
Then
we
have
the
following
Lemma:
The
morphism
π|Z6
:
C|Z6
→
D|Z6
is
an
admissible
covering.
Proof:
Indeed,
it
suﬃces
to
check
condition
(1
B)
of
the
deﬁnition
of
an
HM-admissible
covering
(§3.9).
But
this
follows
immediately
from
considering
local
generators
(near
a
node)
of
the
line
bundles
Lα
,
Lβ
,
Lα
,
and
Lβ
above,
and
writing
out
what
it
means
to
give
morphisms
φ
and
ψ
(as
in
the
deﬁnition
of
Z5ν
)
that
are
compatible
with
the
exponential
morphisms
of
the
log
structures,
and
whose
tensor
product
φ
⊗
ψ
satisﬁes
the
condition
speciﬁed
in
the
deﬁnition
of
Z5ν
.
§3.21.
We
maintain
the
notations
of
the
preceding
§.
Now
that
we
know
that
π|Z6
is
up
admissible,
we
can
consider
the
canonical
morphisms
Γdn
S
→
ΔS
;
Lγi
→
Lγi
;
Lα
→
Lα
;
Lβ
→
Lβ
arising
from
the
logarithmic
morphisms
obtained
over
the
canonical
log
structures
of
§3.10,
3.11.
Let
Z7
→
Z6
be
the
open
sub-algebraic
space
on
which
the
canonical
up
up
dn
Γdn
S
→
ΔS
agrees
with
the
tautological
ΓS
→
ΔS
given
by
the
deﬁnition
of
Z1
.
Let
Z8
⊆
Z7
be
the
closed
sub-algebraic
space
on
which
the
canonical
Lγi
→
Lγi
agrees
with
the
tautological
Lγi
→
Lγi
given
by
the
deﬁnition
of
Z2
.
Similarly,
we
let
Z9
⊆
Z8
be

Lα
→
L
;
Lβ
→
L
agree
with
the
the
sub-algebraic
space
on
which
the
canonical
α

β;


α
β
ν
ν

tautological
α
;
β;
Lα
→
Lα
;
Lβ
→
Lβ
given
by
the
deﬁnitions
of
Z4
and
Z5
.
Thus,
in
summary,
we
have
proven
the
following:
Lemma:
Let
T
→
S
be
a
morphism
of
schemes.
Then
πT
:
CT
→
DT
is
admissible
if
and
only
if
T
→
S
factors
through
Z9
.
Moreover,
this
factorization
of
T
→
S
through
Z9
is
unique.
In
particular,
the
algebraic
space
Z9
is,
in
fact,
separated
over
S.
Finally,
if
d!
is
invertible
on
S,
then
Z9
is
even
a
closed
subscheme
of
S.
Proof:
Indeed,
it
suﬃces
to
prove
the
ﬁnal
statement.
This
follows
by
noting
that
Lemma
13
implies
that
the
morphism
Z9
→
S
is
proper.
Since
it
is
also
a
monomorphism,
it
30
follows
that
it
is
quasi-ﬁnite,
hence
(by
Zariski’s
main
theorem)
ﬁnite.
Thus,
Z9
is
a
closed
subscheme
of
S.
Note
ﬁnally,
that
Z9
comes
equipped
with
a
canonical
log
structure,
i.e.,
the
log
structure
associated
to
the
admissible
covering
π|Z9
.
Remark:
In
fact,
it
is
not
diﬃcult
to
show
(although
we
will
not
use
this
fact)
that
the
morphism
Z9
→
S
is
open
(i.e.,
the
image
of
an
open
set
is
open).
However,
even
when
d!
is
invertible
on
S,
it
is
not
necessarily
the
case
either
that
Z9
and
S
coincide
as
sets,
or
that
Z9
→
S
is
an
open
immersion.
Indeed,
below
(in
§3.24),
we
shall
construct
examples
(where
d!
is
invertible
on
S)
of
points
of
S
which
are
not
in
Z9
,
as
well
as
of
cases
where
the
nilpotent
ideal
deﬁning
the
closed
subscheme
Z9
⊆
S
is
nonzero.
§3.22.
We
are
now
ready
to
state
the
main
Theorem
of
this
Section:
Theorem:
Fix
nonnegative
integers
g,
r,
q,
s,
d
such
that
2g
−
2
+
r
=
d(2q
−
2
+
s)
≥
1.
Let
A
be
the
stack
over
Z
deﬁned
as
follows:
for
a
scheme
S,
the
objects
of
A(S)
are
admissible
coverings
π
:
C
→
D
of
degree
d
from
a
symmetrically
r-pointed
stable
curve
(f
:
C
→
S;
μf
⊆
C)
of
genus
g
to
a
symmetrically
s-pointed
stable
curve
(h
:
D
→
S;
μh
⊆
D)
of
genus
q;
and
the
morphisms
of
A(S)
are
pairs
of
S-isomorphisms
α
:
C
→
C
and
β
:
D
→
D
that
stabilize
the
divisors
of
marked
points
such
that
π
◦
α
=
β
◦
π.
Then
A
is
a
separated
algebraic
stack
of
ﬁnite
type
over
Z.
Moreover,
A
is
equipped
with
a
canonical
log
log
structure
MA
→
OA
,
together
with
a
logarithmic
morphism
(A,
MA
)
→
MS
q,s
(obtained
1
].
by
mapping
(C;
D;
π)
→
D)
which
is
log
étale
(always)
and
proper
over
Z[
d!
def
log
log
Proof:
Indeed,
we
start
with
W
log
=
MS
g,r
×Z
MS
q,s
.
We
consider
the
Hilbert
stack
H
→
W
(i.e.,
H
→
W
is
a
relative
scheme)
of
morphisms
from
the
tautological
r-pointed
curve
of
genus
g
to
the
tautological
s-pointed
curve
of
genus
q.
Applying
Lemmas
15
and
16,
we
obtain
a
sub-algebraic
stack
S
⊆
H,
to
which
we
can
apply
the
constructions
of
§3.19.
Finally,
we
have
the
stack
Z9
→
S
(which
was
constructed
étale
locally
on
S,
but
which
clearly
descends
back
down
to
the
original
S
by
Lemma
21).
This
gives
us
our
log
A.
The
fact
that
the
morphism
(A,
MA
)
→
MS
q,s
is
log
étale
is
an
exercise
in
tracing
through
the
deﬁnitions
of
the
various
log
structures
involved.
The
assertion
on
properness
then
follows
from
Lemma
13.
Remark:
Applying
the
construction
of
[11],
Chapter
1,
§4.10,
to
A,
one
obtains
a
coarse
1
moduli
space
Ac
.
Moreover,
over
Z[
d!
],
Ac
is
a
projective
scheme:
Indeed,
let
Mc
be
the
coarse
moduli
space
associated
to
MS
q,s
.
It
is
well-known
(at
least
in
characteristic
zero
–
see
[23])
that
Mc
is
a
normal
projective
scheme.
Then
by
the
above
Theorem,
Ac
→
Mc
is
proper.
Also,
it
is
clear
(by
considering
the
number
of
possibilities
for
an
admissible
morphism
between
two
given
stable
curves)
that
Ac
→
Mc
is
quasi-ﬁnite.
Thus,
by
Zariski’s
main
theorem,
it
follows
that
Ac
→
Mc
is
ﬁnite.
Thus,
Ac
is
a
projective
scheme.

§3.23.
Finally,
just
as
in
[19],
p.
62,
we
can
make
explicit
the
completion
of
a
local
ring
of
A.
Let
k
be
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld.
Let
A
=
W
(k),
the
ring
of
Witt
vectors
with
coeﬃcients
in
k.
Let
π
:
C
→
D
be
an
admissible
covering
over
k.
Let
us
denote
by
[π]
∈
A(k);
[C]
∈
MS
g,r
(k);
[D]
∈
MS
q,s
(k)
the
corresponding
k-valued
points
of
the
respective
moduli
stacks.
Let
O[π]
(respectively,
O[D]
)
be
the
completion
of
the
strict
henselization
of
A
(respectively,
MS
q,s
)
at
[π]
(respectively,
[D]).
Suppose
that
D
has
exactly
N
nodes,
which
we
number
from
1
to
N
.
Thus,
we
have
a
noncanonical
isomorphism
O[D]

A[[t1

Moreover,
A

ﬂat

reduced;
and
its

Thus,
we
have
a
natural
inclusion

Finally,
the
complement
of
As
in
N
is
a
divisor
with
normal

We

refer
to

§3.24.
We
maintain
the
notations
of
the
preceding
§.
In
this
§,
we
would
like
to
construct
examples
showing
the
extent
to
which
(in
the
notation
of
Lemma
21)
Z9
=
S:
Example
1:
First,
we
show
how
to
construct
k-valued
points
of
Z9
that
are
not
in
S.
Namely,
we
consider
admissible
π
:
C
→
D
such
that
D
has
a
node
ν
over
which
two
distinct
indices
of
ramiﬁcation
e
and
e
occur
(i.e.,
e
=
e
).
Let
λ
(respectively,
λ
)
be
the
point
of
C
where
the
index
of
ramiﬁcation
e
(respectively,
e
)
occurs.
Let
us
assume
(for
simplicity)
that
ν
sits
on
two
distinct
irreducible
components
ID
and
JD
of
D.
Let
IC
(respectively,
JC
)
be
the
irreducible
component
of
C
containing
λ
that
lies
over
ID

be
the
curve
obtained
(respectively,
JD
).
Similarly,
we
deﬁne
IC
and
JC
for
λ
.
Let
C

is
exactly
the
same
as
C
except
at
λ
and
λ
;
there
we
glue
IC
(at
λ)
from
C
as
follows:
C

→
D
(induced
by
to
JC
(at
λ
)
and
IC
(at
λ
)
to
JC
(at
λ).
Then
we
have
a
map
π
:C
32
π)
which
satisﬁes
conditions
(2)
through
(5)
of
the
deﬁnition
of
a
log
admissible
covering,
but
is
obviously
not
admissible.
(In
fact,
if
e
≡
e
(mod
p)
(where
p
=
char(k)),
then
dπ

even
admits
a
log
extension
in
the
sense
of
§3.16.
Of
course,
e
≡
e
(mod
p)
is
impossible
if
d!
∈
k
×
.)
Example
2:
Let
B
=
k[]/(2
).
Let
S
=
Spec(B);
let
s
∈
S(k)
be
the
unique
point.
Let
D
=
D
×k
S;
(μh
)
=
(μh
)
×k
S
⊆
D
,
where
μh
⊆
D
is
the
divisor
of
marked
points
in
D.
We
would
like
to
consider
morphisms
π
:
C
→
D
from
a
symmetrically
pointed
stable
curve
(f
:
C
;
(μf
)
⊆
C
)
to
(D
;
(μh
)
)
such
that
π
|s
=
π;
and
π
satisﬁes
conditions
(2)
through
(5)
of
the
deﬁnition
of
a
log
admissible
morphism.
By
deformation
theory,
it
follows
that
the
isomorphism
classes
of
such
π
are
in
one-to-one
correspondence
with
the
elements
of
some
ﬁnite-dimensional
k-vector
space
V
,
which
can
be
computed
by
means
of
local
computations
at
the
nodes.
In
fact,
it
is
not
diﬃcult
to
calculate
V
explicitly.
One
thus
obtains
that
dimk
V
=

2(ei,j
−
1)
+
sgn(ei,j
−
1)
i,j
where
i,
j
run
over
all
i
and
j
as
allowed
in
§3.23,
and
sgn(0)
=
0;
sgn
of
a
positive
number
is
1.
On
the
other
hand,
the
subspace
of
V
corresponding
to
admissible
coverings
π
is
(by
what
we
did
in
§3.23)
of
dimension
i,j
sgn(ei,j
−
1),
i.e.,
in
general,
it
is
much
smaller
than
all
of
V
.
Thus,
we
see
that
even
at
a
point
of
S
contained
in
Z9
,
the
ideal
deﬁning
the
closed
subscheme
Z9
is,
in
general,
nonzero.
§3D.
Admissible
Hurwitz
Coverings
§3.25.
Let
π
:
C
→
D
be
an
admissible
covering.
Deﬁnition:
We
shall
call
π
an
admissible
Hurwitz
covering
if
the
genus
of
D
is
zero
and
π
is
simply
ramiﬁed
over
the
marked
points
of
D.
In
this
Section,
we
have
been
concerned
with
proving
the
very
general
Theorem
22
above.
In
the
rest
of
this
paper,
however,
we
will
be
concerned
only
with
Hurwitz
coverings
(i.e.,
the
sorts
of
coverings
parametrized
by
the
Hurwitz
stacks
of
§1)
and
their
degenerations,
so
we
shall
refer
to
admissible
Hurwitz
coverings
simply
as
admissible
coverings.
§3.26.
Remark:
In
this
§,
we
explain
why
the
proof
of
Theorem
4,
p.
58
of
[19]
has
a
fundamental
gap.
On
p.
60
of
[19],
it
is
claimed
that
(in
the
notation
of
[19])
H4
will
U
represent
the
functor
Hk,b
.
In
the
notation
of
our
Lemma
21,
this
essentially
amounts
to
the
assertion
that
Z9
=
S.
Indeed,
the
only
diﬀerence
between
our
S
and
[19]’s
H4
is
that
H4
includes
projective
embedding
data
for
C
(as
described
on
p.
59
of
[19]).
On
the
other
hand,
we
saw
(Examples
1
and
2
of
§3.24)
that
in
general,
Z9
=
S.
33
To
put
the
issue
another
way,
[19]
completely
neglect
the
nontrivial
issue
of
showing
that
condition
(1
B)
of
the
deﬁnition
of
an
HM-admissible
covering
is
“scheme-like,”
i.e.,
that
given
an
S-morphism
π
:
C
→
D
satisfying
all
the
conditions
for
an
admissible
covering
except
(1
B),
the
set
of
s
∈
S
over
which
πs
:
Cs
→
Ds
also
satisﬁes
(1
B)
has
the
natural
structure
of
a
subscheme
Z
of
S,
and,
moreover,
that
over
Z,
πZ
:
CZ
→
DZ
is
an
admissible
covering.
These
issues
occupy
the
bulk
of
our
proof
of
Theorem
22,
and
are
the
main
reason
for
the
introduction
of
log
structures.
Indeed,
the
condition
that
a
function
deﬁned
only
locally
in
a
neighborhood
of
a
node
on
C
have
an
eth
root
(say,
étale
locally)
is
in
general
not
a
very
“scheme-like”
condition.
For
instance,
let
S
=
Spec(k[[t]]);
X
=
Spec(k[[x,
t]]),
where
k
is
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
of
characteristic
=
2.
We
regard
X
as
an
S-scheme.
Consider
the
condition
that
the
function
x2
−
t2
have
a
square
root
étale
locally
in
a
neighborhood
of
the
point
x
=
0.
This
condition
is
satisﬁed
at
both
the
special
and
the
generic
points
of
S.
But
it
is
certainly
not
satisﬁed
over
S.
Thus,
in
order
to
obtain
a
nice
moduli
problem
it
is
necessary
to
translate
this
sort
of
local
condition
(i.e.,
condition
(1
B))
into
a
condition
which
is
global
on
the
curve
C.
This
is
precisely
what
is
achieved
by
the
introduction
of
log
structures.
§3.27.
Notation:
We
close
by
introducing
some
notation
that
will
be
of
use
in
the
rest
of
this
paper.
Let
b
≥
4
be
an
integer.
Let
R
=
Z[
b!1
].
Relative
to
the
notation
of
the
present
section,
we
are
interested
in
the
case
q
=
0,
s
=
b.
We
denote
by
ROb
(respectively,
RS
b
)
the
scheme
Mq,s
⊗Z
R
(respectively,
stack
MS
q,s
⊗Z
R),
which
thus
forms
a
compactiﬁcation
of
the
scheme
ROb
(respectively,
stack
RS
b
)
of
§1.3.
By
simple
combinatorial
analysis,
one
sees
that
in
the
genus
zero
case,
in
fact,
every
irreducible
component
of
a
stable
curve
D
of
genus
zero
over
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
is
smooth
and
rational
and
that
the
graph
obtained
by
taking
the
irreducible
components
of
D
as
vertices
and
the
singular
points
(which
necessarily
join
two
distinct
components)
as
edges
must
have
H
1
=
0
(in
the
sense
of
singular
homology).
We
shall
call
this
graph
the
“graph
associated
to
D.”
It
follows
from
[22]
that
the
complement
of
ROb
(resp.
RS
b
)
in
ROb
(resp.
RS
b
),
i.e.
“the
divisor
at
inﬁnity”
of
ROb
(resp.
RS
b
),
is
made
up
of
irreducible
components
I,
where
the
generic
point
of
I
represents
a
stable
curve
that
consists
of
two
copies
of
P1
joined
at
one
point
with
i
of
the
marking
points
on
one
component
and
b
−
i
points
on
the
other
component.
In
the
symmetrized
case,
the
divisors
at
inﬁnity
are
thus
in
one-to-one
correspondence
with
unordered
pairs
of
natural
numbers
(i,
j)
such
that
i
+
j
=
b,
i
≥
2,
j
≥
2.
Thus,
in
the
future,
we
shall
speak
of
the
“(i,j)-component”
or
“(i,j)-divisor”
(at
inﬁnity)
and
so
on.
Let
d
≥
2
be
an
integer.
Since
we
have
already
ﬁxed
q
=
0
and
s
=
b,
Theorem
22
gives
us
an
algebraic
stack
A.
Let
AR
=
A
⊗Z
R.
Note
that
by
Abhyankar’s
Lemma,
there
is
an
open
and
closed
substack
CS
b,d
of
AR
parametrizing
the
admissible
Hurwitz
coverings.
Thus,
CS
b,d
contains
HRS
b,d
as
a
dense
open
substack
(Corollary
23).
By
§2.9,
it
thus
follows
that
CS
b,d
is
geometrically
irreducible
over
R.
Let
COb,d
→
CS
b,d
be
the
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
degree
b!
obtained
by
ordering
the
marked
points
of
the
curve
of
34
genus
0
downstairs
(i.e.,
the
“D”
of
π
:
C
→
D).
Let
N
S
b,d
(respectively,
N
O
b,d
)
be
the
normalization
of
CS
b,d
(respectively,
COb,d
).
Finally,
note
that
we
have
a
commutative
diagram
N
O
b,d
⏐
⏐

−→
N
S
b,d
⏐
⏐
(∗)

−→
Mg
⏐
⏐
id
COb,d
−→

Mg
CS
b,d
where
the
horizontal
morphisms
on
the
right
assign
to
an
admissible
covering
π
:
C
→
D
the
curve
C,
and
the
square
(∗)
is
Cartesian.
§3.28.
Remark
:
The
compactiﬁcation
of
the
Hurwitz
scheme
has
many
interesting
applications
to
the
geometry
of
Mg
.
For
instance,
as
in
[27]
(the
Appendix
to
[19]),
one
sees
that
it
allows
a
direct
algebraic
proof
of
the
connectedness
of
Mg
.
One
may
also
note
that
the
proof
of
the
properness
of
the
compactiﬁcation
COb,d
never
uses
the
Semi-Stable
Reduction
Theorem.
Thus
it
follows
that
(at
least
for
high
characteristic)
we
obtain
a
new,
direct,
elementary
proof
of
this
Theorem.
§4.
Construction
of
the
Boundary
Components
§4.1.
We
shall
refer
to
the
irreducible
components
of
the
complement
of
HRS
b,d
in
CS
b,d
(respectively,
N
S
b,d
)
as
the
“divisors
at
inﬁnity”
of
CS
b,d
(respectively,
N
S
b,d
).
In
this
Section,
we
shall
give
an
explicit
construction
as
well
as
a
complete
combinatorial
description
of
the
“divisors
at
inﬁnity”
of
CS
b,d
.
(One
can
then
classify
the
divisors
at
inﬁnity
of
COb,d
according
to
which
divisor
at
inﬁnity
of
CS
b,d
they
are
mapped
to;
unfortunately,
however,
it
is
not
clear
that
the
irreducibility
results
for
divisors
at
inﬁnity
of
CS
b,d
extend
to
the
divisors
at
inﬁnity
of
COb,d
.)
§4.2.
Let
S
be
an
R-scheme.
Let
Xi
→
S,
i
=
1,
2
be
prestable
curves
in
the
sense
of
[22],
i.e.,
they
are
ﬂat
and
proper
and
have
geometric
ﬁbres
that
are
reduced,
of
dimenion
one,
and
have
at
most
ordinary
double
points
as
singularities.
Let
τi
:
S
→
Xi
be
a
section
that
lands
in
the
smooth
locus.
By
loc.
cit,
Theorem
3.4,
p.
181,
we
can
glue
together
the
Xi
’s
along
the
τi
’s
to
obtain
a
new
prestable
curve
X
→
S.
It
is
clear
that
this
construction
is
functorial,
so
if
(Yi
,
ρi
)
satisfy
the
same
hypotheses
as
the
(Xi
,
τi
),
then
we
obtain,
by
clutching,
a
new
prestable
curve
Y
→
S
as
well
as
a
morphism
X
→
Y
for
every
pair
of
morphisms
Xi
→
Yi
,
(i
=
1,
2)
that
carry
τi
to
ρi
.
It
thus
follows
that
if
we
(i)
(i)
also
give
sections
σ1
,
.
.
.
,
σbi
(i
=
1,

:

that
land
in
the
smooth

and
are
(i)
(i)
disjoint
from
each
other
and
from
ρi
,
in
such
a
way
that
(Yi
,
σ1
,
.
.
.
,
σbi
,
ρi
),
(i
=
1,
2)
is
a
(bi
+
1)-pointed
stable
curve,
and
if
the
morphisms
Xi
→
Yi
satisfy
all
the
conditions
(i)
(i)
for
an
admissible
covering
of
degree
d
over
(Yi
,
σ1

.
.

,
σbi
,
ρi
)
except
that:
35
(1)
the
ramiﬁcation
of
Xi
→
Yi
over
ρi
might
not
be
simple;
however,
it
is
(i)
(i)
tame,
and,
moreover,
we
give
sections
τ1
,
.
.
.
,
τl
,
(i
=
1,
2)
:
S
→
Xi
that
land
in
the
smooth
locus,
are
disjoint
from
each
other,
map
via
Xi
→
Yi
to
ρi
(i
=
1,
2),
and
are
such
that
over
each
geometric
point
s
(i)
(i)
of
S,
τ1,s
;
.
.
.
;
τl,s
are
exactly
the
points
of
Xi,s
which
are
in
the
inverse
image
of
ρi,s
under
Xi,s
→
Yi,s
;
moreover,
the
ramiﬁcation
index
of
(i)
Xi,s
→
Yi,s
at
τj,s
(for
all
j)
is
independent
of
i
(for
i
=
1,
2);
(2)
the
ﬁbres
of
Xi
→
S
might
not
be
geometrically
connected,
but
if
we
(1)
(2)
glue
together
X1
and
X2
along
τj
and
τj
(for
all
j),
the
resulting
X
→
S
has
geometrically
connected
ﬁbres;
then
we
may
construct
an
admissible
covering
by
taking
for
X
the
gluing
together
of
X1
(1)
(2)
and
X2
along
τj
and
τj
(for
all
j)
and
for
Y
,
the
gluing
together
of
Y1
and
Y2
along
ρ1
and
ρ2
,
and
for
the
map
X
→
Y
,
the
functorially
associated
map
for
the
pair
of
maps
X1
→
Y1
and
X2
→
Y2
.
In
particular,
note
that
Y
is
necessarily
stable.
Note
that
instead
of
gluing
together
two
“almost
admissible”
coverings
to
obtain
an
admissible
covering,
we
could
just
as
well
have
glued
together
more
than
two
“almost
admissible”
coverings
(with
the
appropriate
conditions
analogous
to
those
above
on
the
data)
to
obtain
an
admissible
covering.
However,
we
shall
have
no
need
for
this
(only
clerically)
more
diﬃcult
version
of
the
above
construction
in
this
paper.
§4.3.
Lemma
:
Let
S
be
an
excellent
Noetherian
R-scheme.
Let
V
→
S
be
smooth
of
dimension
1
with
section
ρ
:
S
→
V
.
Let
U
→
S
be
smooth
of
dimension
1
with
a
ﬁnite,
ﬂat
S-morphism
ϕ
:
U
→
V
which
is
étale
except
over
ρ
where
it
has
tame
ramiﬁcation.
Let
W
=
the
scheme
ϕ−1
S
=
U
×V
S,
where
S
is
a
V
-scheme
via
ρ.
Then
if
S
is
regular,
Wred
is
ﬁnite
étale
over
S.
Proof:
Using
the
excellence
hypothesis
(to
ensure
that
taking
“red”
commutes
with
passing
to
completion
–
see
EGA
IV
for
a
deﬁnition
and
basic
facts
about
excellent
rings),
we
reduce
immediately
to
the
case
where
S
=
Spec
A,
where
A
is
a
complete
local
ring
with
separably
closed
residue
ﬁeld.
Let
s
be
the
closed
point
of
S.
Then
let
V
∧
=
the
completion
of
V
at
the
prime
ρ(s).
Let
U
∧
=
U
×V
V
∧
.
Now
V
∧
=
Spec
A[[T
]],
where
T
is
an
indeterminate
such
that
the
image
subscheme
of
ρ
has
ideal
generated
by
T
.
By
Abhyankar’s
lemma,
U
∧
is
the
spectrum
of
a
direct
product
of
rings
of
the
form
(A[[T
]])[X]/(X
n
−
T
)
where
n
is
prime
to
char
k(s).
The
result
follows.
§4.4.
Deﬁnitions
:
set
of
data:
As
in
§1,
we
ﬁx
b,
d,
g.
We
deﬁne
a
layout
L
to
be
the
following
(1)
An
ordered
pair
of
integers
(iL
,
iR
)
with
iL
,
iR
≥
2,
iL
+
iR
=
b
(here
L
stands
for
“left”,
R
for
“right”);
(2)
Two
ordered
chains
CL

and
CR
of
iL(resp.
iR
)
transpositions
in
S
d
such
that
if
we
denote
by
CL
(resp.
CR
)
the
ordered
product
of
the
36


respective
transpositions,
then
we
have
CL
=
CR
;
and
such
that
the
subgroup
of
S
d
generated
by
all
the
transpositions
of
CL
and
CR
acts
transitively
on
{1,
.
.
.
,
d}.
L
When
we
need
to
deal
with
several
layouts
at
once,
we
shall
use
notation
like
iL
L
,
CL
,
n
1
etc.
to
denote
the
various
objects
associated
to
the
layout
L.
Let
DL
,
.
.
.
,
DLL
(resp.
nR
1
DR
,
.
.
.
,
DR
)
be
the
domains
of
transitivity
(including
those
with
only
one
element)
of
the
group
of
permutations
generated
by
the
transpositions
of
CL
(resp.
C
R
).
Werefer
to
these
as
the
left
(resp.
right)
domains
of
transitivity.
The
permutation
CL
=
CR
will
be
called
the
total
clutching
permutation
σ.
The
ordering
of
CL
gives
us
a
natural
bijection
of
{1,
.
.
.
,
iL
}
(resp.
{1,
.
.
.
,
iR
})
with
CL
(resp.
CR
).
Relative
to
this
bijection,
i
let
BLi
(resp.
BR
),
where
i
=
1,
.
.
.
,
nL
(resp.
i
=
1,
.
.
.
,
nR
)
be
the
subset
of
{1,
.
.
.
,
iL
}
i
(resp.
{1,
.
.
.
,
iR
})
corresponding
to
those
transpositions
that
act
nontrivially
on
DL
.
Let
i
i
i
i
i
i
th
bL
(resp.
bR
)
=
the
cardinality
of
BL
(resp.
BR
).
We
call
bL
(resp.
bR
)
the
i
left
(resp.
right)
partition
number
of
the
layout.
The
permutation
which
is
the
ordered
product
of
i
all
the
transpositions
of
CL
(resp.
CR
)
that
correspond
to
elements
of
BLi
(resp.
BR
)
th
i
i
left
(resp.
right)
clutching
permutation
σ
(resp.
σ
)
and
will
also
will
be
called
the
i
L
R


be
written
Di
CL
(resp.
Di
CR
).
Note
that
the
total
clutching
permutation
σ
is
the
L
R
i
i
product
of
the
σL
(resp.
σR
)
over
i
=
1,
.
.
.
,
nL
(resp.
i
=
1,
.
.
.
nR
).
Two
layouts
will
be
said
to
be
isomorphic
if
one
can
be
obtained
from
the
other
by
switching
left
and
right
and/
or
by
conjugating
all
the
data
by
a
some
element
of
S
d
.
It
is
clear
that
isomorphism
is
an
equivalence
relation.
We
denote
the
(ﬁnite)
set
of
layouts
by
Lb,d
(or
simply
L
when
b,
d
are
ﬁxed
and
clear)
and
the
set
of
isomorphism
classes
of
layouts
by
CLb,d
(or
simply
CL).
Given
a
layout
L,
we
deﬁne
its
template
T
to
be
the
following
set
of
data:
(1)
The
ordered
pair
(iL
,
iR
);
(2)
The
(unordered)
set
of
“left”
(resp.
“right”)
triples
of
the
following
sort:
Each
“left”
(resp.
“right”)
triple
consists
of
a
left
(resp.
right)
domain
of
transitivity,
its
associated
clutching
permutation,
and
its
associated
partition
number.
Let
Tb,d
(or
simply
T)
be
the
set
of
templates
T
corresponding
to
all
possible
layouts
L.
Note
that
we
have
an
analogous
notion
of
isomorphism
of
templates,
corresponding
to
switching
left
and
right
and/
or
conjugating
by
a
permutation.
Let
CTb,d
(or
simply
CT)
be
the
set
of
isomorphism
classes
of
templates.
Then
we
have
the
following
natural
surjections:
Φ:L
−→
T
Ψ
:
CL
−→
CT
§4.5.
Theorem
:
The
divisors
at
inﬁnity
of
CS
b,d
are
in
natural
one-to-one
correspondence
with
the
elements
of
CT.
37
Proof:
The
proof
will
consist
of
several
steps:
Step
A:
Construction
of
divisors
at
inﬁnity:
Let
T
∈
Tb,d
be
a
template.
We
start
by
constructing
the
“left
iL
-point
stack”.
(Of
course,
the
construction
of
the
right
iR
-point
stack
is
entirely
analogous.)
Let
LROT
=
RO(iL
+1)
,
where
L
stands
for
“left”,
RO
for
“rigidiﬁed,
ordered”
(as
usual),
and
T
denotes
the
dependence
on
the
template.
Let
b1
,
.
.
.
,
bnL
be
the
left
partition
numbers
(in
any
order!)
of
the
template
T
.
Let
us
partition
the
set
{1,
.
.
.
,
iL
}
into
disjoint
subsets
Ai
(where
i
=
1,
.
.
.
,
nL
)
of
bi
elements.
The
sections
of
P1
×
LROT
corresponding
to
the
set
Ai
will
be
called
sections
of
the
ith
partition.
The
last
section
will
be
called
the
clutching
section.
Let
πi
:
LROT
→
DRObi
+1
denote
the
map
corresponding
to
sending
the
sections
of
the
ith
left
partition
(in
some
order)
to
the
marking
sections
of
DRObi
+1
and
the
clutching
section
to
the
clutching
section
(recall
the
terminology
from
§1).
Now
G
=
S
b1
×
S
b2
×
.
.
.
×
S
bnL
generically
acts
freely
on
LROT
by
allowing
the
ith
factor
to
act
naturally
on
the
sections
of
the
ith
partition.
We
deﬁne
the
left
iL
-point
stack,
LRS
T
,
to
be
the
quotient
(in
the
sense
of
stacks)
of
LROT
by
G,
which
is
generically
a
scheme
(by
the
generic
freeness
of
the
section
of
G).
Note
that
the
πi
’s
induce
natural
projections
ϕi
:
LRS
T
→
DRS
bi
+1
.
Now
let
σi
∈
S
d
be
the
ith
left
clutching
permutation.
Let
Di
be
the
ith
left
domain
of
transitivity,
and
let
di
=
the
cardinality
of
Di
.
Then
we
constructed
(§1.4,
1.5)
DHRS
σbii+1,di
and
a
“pseudo-universal”
covering:
βi
Ci
−→
αi

P1Di
⏐
⏐

⊇
D
Di
⊇
MDi
,
CDi
Di
where
CDi
∼
=
Di
,
and
we
write
Di
for
DHRS
σbii+1,di
.
Recall
that
CDi
is
the
clutching
section,
while
MDi
(which
is
ﬁnite
étale
of
rank
bi
over
Di
)
is
the
marking
divisor.
Since
Di
is
regular,
it
follows
by
Lemma
3
that
the
reduced
inverse
image
via
βi
of
CDi
is
étale
∼
over
CDi
∼
.
Now
the
question
arises:
=
Di
;
let
us
denote
this
reduced
inverse
image
by
CD
i
∼
∼
is
CDi
“geometric”
over
R
in
the
sense
that
the
étale
covering
CD
→
CDi
does
not
factor
i
∼
through
a
covering
obtained
by
tensoring
up
by
an
étale
cover
R
of
R?
I
claim
that
the
answer
is
“yes”.
Indeed,
recall
from
Proposition
10
of
§2
that
the
connected
components
over
R
correspond
naturally
to
the
various
ramiﬁcation
indices,
and
these
components
are,
in
fact,
geometric
over
R.
We
are
now
in
a
position
to
construct
the
left
degenerate
Hurwitz
stack
associated
to
the
template
T
,
which
we
we
shall
call
LDHT
.
We
deﬁne
LDHT
to
be
the
ﬁbred
product
over
LRS
T
of
the
pull-backs
via
the
ϕi
of
the
arrow
Di
→
DRS
bi
+1
.
It
is
clear
by
the
results
of
§2
that
LDHT
is
smooth
and
geometrically
irreducible
over
R.
We
can
∼
∧
also
pull-back
the
coverings
CD
→
Di
to
coverings
CD
→
LDHT
.
These
coverings
are
i
i
étale
and
“geometric”
in
the
sense
used
above.
Therefore,
by
basic
facts
of
Galois
theory,
there
exists
a
(noncanonical)
ﬁnite
étale
Galois
covering
Λ
→
LDHT
that
dominates
38
∼
all
the
connected
components
of
all
the
CD
(for
all
i)
and
which
is
geometrically
irrei
∼
,
DDi
by
ducible
over
R.
We
denote
the
pull-backs
of
the
objects
Ci
,
αi
,
βi
,
MDi
,
CDi

CD
i
∼,Λ
Λ
Λ
Λ
Λ
Ci
,
γi
,

Mi

.
We
thus
obtain
a
commutative
diagram:
Ci∼,Λ
⊆
δ
CiΛ
i
−→
γi

P1Λ
⏐
⏐

⊇
DiΛ

MiΛ
,
CiΛ
∼
=Λ
(Diagram
4.1)
Λ
where
the
relative
dimension
of
Λ
is
iL
−
2.
Note
that
Ci∼,Λ
→
Λ
is
split
(i.e.,
every
connected
component
of
Ci∼,Λ
maps
isomorphically
to
Λ).
Analogously,
we
construct
the
right
degenerate
Hurwitz
stack
RDHT
and,
in
place
of
Λ,
we
have
P
(the
capital
Greek
letter
“rho”).
We
thus
obtain
a
diagram:
Ci∼,P
⊆
CiP
ζi


P1P
⏐
⏐


⊇
DiP
⊇
MiP
,
CiP
∼
=P
(Diagram
4.2)
P
def
where
(again)
the
relative
dimension
of
P
over
R
is
iR
−
2.
Thus
K
=
Λ
×R
P
has
relative
dimension
over
R
equal
to
b
−
4.
This
is
just
the
right
dimension
for
a
divisor
of
CS
b,d
.
Let
us
pull
the
Diagrams
4.1
and
4.2
back
to
K
via
the
projections
to
Λ
and
P
,
and
∼,Λ
Λ
denote
the
objects
so
obtained
by
Ci,K
;
Ci,K
;
etc.
Now
we
ﬁrst
glue
the
left
and
right
1
Λ
P
copies
of
P
together
along
Ci
and
Ci
;
using
the
marking
divisors
MiΛ
and
MiP
we
thus
obtain
a
b-pointed
stable
curve
B
→
K.
Let
us
next
note
that
(referring
to
§4.4)
the
irreducible
components
of
CiΛ
(resp.
CiP
)
correspond
naturally
to
the
left
(respectively,
right)
domains
of
transitivity,
which
is
part
of
the
information
of
the
layout
that
is
preserved
inthe
template.
Thus,
there
is
a
natural
isomorphism
CiΛ
∼
=
CiP
.
Let
us
glue

Λ
P
together
i=1,...,nL
Ci,K
and
i=1,...,nR
Ci,K
(both
prestable
curves)
along
CiΛ
and
CiP
via
this
isomorphism
and
call
the
resulting
curve
X
→
K.
It
follows
from
the
conditions
in
the
deﬁnition
of
a
layout
and
by
what
we
did
in
§4.2,
that
we
then
obtain
an
admissible
covering
f
:
X
→
B
over
K.
By
the
modular
deﬁnition
of
CS
b,d
,
we
then
obtain
a
morphism
K
→
CS
b,d
which
we
call
M
T
.
It
is
clear
by
composition
with
the
morphism
CS
b,d
→
RS
b
that
M
T
is
quasi-ﬁnite.
Thus,
for
dimensional
reasons,
the
closure
of
its
image
must
be
an
irreducible
divisor
of
CS
b,d
,
which
is
ﬂat
over
R.
We
shall
refer
to
this
divisor
as
the
divisor
D
T
associated
to
T
.
We
shall
also
refer
to
any
divisor
of
N
S
b,d
that
lies
above
D
T
as
a
“divisor
associated
to
T
”.
Finally,
it
is
clear
that
isomorphic
templates
deﬁne
the
same
divisor.
Thus
we
obtain
a
map:
Ω
:
CT
−→
{divisors
at
inf
inity
of
CS
b,d
}
39
Step
B:
Surjectivity
of
Ω:
Since
CS
b,d
→
RS
b
is
ﬂat
(Corollary
23
of
§3),
every
divisor
at
inﬁnity
of
CS
b,d
lies
above
a
divisor
at
inﬁnity
of
RS
b,d
,
whose
generic
element
is
necessarily
of
the
form
given
in
Diagram
3.1.
Thus
it
suﬃces
to
see
that
every
geometric
point
of
CS
b,d
such
that
the
stable
curve
downstairs
is
of
the
form
given
in
Diagram
3.1
(in
the
future,
we
shall
call
such
a
covering
a
basic
admissible
covering
of
type
(i,
j),
where
(i,
j)
is
as
in
loc.
cit.)
is
in
the
image
of
a
geometric
point
of
one
the
M
T
’s.
But
this
is
obvious
from
the
construction.
Step
C:
Injectivity
of
Ω:
It
suﬃces
to
see
that
given
any
basic
admissible
covering,
we
can
recover
the
information
contained
in
a
template
from
the
purely
geometric
data
of
the
covering.
But
this
is
clear,
for
left
(resp.
right)
domains
of
transitivity
correspond
to
the
irreducible
components
on
the
left
(resp.
right)
hand
side
of
the
curve
upstairs,
associated
clutching
permutation
correspond
to
the
ramiﬁcation
data
at
clutching
points,
and
partition
numbers
correspond
to
the
number
simple
ramiﬁcation
points
of
each
irreducible
component
upstairs.
§4.6.
Any
particular
divisor
at
inﬁnity
of
CS
b,d
will
be
called
a
Species.
If
(iL
,
iR
)
is
the
ﬁrst
piece
of
data
of
a
template
T
(see
§4.4),
then
we
call
T
a
“template
of
type

We
also
say
that
the
corresponding
Species
is
of
type

iR
).
Before
going
on,
it
is
worthwhile
to
enumerate
the
various

By
the

Theorem,
this
amounts
to
classifying
explicitly
the
various
templates
that

for
basic
admissible
coverings
of

Let
C
be
a
component
on
the
right
hand
side
of
the
curve
upstairs
for
such
a
covering.
Then
either:
I.
C
has
no
“x”’s
(i.e.,
simple
ramiﬁcation
points);
then
C
maps
isomorphically
to
the
copy
of
P1
downstairs;
II.
C
has
exactly
one
“x”;
then
it
is
clear
that
C
∼
=
P1
and
the
map
downstairs
must
be
the
“squaring
map”;
there
is
one
clutching
point
on
C,
where
the
ramiﬁcation
index
is
two;
or
III.
C
has
exactly
two
“x”’s;
then
each
of
those
corresponds
to
a
transposition;
up
to
renaming
elements,
these
two
transpositions
are
either:
(A)
(12),
(23):
then
C
∼
=
P1
;
there
is
one
clutching
point
on
C
with
ramiﬁcation
index
three;
the
map
downstairs
is
some
uniquely
determined
map;
40
(B)
(12),
(12):
then
C
∼
=
P1
;
there
is
no
ramiﬁcation
at
the
clutching
points,
of
which
there
are
two
on
C;
the
map
downstairs
is
the
“squaring
map”;
(C)
(12),
(34):
the
degree
of
the
map
from
C
to
the
copy
of
P1
downstairs
would
have
to
be
four,
and
the
degree
of
the
total
ramiﬁcation
divisor
on
C
would
also
have
to
be
four;
thus
this
case
is
impossible
by
the
Riemann-Hurwitz
formula.
Let
us
now
consider
the
totality
of
components
on
the
right.
Exactly
one
of
the
following
two
possibilities
must
hold:
(1)
There
are
two
components
on
the
right
with
one
“x”
each
and
all
the
other
components
have
no
“x”’s.
In
this
case,
let
us
consider
the
associated
graph
of
the
curve
upstairs.
On
the
right,
we
have
d
−
2
vertices,
each
with
exactly
one
edge
protruding
from
it.
It
follows
that
if
the
graph
is
to
be
connected
(which
it
must
be),
then
there
can
only
be
one
irreducible
component
on
the
left.
This
component
is
a
smooth
component
of
genus
g
(the
original
genus)
and
has
d
−
2
clutching
points,
one
going
to
each
irreducible
component
on
the
right.
Of
these,
there
is
ramiﬁcation
of
degree
2
at
two
clutching
points
(which
we
shall
call
points
of
degenerate
ramiﬁcation),
and
no
ramiﬁcation
at
any
of
the
d
−
4
others.
It
is
thus
clear
that
in
this
case,
the
template
is
uniquely
determined.
We
call
the
corresponding
divisor
at
inﬁnity
the
divisor
of
Species
2.
A
typical
basic
admissible
covering
of
this
Species
is
shown
in
the
Pictorial
Appendix.
(2)
There
is
exactly
one
component
on
the
right
with
two
“x”’s,
and
all
the
other
components
have
no
“x”’s.
Then
the
component
with
two
“x”’s
is
as
in
exactly
one
of
the
following,
corresponding,
respectively,
to
the
Cases
(A)
and
(B)
of
the
preceding
III:
(A)
It
is
clear
that
the
graph
of
the
curve
upstairs
is
the
same
in
in
(1)
above.
Thus
there
is
only
one
irreducible
component
on
the
left;
it
is
smooth
of
genus
g
and
has
d
−
2
clutching
points,
one
going
to
each
irreducible
component
on
the
right.
Of
these,
there
is
ramiﬁcation
of
degree
3
at
one
clutching
point
(which
we
shall
call
the
point
of
degenerate
ramiﬁcation)
and
no
ramiﬁcation
at
any
of
the
d−3
others.
It
is
thus
clear
that
in
this
case,
the
template
is
uniquely
determined.
We
call
the
corresponding
divisor
at
inﬁnity
the
divisor
of
Species
1.
A
typical
basic
admissible
covering
of
this
Species
is
shown
in
the
Pictorial
Appendix.
(B)
Let
us
consider
the
graph
associated
the
curve
upstairs.
On
the
right,
we
have
d
−
1
vertices;
from
d
−
2
of
them,
there
protrudes
exactly
one
edge;
from
the
other
one
of
them
there
protrude
exactly
two
edges.
Now
either
those
two
edges
end
up
at
the
same
vertex
on
the
left,
or
they
end
up
at
diﬀerent
vertices.
We
thus
examine
each
of
these
two
cases:
41
α
)
The
Same
Vertex:
Then
there
is
only
one
vertex
on
the
left.
This
corresponds
to
a
smooth,
irreducible
component
of
genus
g
−
1,
since
the
loop
on
the
graph
contributes
“one”
to
the
arithmetic
genus
of
the
curve
upstairs.
There
are
exactly
d
clutching
points
on
this
component
on
the
left,
all
of
which
are
unramiﬁed.
Of
these
d
−
2
connect
to
components
on
the
right
of
type
(I)
in
our
classiﬁcation
above
of
components
of
the
curve
upstairs,
and
the
other
2
(which
we
shall
points
of
degenerate
ramiﬁcation)
connect
to
the
component
of
type
(III)
(B)
in
that
classiﬁcation.
Clearly
the
template
is
thus
uniquely
determined.
We
call
the
corresponding
divisor
at
inﬁnity
the
divisor
of
Species
3A.
A
typical
basic
admissible
covering
of
this
Species
is
shown
in
the
Pictorial
Appendix.
β
)
Diﬀerent
Vertices:
Then
it
is
clear
that
these
are
the
only
two
vertices
on
the
left.
They
correspond
to
two
smooth,
irreducible
components
C1
and
C2
.
Let
gi
be
the
genus
of
Ci
(where
i
=
1,
2).
If
bi
=
the
number
of
“x”’s
on
Ci
,
and
di
is
the
degree
of
Ci
over
the
left
hand
copy
of
P1
,
then
we
have,
by
the
Hurwitz
formula,
2
(gi
−
1)
+
2di
=
bi
,
g1
+
g2
=
g,
b1
+
b2
=
b
−
2,
d1
+
d2
=
d.
The
map
downstairs
Ci
→
P1
thus
has
only
simple
ramiﬁcation.
The
clutching
points
are
all
unramiﬁed
with
one
clutching
point
on
each
Ci
(which
we
shall
refer
to
as
a
point
of
degenerate
ramiﬁcation)going
to
the
component
of
type
(III)
(B);
the
other
di
−1
clutching
points
on
each
Ci
go
to
components
of
type
(I).
Given
pairs
of
integers
(b1
,
b2
),
(d1
,
d2
)
such
that
b1
+
b2
=
b
−
2,
d1
+
d2
=
d,
with
bi
≥
0,
di
≥
1
and
such
that
the
gi
’s
computed
via
the
Hurwitz
formula
are
nonnegative
integers
(for
i
=
1,
2)
will
always
appear,
and
once
the
bi
’s
and
di
’s
are
given,
the
template
is
clearly
uniquely
determined.
The
corresponding
divisor
at
inﬁnity
will
be
call
the
divisor
of
Species
3B
(b1
,
b2
);
(d1
,
d2
).
It
will
turn
out
that
the
case
when
b1
=
b
−
2,
b2
=
0,
d1
=
d
−
1,
d2
=
1
(⇒
g1
=
g,
g2
=
0)
will
be
especially
important;
we
shall
call
this
case
the
divisor
of
Species
3B
∗
.
As
usual,
illustrations
are
shown
in
the
Pictorial
Appendix.
§4.7.
Let
us
note
that
among
the
templates
of
type
(b
−
2,
2),
the
Species
that
do
not
42
map
via
the
map
CS
b,d
→
Mg
of
§3.27,
into
the
boundary
at
inﬁnity
of
Mg
are
exactly
Species
1,
2,
and
3B
(b1
,
b2
);
(d1
,
d2
)
when
g1
=
g,
g2
=
0.
Among
these,
it
turns
out
that
the
divisors
of
Species
1,
2,
and
3B
∗
(which
constitutes
a
set
of
precisely
three
divisors)
will
play
an
important
role
in
the
future.
We
shall
refer
to
these
three
divisors
as
the
excess
divisors.
§4.8.
If
F
is
a
ring
and
E
is
a
set,
we
shall
denote
by
F
[E]
the
free
F
-module
generated
by
elements
of
E.
By
Theorem
5,
to
every
element
of
the
set
CT,
one
can
naturally
associate
a
divisor,
hence
a
divisor
class
of
CS
b,d
,
i.e.,
an
element
of
Cl(CS
b,d
).
We
thus
obtain
a
map:
Σ
:
Z[CT]
−→
Cl(CS
b,d
)
Later
we
shall
show
the
following
Theorem:
If
d
>
2g
+
4,
g
≥
5,
then
the
group
Cl(CS
b,d
)
is
of
ﬁnite
type
over
Z,
and
Σ
is
a
surjection
when
tensored
with
Q.
Clearly
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
P
ic(HRS
b,d
)
is
ﬁnite.
We
shall
complete
the
proof
in
§6.7.
Appendix
to
§4
§4.9.
In
SGA
7,
one
ﬁnds
an
exposition
of
the
theory
of
vanishing
cycles
for
ordinary
(i.e.,
0-pointed)
stable
curves.
Although
the
theory
of
vanishing
cycles
for
arbitrary
bpointed
stable
curves
is
also
implicit
in
SGA,
we
review
it
here
explicitly
for
the
sake
of
clarity.
In
the
case
of
b-pointed
stable
curves
of
genus
zero,
which
is
the
principal
case
of
interest
here,
one
can
often
describe
the
monodromy
action
much
more
explicitly
than
in
the
0-pointed
higher
genus
case
since
the
fundamental
group
involved
is
a
free
group.
§4.10.
Let
(A,
m)
be
a
strictly
henselian
discrete
valuation
ring,
S
=
Spec
A.
Let
f
b
i=1
σi
(S).
{C
−→S;
σ1
,
.
.
.
,
σb
:
S
→
C}
be
a
b-pointed
stable
curve
over
S.
Let
U
=
C
−
We
use
the
notation
Uη
,
Uη
,
Us
,
as
usual.
Then
we
have
the
following
Proposition
:
There
is
a
natural,
surjective
morphism
of
specialization:
π1t
(Uη
,
ρη
)
−→
π1t
(Us
,
ρs
)
where
ρ
:
S
→
U
is
a
section
of
f
,
and
“t”
means
the
tame
fundamental
group,
and
the
“prime”
next
to
the
fundamental
group
indicates
that
we
are
only
concerned
with
the
part
of
the
fundamental
dealing
with
coverings
of
degree
prime
to
the
residue
characteristic
of
A.
43
Remark:
It
has
been
pointed
out
by
the
referee
that
this
result
has
already
been
proven
by
Grothendieck
in
[5].
Proof:
Write
j
:
U
→
C
for
the
natural
inclusion.
Let
G
=
a
ﬁnite
group
of
order
prime
to
the
residue
characteristic
of
A.
By
[29],
Exposé
XIII,
Theorem
2.4,
p.
380,
we
have
R1ét
js
∗
GUs
∼
=
(R1ét
j∗
GU
)|Cs
.
By
the
Leray
spectral
sequence
and
the
proper
base
change
theorem,
we
thus
see
that
π1t
(Us
,
ρs
)
∼
=
π1t
(U,
ρs
)
∼
=
π1t
(U,
ρη
).
The
rest
of
the
Proposition
then
follows
trivially.
§4.11.
Let
us
now
assume
that
C
is
obtained
in
the
following
fashion.
We
are
given
a
collection
of
generically
distinct
sections
σ1
,
.
.
.
σb
:
S
→
P1S
such
that
σ1
(S)
intersects
σ2
(S),
but
all
the
other
intersections
among
pairs
of
σi
are
empty.
Then
C
is
obtained
by
blowing
up
P1S
at
the
schematic
intersection
of
σ1
(S)
and
σ2
(S);
we
thus
obtain
a
stable
f
curve
{C
−→S;
σ1
,
.
.
.
,
σb
}
where
the
σi
are
induced
by
the
σi
.
Now
if
we
ﬁx
a
base
section
ρ
(that
doesn’t
intersect
any
of
the
σi
),
and
assume
(for
simplicity)
that
we
are
working
over
C,
then
π1an
(Uη
,
ρη
)
may
be
described
as
being
generated
by
paths
γ1
,
.
.
.
γb
around
the
various
σi,η
with
the
sole
relation
that
γ1
γ2
.
.
.
γb
=
1,
i.e.,
a
free
group
on
b
−
1
generators.
On
the
other
hand,
π1an
(Us
)
may
be
described
as
being
generated
by
paths
δ1
,
.
.
.
,
δb
around
the
various
σi,s
with
the
sole
relations
δ1
δ2
=
1,
δ3
δ4
.
.
.
δb
=
1.
An
illustration
of
this
degeneration
situation
is
given
in
the
Pictorial
Appendix.
The
morphism
of
specialization
is
given
by
γi
→
δi
,
so
the
“vanishing
cycle”
is
clearly
γ1
γ2
=
(γ3

γb
)−1
.

Cohomology
Calculations
§5.1.
In
this
Section,
we
compute
the
various
cohomology
groups
of
a
number
of
universal
objects,
in
preparation
for
the
construction
of
the
“main
ﬁbration”
in
the
next
Section.
At
ﬁrst,
we
shall
work
over
C,
so
that
we
can
use
a
number
of
analytic
results;
at
the
end
of
the
Section,
we
shall
extend
the
results
to
the
arithmetic
situation
over
Z.
Thus,
unless
we
specify
otherwise,
all
objects
are
taken
to
be
over
the
complex
numbers
C.
Often
in
this
Section,
we
shall
use
the
language
of
torsors
over
a
group;
for
the
reader
unfamiliar
with
this
language,
we
suggest
[15]
as
a
place
to
start.
§5.2.
Let
Mg
=
the
moduli
stack
of
smooth
curves
of
genus
g
with
g
≥
5.
Let
f
:
C
→
Mg
be
the
universal
curve
of
genus
g.
Let
P
=
P
ic
(C/Mg
)
be
the
Picard
stack,
a
smooth
algebraic
group
stack
over
Mg
,
which
doesn’t
necessarily
represent
the
Picard
functor
Pic
(since
f
doesn’t
admit
a
section),
but
is,
instead,
its
étale
sheaﬁﬁcation
(see,
e.g.,
[12]
for
a
detailed
discussion
of
the
Picard
functor);
thus
we
have
a
morphism
ϕ
Pic
→
P.
Let
J
=
P
icτ
(C/Mg
)−→Mg
be
the
open
subgroup
which
is
the
universal
47
Jacobian.
Let
E
=
P/J
be
the
quotient
étale
group
stack,
with
geometric
ﬁbres
over
Mg
isomorphic
Z.
Thus
we
have
the
following
situation:

J

Now
from
the
existence
of
the
global
bundle
ω
=
Ω1C/Mg
on
C,
or
by
the
existence
of
the
degree
map,
one
sees
that
E
∼
=
Mg
×
Z.
Thus
P
splits
into
connected
components
J
d
,
with
d
∈
Z,
according
to
the
degree.
Each
J
d
is
thus
J
-torsor
in
the
étale
topology
over
1
Mg
,
i.e.,
an
element
ηd
∈
Hét
(Mg
,
J
).
From
the
fact
that
P
is
a
group
stack,
we
see
that
ηd
=
d
η1
.
From
the
existence
of
ω,
we
see
that
2(g
−
1)
η1
=
0.
Let
χ
=
2(g
−
1).
Then
if
we
“change
groups”
for
the
torsor
J
d
via
the
homomorphism
[χ]
:
J
→
J
multiplication
by
χ,
we
obtain
a
new
J
-torsor
J

,
which
is
clearly
trivial.
Moreover,

for

(In
fact,
in
(C)
Let
F

Then
Han
[16],
Harer
makes
the
stronger
assertion
than
in
fact
the
ﬁrst

group
of
F
vanishes;
later
in
a
correction
(whose
existence
is
mentioned
in
[17],
Chapter
7)
he
retracts
this
and
asserts
only
that
the
ﬁrst
homology
group
of
F
is
torsion;
but
this
implies
that
the
ﬁrst
cohomology
group
must
vanish.)

(In

the
result
in
[1]
is
stated
only
for
the
moduli
stack
of
b-pointed
stable
curves
of
genus

but
one
deduces
(D)
easily
from
this
fact
using
elementary
properties
of
the
Picard
group.)
48
Recall
that
F
is
a
locally
constant
sheaf
of
free
Z-modules
of
rank
2g
on
Mg
.
Moreover,
F
is
endowed
with
a
natural
symplectic
form
E
(“the

Lemma
:

by
the
element

2

under
the
isomorphism
Ran
ϕ∗

F.
Proof:
Since
E
is
not
a
multiple
of
any
other
form,
it
suﬃces
to
prove
the
result
after
tensoring
with
Q.
If
M
is
the
Γ-module
(where
Γ
=

corresponding
to
F

then
since
∧2Q

M

(M,

(where
the
last
isomorphism
of
Γ-modules
follows
from
the
fact
that
via
E,
M
is
a
self-dual
Γ-module),
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
M
is
an
irreducible
Γ-module.
But
this
action
factors
through
the
surjection
[8],
p.
107,
Γ

Sp(2g,

and
one
sees
from
looking
at
well-known
sets
of
generators
that
Sp(2g,
Z)
is
Zariski
dense
in
Sp(2g,
Q).
Moreover,
it
is
obvious
that
M
is
irreducible
under
the
action
of
Sp(2g,
Q).
The
Lemma
follows.

§5.4.
Proposition
:
There
exists
an
isomorphism
A
:
J
→J
∧
(i.e.,
the
dual
abelian
stack
to
J
)
whose
corresponding
alternating
form
is
E.
Proof:
This,
in
fact,
holds
over
Z,
so
for
the
remainder
of
§5.4,
we
work
over
Z,
not
C.
The
Proposition
is
well-known
when
there
exists
a
section
of
C.
Thus,
let
K
=
the
quotient
ﬁeld
of
Mg
;
let
L
be
a
ﬁnite
Galois
extension
of
K
such
that
CL
admits
a
section.
We
∼
thus
obtain
an
isomorphism
JL
→JL∧
with
the
desired
property.
Since
E
is
deﬁned
over
∼
K,
this
isomorphism
descends
to
JK
→JK∧
.
By
[11],
Remark

p.7,
the
isomorphism
extends
over
Mg
.
Corollary
:
There
exists
a
line

on

whose

Chern
class
(with

to

is
2E.
Proof:

§5.5.
Proposition
:
The
ﬁrst
Chern
class
induces
a
surjection
c1
:
P

and
we
have
an

Q

c1
(P
ic(J

Q

where
the
injection
is
the
pull-back
via
J
d
→
Mg
and
the
surjection
is
the
relative
ﬁrst
Chern
class
with
respect
ϕ.
Proof:
Clear
from
the
preceding
paragraphs.
At
ﬁrst
it
may
appear
that
c1
is
only
surjective
up
to
torsion,
but
it
follows
from
the
Kummer
and
exponential
exact
sequences
that
the
cokernel
of
c1
is
always
torsion-free.

Let
C

Write

Denote

the

to
the

of
a
universal

of
degree
d
on
C
.
Write
id
:
J
d
→
P
for
the
natural
inclusion.
From
the
Leray
spectral
sequence
of
ψd
for
the
étale
sheaf
Gm

we
get
an
exact
sequence:

By
general
nonsense,
κd
=
γ(id).
From
the
existence
of
ω
on
C,
one
sees
that
under
the
identiﬁcation
C
∼,d
∼
=
C
∼,d+χ
(via
ω),
we
have
κd
=
κd+χ
.
On
the
other
hand,
if
d
>
χ,
then
the
functor
Div
d
of
eﬀective
divisors
of
degree
d
is
a
Brauer-Severi
stack
over
J
d
(by
which
we
mean
that
it
is
a
projective
bundle
in
the
étale
topology),
whose
associated
class
2
in
Hét
(J
d

Gm
)
is
clearly
κd
.
Thus
we
see
that
for
all
d,
κd
is
a
torsion
element.

Proposition

c1
:
P
ic

Han
Proof:
If
suﬃces
to
prove
that
for
d
large,
P
ic
(J
d
)
is
ﬁnitely
generated
(since
the
kernel
of
c1
must
be
inﬁnitely
divisible).
Now
if
X
=
C
×Mg

.
.
×Mg
C
(the
d-fold
product),
then
we
know
that
P
ic
(X
)
is
ﬁnitely
generated.
Now
we
have
a
natural
ﬁnite
ﬂat
map
X
→
Div
d
;
hence,
via
the
associated
norm
map
P
ic
(X
)
→
P
ic
(Div
d
),
we
see
that
P
ic
(Div
d
)
is
ﬁnitely
generated.
We
also
have
a
natural
map
π
:
Div
d
→
J
d
(which
is
a
Brauer-Severi
morphism),
so
if
L
is
a
line
bundle
on
J
d
,
then
L
∼
=
π∗
π
∗
L.
Thus
π
∗
:
P
ic
(J

)
→
P
ic
(Div

is
an
injection,
and
we
are
done.
§5.8.
We
now
go
back
to
working
over
an
arbitrary
base,
which
we
denote
by
a
subscript.
Let
X
=
C
or
J
d
.
Then
we
have
the
following
Proposition
:
The
natural
map
P
ic
(XZ
)
→
P
ic
(XC
)
is
injective
with
ﬁnite
cokernel.
Proof:
Injectivity
follows
from
the
fact
that
H
0
(XR
,
OXR
)
=
R
for
any
ring
R.
The
rest
follows
from
the
preceding
paragraph.
§5.9.
Given
any
relative
Brauer-Severi
stack
f
:
X

S,
we
obtain
a
bundle
of
Grassmannians
f

X

→
S
(in
the
étale
topology)
by
considering
the
lines
in
the
projective
spaces
of
the
ﬁbres
of
f
.
Applying
this
construction
to
Div
d
→
J
d
(for
d
>
χ),
we
obtain
a
map
ψ
:
G
d
→
J
d
.
Denote
by
ζ
the
canonical
bundle
on
G
d
for
ψ.
Write
P
icQ
(
?
)
for
P
ic(

)
⊗Z
Q.
We
call
elements
of
P
icQ
(

)
“virtual
line
bundles”.
Denote
by
γ
∈
P
icQ
(G
d
)
the
Q-multiple
ζ
such
that
restricted
to
the
ﬁbres
of
ψ,
it
is
the
line
bundle
that
deﬁnes
the
Plücker
embedding.
Deﬁnition
:
We
shall
refer
to
the
following
diagram
as
the
main
ﬁbration
:

We
now
wish
to
deﬁne
a
canonical
element
Θd
∈
P
icQ
(J
d
)
which
has
relative
ﬁrst
Chern
class
with
respect
to
ϕ
equal
to
E.
We
do
this
as
follows.
Since
J
0
→
Mg
has
the
canonical
identity
section,
we
can
deﬁne
Θ0
by
requiring
that
the
pull-back
via
the
identity
section
be
trivial.
For
arbitrary
d,
we
consider
μd
:
J
d
→
J
0
given
by
composing
the
map
50
“multiplication
by
χ”
from
J
d
to
J
dχ
with
the
map
“subtract
oﬀ
ω
⊗d
”
from
J
dχ
to
J
0
.
Then
we
deﬁne
Θd
to
be
(
χ12
)μ∗d
Θ0
.
Note
that
if
χ
divides
d,
with
χ
=
N
d,
then
Θd
=
the
pull-back
of
Θ0
via
the
map
“subtract
oﬀ
ω
⊗N
”
from
J
d
to
J
0
.
When
d
is
ﬁxed,
we
shall
often
omit
it
in
the
symbol
Θd
.
§5.10.

Moreover,
for

P

and

(For
convenience,
we
shall
write

Thus
via
pull-back,
we
obtain
a
ﬁltration,

The
Main
Fibration
§6.1.
In
this
Section,
we
study
the
“the
main
ﬁbration”
deﬁned
in
§5.
We
construct
various
maps
from
Hurwitz-type
schemes
into
G,
and
use
these
to
prove
some
facts
about
the
Picard
group
of
the
Hurwitz
scheme
and
of
G.
(Here
d
is
ﬁxed,
and
so
we
write
G
for
G
d
.)
§6A.
The
Excess
Divisors
in
the
Main
Fibration
§6.2.
We
return
to
working
over
the
ring
R
of
§1.
We
ﬁx
b,d,
and
g,
and
assume
further
that
g
≥
5,
and
that
d
>
2g
+
4.
For
simplicity
we
shall
denote
HRS
b,d
by
H
and
N
S
b,d
by
H.
Let
us
denote
by
H∼
the
open
substack
of
H
that
parametrizes
admissible
coverings
with
the
following
two
properties:
(1)
the
nodal
curve
upstairs
has
an
irreducible
component
which
is
smooth
of
genus
g;
(2)
the
genus
zero
curve
downstairs
has
at
most
two
irreducible
components.
51
Let
us
note
that
under
the
natural
map
H
→
Mg
(§3.27),
H∼
maps
into
Mg
.
On
the
+
+
other
hand,
if
we
denote
N
O
b,d
by
H
,
then
we
have
an
étale
covering
f
:
H
→
H.
Thus
def
f
is
a
Galois
covering
with
Galois
group
equal
to
Γ
=
S
b
.
We
denote
by
H+
,
H∼,+
the
pull-backs
of
H,
H∼
via
f
.
Thus
we
have
a
commutative
diagram:
+
H+

where
all
the
horizontal
arrows
are
open
immersions.
§6.3.
Let
us
note
that
the
relative
dimension
of
G
over
R
is:
2((d
+
1
−
g)
−
2)
+
g
+
3(g
−
1)
=
2d
+
2g
−
2
−
3
=
b
−
3
(by
the
Riemann-Hurwitz
formula).
But
this
is
the
dimension
(over
R)
of
H.
In
fact,
we
have
the
following
Proposition
:
There
is
a
natural
open
immersion
κ
:
H
→
G.
Proof:
Let
S
be
an
R-scheme.
Then
elements
of
H+
(S)
correspond
to
diagrams:
C
α
−→
P1S
⏐
⏐
β

γ
S
where
C
→
S
is
a
smooth
curve
of
genus
g,
and
C
→
P1S
is
a
degree
d
and
has
only
simple
ramiﬁcation.
By
assigning
to
this
element
the
triple
{(C
→
S)
∈
Mg
(S),
α∗
(OP1S
(1))
∈
J
d
(S),
(γ∗
(OP1S
(1))
→
β∗
(α∗
(OP1S
(1))))
∈
G(S)},
we
obtain
a
morphism
H+
→
G
which
is
clearly
invariant
under
the
action
of
Γ.
Hence
we
get
a
morphism
κ
:
H
→
G.
It
is
clear
from
the
deﬁnitions
and
by
looking
at
the
situation
when
S
is
the
spectrum
of
an
artinian
ring
that
κ
is
étale.
It
is
also
clear
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
κ
is
injective
on
geometric
points.
Thus
κ
must
be
an
open
immersion.
§6.4.
The
next
order
of
business
is
to
understand
what
the
complement
G
−κ(H)
looks
like.
To
do
this,
we
work
over
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
k
(that
is
an
R-algebra).
Let
C
be
a
smooth,
proper,
connected
curve
over
k,
and
let
L
be
a
line
bundle
of
degree
d
on
C.
Let
V
=
Γ(C,
L),
P
=
Pk
(V
∧
),
where
“∧”
for
us
will
always
mean
the
dual
space.
Thus
dimk
V
=
d
+
1
−
g,
dimk
P
=
d
−
g,
and
P
may
be
thought
of
as
the
space
of
eﬀective
divisors
that
give
rise
to
L.
A
map
α
:
C
→
P1k
(considered
up
to
automorphisms
of
P1k
)
such
that
α∗
(OP1S
(1))
=
L
may
be
thought
of
as
a
line
L
in
P
such
that:
52
(1)
There
doesn’t
exist
any
point
p
∈
C(k)
that
appears
in
every
divisor
in
L.
On
the
other
hand,
what
does
it
mean
to
say
that
α
has
at
most
simple
ramiﬁcation?
It
means
that
every
divisor
in
L
that
is
not
made
up
of
d
distinct
points
has
d
−
1
distinct
points,
so
only
one
point
has
coeﬃcient
not
equal
to
1,
and
that
coeﬃcient
is
2.
In
other
words,
we
must
require
that:
(2)
L
doesn’t
include
a
divisor
that
contains
3p
for
some
p
∈
C(k);
(3)
L
doesn’t
include
a
divisor
that
contains
2p
+
2q
for
some
p,
q
∈
C(k).
Now
let
G
=
the
Grassmannian
of
lines
in
P
.
Then
dimk
G
=
2(d
−
g
−
1).
Let
δG
denote
the
ample
generator
of
the
Picard
group
of
G.
If
we
think
of
G
as
parametrizing
rank
2
quotients
V
∧
→
Q,
then
δG
corresponds
to
∧2
Q.
Let
us
consider
the
diagram:
Δ
⊆
C


π2
C
C
(Diagram
6.1)
Let
i
be
such
that
d
−
i
>
2g
−
2.
We
consider
the
line
bundles
M(i)
=
(π1∗
L)(−iΔ).
Let
E
i
=
π2,∗
(M(i)
);
it
has
rank
d
−
g
+
1
−
i.
Let
us
denote
by
G(a
vector
bundle)
the
Grassmannian
of
2-dimensional
quotients
of
the
dual
of
the
vector
bundle.
Now
clearly
we
have
a
natural
locally
split
injection
E
1
→
E
0
which
gives
rise
to
a
morphism
ρ3
:
G(E
1
)
→
G(E
0
).
Now
E
0
is
simply
the
pull-back
to
C
of
the
k-vector
space
V
,
so
G(E
0
)
=
C
×
G.
If
we
compose
ρ3
with
the
projection
to
G,
we
obtain
a
morphism
σ3
:
G(E
1
)
→
G
which
is
clearly
generically
injective
and
whose
image
consists
precisely
of
the
lines
L
that
do
no
satisfy
(1).
Since
dimk
G(E
1
)
=
dimk
(G)
−
1,
this
image
is
some
irreducible
eﬀective
divisor
D3
,
whose
degree
we
will
compute
in
§6B.
We
also
have
a
natural
locally
split
injection
E
3
→
E
0
which
gives
rise
to
a
morphism
P(E
)
→
P(E
0,∧
)
=
C
×
P
.
If
we
then
compose
with
the
projection
to
P
,
we
get
a
morphism
ρ1
:
P(E
3,∧
)
→
P
which
is
clearly
generically
injective
and
whose
image
consists
exactly
of
the
bad
divisors
that
appear
in
(2).
The
image
in
P
is
an
irreducible
variety
V1
of
codimension
2.
Let
us
now
consider
the
incidence
variety
I
⊆
P
×
G
of
points
(p,
L)
with
p
∈
P
(k),
L
∈
G(k)
such
that
the
point
p
lies
on
the
line
L.
Then
it
is
wellknown
that
I
is
a
P1
-bundle
over
G
and
a
P(d−g−1)
-bundle
over
P
.
Denote
by
IV1
the
pull-back
of
I
(regarded
as
an
object
over
P
)
via
V1
→
P
.
Let
σ1
:
IV1
→
G
denote
the
composition
of
the
natural
inclusions
IV1
⊆
I
⊆
P
×
G
with
the
projection
to
G.
It
is
clear
(by
elementary
algebraic
geometry)
that
σ1
is
generically
injective.
On
the
other
hand,
dimk
IV1
=
dimk
(G)
−
1,
so
the
image
of
IV1
in
G
is
some
irreducible
divisor
D1
whose
points
are
exactly
the
bad
lines
that
appear
in
condition
(2).
We
shall
compute
the
degree
of
D1
in
§6B.

gives
rise
to
a
morphism
P(K(2,2),∧

→
P(K(0,0),∧

=
C

C
×
P

Composing
with
the

P
,
we
get
a
morphism
P(K(2,2),∧

P
which
is
clearly
generically
injective
after
taking
the
quotient
by
the
action
of
Z/2Z
permuting
the
two
factors
of
C,
and
whose
image
consists
exactly
of
the
bad
divisors
that
appear
in
(3).
The
image
is
an
irreducible
variety
V2
of
codimension
2
in
P
.
Forming
IV2
and
σ2
:
IV2
→
G
as
before,
we
see
that
σ2
is
generically
injective,
and
that
its
image
in
G
is
some
irreducible
divisor
D2
whose
points
are
exactly
the
bad
lines
that
appear
in
condition
(3).
We
shall
compute
the
degree
of
D2
in
§6B.
In
particular,
since
G
=
D1
D2
D3
,
we
see
that
we
can
always
construct
a
map
α
:
C
→
P1
with
at
most
simple
ramiﬁcation.
Thus
ψ
◦κ
is
surjective.
Note
that
instead
of
working
over
k,
then,
we
could
have
worked
over
J
d
.
In
summary,
we
have
the
following:
Proposition
:
The
complement
of
κ(H)
in
G
consists
of
three
relative
divisors
D1
,
D2
,
and
D3
over
J
d
,
which
are
also
geometrically
irreducible
over
J
d
.
They
correspond,
respectively,
to
the
linear
pencils
that
fail
to
meet
one
of
the
conditions
(2),(3),
or
(1)
listed
at
the
beginning
of
this
§.
§6.5.
We
now
wish
to
relate
these
divisors
of
G
to
the
divisors
of
H
constructed
in
§4.
To
do
this,
we
shall
need
to
construct
some
sort
of
map
from
H
(or
at
least
part
of
it)
into
G.
This
is
a
somewhat
delicate
task,
which
we
now
undertake.
+
We
shall
call
divisors
at
inﬁnity
of
H∼,+
or
H
that
lie
over
divisors
of
species
X
in
κ
H∼
or
H
“divisors
of
species
X”,
as
well.
We
propose
to
extend
the
map
μ
:
H+
→
H→G
to
a
map
μ
:
H∼,+
→
G.
For
any
two
distinct
integers
i
and
j
between
1
and
b,
let
us
denote
by
Uij
the
open
substack
of
H∼,+
parametrizing
admissible
covers
for
which
the
marking
sections
numbered
i
and
j
of
the
curve
downstairs
lie
in
the
irreducible
component
of
the
curve
downstairs
which
is
the
image
of
the
curve
of
genus
g
upstairs.
Then
it
is
easy
to
see
that,
as
i,
j
ranges
over
all
admissible
values,
the
union
of
the
Uij
is
all
of
54
H∼,+
,
while
the
intersection
of
the
Uij
is
H+
.
Thus,
to
deﬁne
our
extension
μ,
it
suﬃces
to
deﬁne,
on
each
Uij
,
a
morphism
Uij
→
G
that
restricts
to
μ
on
H+
.
Let
f
:
C
→
P
denote
the
universal
admissible
covering
over
H∼,+
.
Let
σ1
,
.
.
.
,
σb
:
H∼,+
→
P
denote
the
marking
sections.
Let
Ei
denote
the
schematic
inverse
image
via
f
of
σi
.
Let
C

→
H∼,+
denote
the
smooth
curve
of
genus
g
obtained
by
blowing
down
C
as
in
the
diagram
of
§3.27;
thus
we
have
a
blow-down
map
π
:
C
→
C

.
Let
Ei
denote
the
push-forward
of
the
divisor
Ei
via
π.
Since
C

is
a
regular
scheme,
Ei
deﬁnes
a
line
bundle
Li
on
C

,
along
with
a
global
section
si
of
Li
corresponding
to
Ei
.
Now
Li
deﬁnes
a
morphism
νi
:
H∼,+
→
J
d
(the
universal
Jacobian).
Since
it
is
clear
that
νi
and
νj
coincide
when
restricted
to
H+
,
it
follows
(since
H∼,+
is
separated
and
integral)
that
νi
=
νj
.
Now
it
follows
from
the
deﬁnition
of
Uij
that
over
Uij
,
the
restrictions
of
Ei
and
Ej
to
any
geometric
ﬁbre
of
C

→
H∼,+
are
distinct
divisors.
Thus,
over
Uij
,
the
pair
Ei
and
Ej
deﬁne
a
pencil,
that
is,
a
morphism
μij
:
Uij
→
G
whose
composite
with
the
projection
G
→
J
d
is
νi
=
νj
.
Clearly
this
morphism
restricts
to
μ
on
H+
.
Thus,
gluing
together
the
μij
,
we
obtain
our
μ.
The
behavior
of
μ
on
divisors
at
inﬁnity
is
given
by
the
following
Proposition
:
Suppose
that
d
>
2g
+
4.
Then
μ
maps
divisors
of
Species
1
(resp.
2,
3B
∗
)
into
D1
(resp.
D2
,
D3
);
moreover,
the
restriction
of
μ
to
the
excess
divisors
is
a
quasi-ﬁnite
morphism.
On
the
other
hand,
μ
maps
the
nonexcess
divisors
to
subsets
of
codimension
at
least
two
that
lie
outside
the
image
of
κ.
In
particular,
the
inverse
image
divisor
via
μ
of
D1
(resp.
D2
,
D3
)
is
a
positive
linear
combination
of
all
the
divisors
of
H∼,+
of
Species
1
(resp.
2,
3B
∗
).
Finally,
the
image
via
μ
of
any
excess
divisor
is
dense
in
the
restriction
of
the
corresponding
Di
to
any
geometric
ﬁbre
of
G
→
Mg
.
Proof:
First,
we
note
that
it
follows
immediately
from
the
deﬁnition
of
μ
and
the
explicit
descriptions
of
the
excess
divisors
given
in
§4
that
μ
maps
a
divisor
of
Species
1
(resp.
2,
3B
∗
)
into
D1
(resp.
D2
,
D3
);
the
assertion
on
quasi-ﬁniteness
is
also
clear
from
the
explicit
descriptions
in
§4.
Now
let
us
prove
the
ﬁnal
statement.
We
ﬁx
a
geometric
point
c
:
Spec(k)
→
Mg
,
where
k
is
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
(of
characteristic
greater
than
b).
Then
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
the
generic
point
of
Di
|c
(for
i
=
1,
2,
3)
corresponds
to
a
morphism
C
→
P1
which
appears
in
an
admissible
covering
of
Species
1,
2,
or
3B
∗
.
Let
us
ﬁrst
note
that
the
three
irreducible
divisors
Di
|c
in
G
(i
=
1,
2,
3)
are
distinct:
there
are
many
ways
to
see
this;
one
way
is
simply
to
note
that
if
any
two
were
equal,
then
their
degrees,
as
computed
in
Theorem
21
of
§6B
would
coincide;
but
an
elementary
calculation
reveals
that
this
is
absurd.
We
now
proceed
case
by
case.
For
i
=
1,
a
simple
combinatorial
check
reveals
that
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
the
generic
pencil
in
D1
|c
does
not
contain
two
divisors
each
of
which
has
a
point
of
multiplicity
three.
But
in
the
notation
of
§6.4,
this
amounts
to
checking
that
the
set
of
lines
in
P
that
pass
through
two
points
of
V1
has
codimension
at
least
two
in
G,
but
this
is
clear.
For
i
=
2,
there
are
two
points
to
check:
ﬁrst,
that
the
generic
pencil
does
not
contain
two
divisors
each
of
which
has
two
points
of
multiplicity
two;
but
this
follows
by
the
same
argument
as
in
the
previous
paragraph.
Second,
we
must
check
that
the
generic
pencil
does
not
contain
a
divisor
which
has
three
points
of
multiplicity
two;
but
the
subvariety
55
V3
⊆
P
consisting
of
divisors
with
three
points
of
multiplicity
two
has
codimension
three
in
P
(since
we
assume
that
d
>
2g
+
4).
Thus,
the
subvariety
of
G
consisting
of
lines
in
P
that
pass
through
V3
has
codimension
two,
as
desired.
For
i
=
3,
here
we
need
to
show
that
the
generic
pencil
does
not
contain
two
base
points.
But
one
sees
immediately
that
the
subvariety
of
G
corresponding
to
pencils
with
two
base
points
has
dimension
2(d
−
3)
+
2
=
2d
−
4,
i.e.,
has
codimension
two
in
G,
as
desired.
We
now
turn
to
considering
the
nonexcess
divisors.
Let
us
suppose
that
x
:
Spec(k)
→
H∼,+
is
a
geometric
point
that
lands
in
a
nonexcess
divisor.
One
piece
of
information
of
an
admissible
covering
that
is
clearly
preserved
by
μ
is
the
unique
nonconstant
morphism,
which
we
shall
henceforth
refer
as
the
central
morphism
of
the
admissible
covering,
from
the
curve
of
genus
g
upstairs
to
a
copy
of
P1
downstairs.
Thus,
let
us
suppose
that
μ(x)
lands
inside
the
image
of
κ.
Then
the
central
morphism
of
x
must
be
ramiﬁed
over
b
distinct
points
downstairs;
but
since
the
curve
downstairs
in
the
admissible
covering
x
is
stable,
this
could
only
happen
if
the
curve
downstairs
in
x
is,
in
fact,
smooth,
which
contradicts
the
assumption
that
x
lies
in
a
nonexcess
divisor.
Thus,
μ(x)
must
land
inside
one
of
the
Di
.
Now
let
us
suppose
that
μ(x)
lands
in
a
suﬃciently
generic
point
of
Di
.
Then
by
our
proof
of
the
ﬁnal
statement
of
the
Proposition,
it
follows
that
the
central
morphism
of
x
is
ramiﬁed
over
exactly
b
−
1
distinct
points
downstairs;
thus,
since
the
curve
downstairs
in
the
admissible
covering
x
is
stable,
it
follows
by
the
same
reasoning
as
before,
that
the
curve
downstairs
in
x
must
be
of
type
(b
−
2,
2).
On
the
other
hand,
we
gave
explicit
descriptions
in
§4
of
all
the
divisors
of
type
(b
−
2,
2);
going
down
the
list,
one
sees
that
the
only
possiblity
now
for
the
nonexcess
divisor
in
which
x
sits
is
Species
3B
with
g1
=
g,
g2
=
0.
But
if
d2
>
1,
then
the
central
morphism
of
x
must
have
at
least
two
base
points,
which
contradicts
what
we
just
saw
in
the
previous
paragraph.
§6.6.
At
this
point,
we
need
to
employ
a
result
which
will
not
be
proven
until
the
end
of
§7.
We
state
it
here
for
ease
of
reference:
Theorem
:
Under
the
assumption
that
d
>
2g
+
4,
the
line
bundles
deﬁned
by
D1
,
D2
,
and
D3
are
linearly
independent
in
the
Picard
group
of
G.
§6.7.
Now
by
elementary
algebraic
geometry,
we
have
an
exact
sequence:
ZD1

If

that

then
we

(again

Corollary
:

Corollary
:

The

Remark
:
Suppose
we
knew
a
priori
or
through
some
other
technique
that
P
ic
(H)
is
ﬁnite.
Then
what
we
have
done
here
would
prove
that
P
icQ
G
has
dimension
3.
This,
in
turn,
would
allow
us
to
rederive
in
a
more
algebraic
way
many
of
the
cohomological
results
of
Harer
(up
to
torsion)
which
were
recalled
in
§5.3.
Given
all
the
explicit
calculations
done
in
the
paper,
it
does
not
seem
unreasonable
to
expect
that
one
could,
by
closer
examination,
prove
that
P
ic
(H)
is
ﬁnite
in
an
a
priori
fashion.
At
the
present
time,
however,
the
author
has
not
succeeded
in
doing
this.

Returning
to
the
situation
over
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
k
as
in
the
beginning
of
§6.4,
the
purpose
of
this
Subsection
is
to
compute
the
“degree”
of
the
divisors
D1
,
D2
,
and
D3
in
G,
where
by
“degree”,
we
really
mean
the
number
N
such
that
a
divisor
is
⊗N
.
We
begin
by
reviewing
some
basic
facts
about
the
geometry
of
linearly
equivalent
to
δG
Grassmannians.
§6.10.
Lemma
:
Let
X
⊆
P
be
an
irreducible
variety
of
codimension
2.
Then
if
we
construct
IX
and
the
associated
generically
injective
morphism
IX
→
G
as
in
§6.4,
the
degree
of
the
image
of
this
morphism
in
G
is
equal
to
the
degree
of
X
in
P
.
Proof:
Let
e
=
the
degree
of
X
in
P
.
Then
one
knows
(e.g.
from
[14])
that
if
one
selects
a
linear
subspace
Q
⊆
P
of
dimension
2
and
a
point
q
∈
Q,
the
subvariety
of
G
formed
of
lines
in
Q
that
pass
through
q
gives
rise
to
a
cycle
which
is
dual
to
δG
.
Thus
it
suﬃces
to
intersect
X
with
a
generic
linear
subspace
Q
⊆
P
of
dimension
2
such
that
X
Q
has
e
points
{x1
,
.
.
.
,
xe
},
and
to
choose
a
generic
q
∈
Q
that
doesn’t
sit
on
any
line
passing
through
two
of
the
xi
’s.
Then
clearly
there
are
exactly
e
lines
in
Q
that
pass
through
q
and
intersect
X,
and
moreover,
the
intersection
between
the
image
of
IX
in
G
and
the
cycle
associated
to
{Q,
q}
is
clearly
transverse.
Hence
the
Lemma.
§6.11.
Let
S
be
a
smooth,
proper,
connected
curve
over
k;
let
E
be
a
vector
bundle
of
rank
r
+

on
S.
We
use
the
Chow
rings
Ai
(−).
Write

=
c1
(E)
∈
A1
(S).
Let
P1
=
P(E),
L1
=
OP1

Then
we
have
an
exact
sequence
0

F

EP1
→
L1
→
0,
where
the
subscript
denotes
pull-back
and
F
is
deﬁned
by
this
exact

Let
P2
=
P(F),
L2
=
OP2

On
the
other
hand,
let
G
=
G(E),
and
let
Q
be
the
universal
quotient
of
E
on
G
.
Let
P3
=
P(Q),
L3
=
OP3
(1).
Then
clearly
P2
∼
=
P3
,
with
L1
and
L3
corresponding
under
this
isomorphism.
We
thus
have
a
diagram:

Let

for

Then
we
have
A∗

so
κN

A∗

Note
that
if

we
have

so

In

set
G

Recall
our

Clearly

(i.e.,
the

Suppose

Since
here

The
result
thus
is
a
consequence
of
the
following:
§6.16.

Proof:
Referring
to

we
see
that
we
have
exact
sequences:

Since

the

follows.

it
suﬃces
to

the

in
the
relevant
part
of
§6.4).
Since
ρ∗1

Thus
if

α

and
V1

§6.22.
Let
us
consider
the
morphism
μ
:
H∼,+
→
G
constructed
in
§6.5.
Now
H+
⊆
H∼,+
as
an
open
subscheme,
and
the
complement
of
this
open
subscheme
consists
of
certain
divisors
at
inﬁnity.
In
this
Subsection,
we
wish
to
compute
the
indices
of
ramiﬁcation
of
μ
at
the
excess
divisors.
These
computations
will
be
important
for
§7.
Note
that
we
continue
to
assume
here
that
g
≥
5
and
d
>
2g
+
4.
61
Note
that
all
this
is
taking
place
over
Z[
N1
],
where
N
=
b!.
On
the
other
hand,
G
is
deﬁned
over
Z,
which
prompts
the
question:
What
is
the
nature
of
the
ramiﬁcation
of
κ
μ
:
H+
→
H−→G,
over
the
primes
p
dividing
N?
In
fact,
we
shall
see
that
there
is
no
ramiﬁcation
at
the
odd
primes.
§6.23.
We
begin
with
the
ramiﬁcation
of
μ
at
the
excess
divisor
of
Species
2.
Note
that
in
this
case,
the
diﬀerent
(though
not
the
discriminant)
is
étale
over
the
base;
thus,
the
process
of
“ordering
the
sections”
gives
rise
to
a
covering
of
G
which
is
étale
over
D2
.
Let
f
:
C
→
P
denote
the
universal
admissible
covering
over
H∼,+
.
Let
σ1
,
.
.
.
,
σb
:
H∼,+
→
P
be
the
b
marking
sections;
suppose
that
σi
lifts
to
ρi
:
H∼,+
→
C,
at
which
f
is
simply
ramiﬁed.
Let
℘
be
a
prime
divisor
of
height
one
of
H∼,+
which
“is”
a
divisor
at
inﬁnity
of
Species
2.
Let
U
be
an
open
substack
of
H∼,+
that
contains
℘
and
is
so
small
that
the
normal
sheaves
of
the
σb
(which
are
line
bundles
on
H∼,+
)
are
trivial
when
restricted
to
U
.
Choose
trivializations
τ1
,
.
.
.
,
τb
for
these
normal
sheaves
over
U
.
Let
U

→
U
be
the
étale
covering
that
parametrizes
trivializations
of
the
normal
sheaves
of
the
ρi
whose
squares
are
the
trivializations
τi
.
Let
℘
be
a
prime
of
U

that
lies
over
℘.
Note
that
with
this
extra
rigidiﬁcation,
a
generic
admissible
covering
of
Species
2
loses
all
its
automorphisms,
so
that
U

is
a
scheme
in
a
neighborhood
of
℘
.
Let
A
be
the
completion
of
U

at
℘
.
It
is
thus
clear
from
the
general
theory
of
algebraic
stacks
and
their
associated
coarse
moduli
spaces
(see,
e.g.,
[11],
p.
23)
that
to
determine
the
desired
index
of
ramiﬁcation,
we
must
simply
do
the
following:
consider
the
group
Γ
=
Gal(U

/U
)
∼
=
(Z/2Z)b
that
acts
on
the
added
structure
of
choosing
“speciﬁc
square
roots
of
uniformizers
over
points
of
simple
ramiﬁcation”.
The
inertia
subgroup
I
at
℘
is
isomorphic
to
(Z/2Z)
and
sits
inside
the
(Z/2Z)2
⊆
Γ
that
corresponds
to
the
two
points
of
simple
ramiﬁcation
on
the
P1
’s
upstairs.
Then
from
the
equivalent
deﬁnition
of
A
as
the
solution
to
a
certain
inﬁnitesimal
moduli
problem,
we
see
that
I
acts
nontrivially
on
A.
Let
B
=
AI
,
the
ring
of
invariants.
Then
B
is
also
a
discrete
valuation
ring,
and
the
desired
index
of
ramiﬁcation
is
the
the
same
as
that
of
A
over
B.
Looking
at
the
explicit
description
given
in
[19],§4,
p.
62,
however,
we
see
that
I
takes
some
uniformizer
of
A
to
minus
itself;
hence
the
index
of
ramiﬁcation
must
be
2.
Proposition
:
μ
has
ramiﬁcation
index
2
at
excess
divisors
of
Species
2.
§6.24.
Let
us
now
note
that
H∼,+
is
already
a
scheme
at
the
generic
points
of
divisors
of
Species
1
and
3B
∗
;
indeed,
for
those
Species,
once
we
order
the
points,
there
are
no
automorphisms.
Now
since
generically,
in
the
case
of
either
of
these
excess
divisors,
at
most
two
of
the
b
sections
come
together
as
one
degenerates
from
an
ordinary
Hurwitz
covering,
it
is
clear
that
the
ramiﬁcation
index
is
either
1
or
2.
Thus,
to
show
that
in
both
of
these
cases
the
ramiﬁcation
index
is,
in
fact,
2,
it
suﬃces
to
construct
one
example
where
S
=
Spec
C[[x]],
C
→
S
a
proper,
smooth
curve
of
genus
g,
with
a
diagram:
Cη
fη
−→
P1η
⏐
⏐


η
62
⊆
S
such
that
fη
is
an
ordinary
Hurwitz
covering
which
generates
to
a
covering
of
Species
1
or
3B
∗
and
such
that
if
T
=
S
×G
H∼,+
,
then
T
→
S
is
ramiﬁed.
§6.25.
We
construct
such
examples
using
the
theory
of
vanishing
cycles
reviewed
in
the
Appendix
to
§4.
Let
S
=
Spec
R,
with
R
=
C[[x]],
Ri
=
C[[xi
]]
⊆
R
for
i
a
natural
number,
Si
=
Spec
Ri
.
Choose
distinct
nonzero
complex
numbers
λ2
,
.
.
.
,
λb−1
and
denote
the
corresponding
sections
of
P1
by
σ2
,
.
.
.
,
σb−1
.
We
will
later
subject
the
complex
numbers
λi
to
a
further
condition
which
the
generic
choice
of
λi
’s
will
fulﬁll
(assuming
d
to
be
large).
By
abuse
of
notation,
we
also
denote
by
σ2
,
.
.
.
,
σb−1
the
sections
pulled
back
to
S1
,
S2
,
and
S3
.
Write
C[[T
]]
for
the
completed
local
ring
at
the
point
0
of
P1C
.
Let
(for
i
=
0,
1)
σi
be
the
section
of
P1S3
which
is
the
graph
of
the
map
S3
→
P1C
given
by
T
→
(−1)i
X
3
.
Let
τ
be
the
unique
nontrivial
element
of
the
Galois
group
of
S3
over
S6
.
Then
τ
(σi
)
=
σ1−i
for
i
=
0,
1,
which
τ
(σi
)
=
σi
for
i
≥
2.
Denote
by
ηi
the
generic
point
of
Si
.
Now
if
Gi
=
Gal
(k(η)/k(ηi
)),
where
k(η)
=
k(η
i
)
for
all
i,
then
we
have
G1
⊆
G3
⊆
G6
,
and
G1
⊆
G2
⊆
G6
.
Choosing
a
root
of
unity,
we
get
isomorphisms
Gi
∼
=
Z∧
for
all
i.
Let
ζi
be
the
canonical
generator
of
Gi
under
this
isomorphism.
Then
ζ62
=
ζ3
,
ζ63
=
ζ2
,
ζ66
=
ζ1
.
Moreover
ζ6
acts
like
τ
on
the
σi
’s.
“Drawing”
paths
around
the
σi
’s,
we
see
that
the
fundamental
group
Γ
of
P1η
−
{σ0
,
σ1
,
.
.
.
,
σb−1
}
=
Uη
may
be
described
as
the
(proﬁnite
completion
of
the)
free
group
on
generators
g0
,
g1
,
.
.
.
,
gb−1
modulo
the
sole
relation
g0
g1
g2
.
.
.
gb−1
=
1.
A
simple
calculation
reveals
the
action
of
ζ6
on
Γ
is
given
by
g0
→
g0
,
g1
→
g1−1
g0
g1
,
gi
→
gi
for
i
≥
2.
A
connected
étale
covering
of
Uη
of
degree
d
is
deﬁned
by
a
transitive
action
of
Γ
on
the
set
{1,
.
.
.
,
d}
of
d
elements.
This
covering
is
rational
over
ηi
if
and
only
if
the
action
of
Γ
obtained
by
composing
the
original
action
with
the
automorphism
of
Γ
deﬁned
by
ζi
is
the
same
as
the
original
action.
Finally,
note
that
the
subscheme
σ0
σ1
of
P1S3
descends
to
a
closed,
irreducible
subscheme
of
P1S6
,
which,
as
an
S6
-scheme,
is
isomorphic
to
S3
,
hence
ramiﬁed
over
S6
.
The
Case
of
Species
1
:
Choose
a
transitive
sequence
of
b
transpositions
in
S
d
whose
product
is
1
to
assign
consecutively
to
g0
,
.
.
.
,
gb−1
,
such
that
the
ﬁrst
two
transpositions
are
(12).
We
assume
that
the
λi
’s
are
chosen
such
that
the
curve
of
genus
g
in
the
special
ﬁbre
over
S
in
the
covering
deﬁned
by
this
sequence
of
transpositions
has
no
nontrivial
automorphisms.
(This
will
always
be
possible
for
d
>
2g
+
4
by
Proposition
5.)
Clearly
ζ6
acts
trivially
on
this
homomorphism
from
Γ
to
S
d
,
so
we
get
the
example
desired
over
S6
.
The
Case
of
Species
3B
∗
:
Choose
a
transitive
sequence
of
transpositions
as
above
that
gives
rise
this
time
to
Species
3B
∗
,
with
the
ﬁrst
transposition
being
(12)
and
the
second
(23).
Again
we
assume
the
λi
’s
and
sequence
of
transpositions
chosen
so
that
the
curve
of
genus
g
in
the
special
ﬁbre
over
S
has
no
nontrivial
automorphisms.
A
simple
calculation
reveals
that
ζ2
acts
trivially
on
the
induced
homomorphism
from
Γ
to
S
d
,
so
we
obtain
the
desired
example
over
S2
.
We
have
thus
proven
the
following
Proposition
:
μ
has
ramiﬁcation
index
2
at
divisors
of
Species
1
and
3B
∗
.
63
§6.26.
Corollary
:
Assuming
still
that
g
≥
5
and
d
>
2g
+
4,
HROb,d
and
HU
Ob,d
are
geometrically
connected.
Proof:
We
treat
the
rigidiﬁed
case;
the
unrigidiﬁed
case
is
analogous.
If
not,
there
would
be
a
nontrivial
maximal
unramiﬁed
extension
between
HROb,d
and
HRS
b,d
,
but
our
explicit
computation
of
the
ramiﬁcation
shows
that
this
is
impossible.
The
result
thus
follows
from
the
corresponding
result
for
HRS
b,d
(§2).
Remark
:
The
referee
has
informed
me
that
this
last
result
was
obtained
by
Clebsch
directly
via
purely
combinatorial
methods
similar
to
those
used
in
§2.
§6.27.
In
closing,
we
shall
prove
the
following:
Proposition
:
μ
is
unramiﬁed
over
all
odd
primes
p
of
Z.
Proof:
As
G
is
regular,
it
suﬃces
to
show,
by
the
purity
theorem,
that
there
exists
a
geometric
point
of
H
of
any
odd
characteristic
such
that
the
covering
of
this
geometric
point
induced
by
H+
→
H
is
étale.
(Here
we
note
that
H
can
be
deﬁned
over
Z
as
the
complement
in
G
of
the
three
divisors
D1
,
D2
,
and
D3
,
which
are
clearly
deﬁned
and
proper
over
Z.)
Translated,
this
means
that
given
an
algebraically
closed
ﬁeld
k
of
odd
characteristic
p,
we
must
ﬁnd
a
smooth,
proper,
connected
curve
C
over
k
and
a
morphism
f
:
C
→
P1k
of
degree
d
such
that
the
discriminant
of
f
is
étale
over
k.
But
this
clearly
follows
from
the
analysis
of
§4,
which
works
so
long
as
k
has
odd
characteristic.
Remark
:
It
was
the
goal
of
this
Subsection
to
determine
the
indices
of
ramiﬁcation
of
μ
at
all
the
primes
of
height
one
of
G
(over
Z).
We
have
thus
completed
this
task
at
all
primes
except
2,
where
there
is
wild
ramiﬁcation,
thus
making
our
goal
at
this
prime
beyond
the
scope
of
this
paper.
§7.
The
Coeﬃcient
Matrix
§7.1.
In
this
Section
we
shall
complete
the
proof
of
Theorem
8
of
§4
by
showing
that
the
excess
divisors
in
G
are
linearly
independent
in
P
ic(G),
and,
in
the
process,
we
shall
explicitly
compute
the
coeﬃcients
of
λ,
Θ,
and
γ
in
terms
of
D1
,
D2
,
and
D3
.
This
also
gives
us
explicitly
the
“main
ﬁltration”
(§5.10)
in
terms
of
the
Di
’s.
We
can
thus
check
the
coeﬃcients
of
λ
and
Θ
by
making
sure
that
they
are
in
the
kernel
of
the
map
F
3
→
F
3
/F
2
∼
=
Q
δG
,
which
was
computed
explicitly
in
§6B.
As
usual,
it
suﬃces
to
work
over
the
complex
ﬁeld
C,
so
we
will
do
that
in
this
Section.
§7.2.
Let
us
note,
ﬁrst
of
all,
that
there
exists
a
proper,
smooth,
connected
curve
S
+
(over
C)
with
the
following
property:
there
exist
enough
morphisms
φi
:
S
→
H
that
avoid
nonexcess
divisors
so
that
if
we
write
ψi
:
S
→
G
for
the
morphism
induced
by
composing
φi
with
κ,
then
the
matrix
{deg(ψi∗
Fj
)},
where
j
=
1,
2,
3;
F1
=
λ;
F2
=
Θ;
F3
=
γ,
is
of
rank
three.
Indeed,
we
can
prove
the
existence
of
such
an
S
as
follows.
First,
64
take
any
nonconstant
morphism
f

:
S

→
Mg
,
where
S

is
a
proper,
smooth,
connect
curve
(over
C).
(To
see
the
existence
of
such
an
f

,
consider
the
Satake
embedding
Mg
→
PN
of
the
coarse
moduli
space
Mg
;
since
the
divisors
at
inﬁnity
of
Mg
map
to
subsets
of
codimension
≥
2
in
the
closure
M
g
of
Mg
in
PN
,
one
can
construct
a
proper
curve
inside
Mg
by
cutting
by
hyperplane
sections.)
Let
G
=
G
×Mg
S

.
Now
it
follows
from
our
explicit
analysis
of
P
icQ
(G)
that
the
natural
morphism
P
icQ
(G)
→
P
icQ
(G
)
is
injective.
Moreover,
it
follows
from
Proposition
5
of
§4
that
the
inverse
images
via
G
→
G
of
the
images
via
μ
of
the
nonexcess
divisors
are
of
codimension
at
least
two
in
G
.
Thus,
it
suﬃces
to
prove
the
original
statement
for
G
instead
of
G;
but
since
G
is
clearly
a
projective
scheme,
the
existence
of
S
and
the
ψi
follows
by
reducing
to
the
case
when
G
is
a
smooth,
proper
surface
(by
cutting
with
hyperplane
sections)
and
then
taking
a
basis
of
the
Q-Néron-Severi
group
of
the
surface
which
consists
of
smooth
very
ample
divisors.
The
only
remaining
technical
point
is
that
it
may
at
ﬁrst
seem
that
we
need
to
use
diﬀerent
+
curves
Si
with
ψi
:
Si
→
G
(or
G,
or
H
),
but
in
fact,
it
is
elementary
that
given
any
ﬁnite
number
of
curves
Si
,
there
exists
a
curve
S
and
ﬁnite
morphisms
αi
:
S
→
Si
.
This
completes
the
proof.
+
Let
us
ﬁx
one
such
morphism
φ
:
S
→
H
.
Now
let
us
note
that
if
we
can
prove
a
linear
relation
between
the
degrees
of
the
pull-backs
via
ψ
of
certain
line
bundles
and
divisors
from
G
for
all
φ
as
above,
then
the
relation
must,
in
fact,
hold
on
G.
Now
φ
corresponds
to
some
admissible
covering
f
∼
:
X
∼
→
P
∼
over
S.
Let
us
denote
by
σ0
,
.
.
.
,
σb−1
the
sections
S
→
P
∼
that
make
up
the
discriminant
of
f
∼
.
The
stable
curve
associated
to
p∼
:
X
∼
→
S,
which
we
shall
call
p
:
X
→
S
(obtained
as
in
§3.27),
is,
in
fact,
smooth,
and
the
only
kinds
of
degeneracies
that
occur
are
those
of
Species
1,
2,
or
3B
∗
.
Let
us
denote
by
U
⊆
X
the
complement
of
the
ﬁnite
set
of
points
that
are
the
points
of
degenerate
ramiﬁcation
in
the
ﬁbres
of
Species
3B
∗
(so
there
is
exactly
one
such
point
in
each
ﬁbre
of
Species
3B
∗
).
Then
one
sees
easily
that
f
∼
contracts
to
a
map
f
:
U
→
P
,
where
P
is
a
P1
-bundle
over
S.
Thus
we
have
a
diagram:
X
f

U
−→
⏐

π
P
S
By
abuse
of
notation,
we
also
denote
by
σi
the
push-forwards
of
the
original
σi
to
sections
of
π.
We
denote
by
τi
the
unique
section
of
X
→
S
that
lies
over
σi
and
passes
through
the
points
of
ramiﬁcation.
We
denote
by
OP
(1)
some
line
bundle
on
P
(which
we
ﬁx
for
the
entire
discussion,
but
the
choice
of
which
is
noncanonical)
whose
negative
square
is
the
relative
canonical
bundle
for
P
→
S.
(Note
that
we
may
need
to
replace
S
by
some
ﬁnite
étale
cover
of
S
in
order
for
OP
(1)
to
exist.)
Observe
that
the
square
of
the
ﬁrst
Chern
class
of
OP
(1)
is
zero.
Let
L
be
the
unique
line
bundle
on
X
such
that,
restricted
to
U
,
it
is
equal
to
f
∗
OP
(1).
By
abuse
of
notation,
we
will
similarly
write
f
∗
F
for
other
line
bundles
F
on
P
to
denote
the
unique
extension
to
X
of
the
actual
bundle
f
∗
F
on
U
.
Also,
65
let
R
=
i=0
τi
,
in
the
sense
of
divisors.
Then
we
see
that
ωX
=
(p∗
ωS
)
⊗
(f
∗
ωP/S
)(R)
and
ωX/S
=
f
∗
ωP/S
(R),
where
the
various
ω’s
denote
the
respective
canonical
bundles.
b−1
Let
hi
denote
the
height
of
the
section
σi
of
π
relative
to
OP
(1).
Thus,
on
P
,
we
have
σi
·
σj
=
hi
+
hj
.
Let
l
=
hi
.
Let
us
choose
two
distinct,
constant,
but
suﬃciently
generic
divisors
F1
and
F2
on
P
which
are
of
the
form
“the
sum
of
a
divisor
which
is
a
(suﬃciently
generic)
section
of
P
→
S
and
various
(suﬃciently
generic)
vertical
divisors”
and
which
is
such
that
OP
(1)
∼
=
OP
(F1
)
∼
=
OP
(F2
).
Let
Gi
be
the
divisor
f
−1
Fi
on
X,
∼
∼
for
i
=
1,
2,
so
that
L
=
OX
(G1
)
=
OX
(G2
).
§7.3.
We
wish
to
compute
the
following
intersection
numbers
of
divisors
on
X:
(A)
G21
=
G22
=
G1
·
G2
(B)
τi
·
G1
=
τi
·
G2
(C)
τi
·
τj
(for
i
=
j)
(D)
τi2
It
is
clear
that
it
suﬃces
to
work
locally
over
S,
i.e.,
using
local
intersection
theory.
Thus
we
let
C
=
Spec
A
with
A
the
completion
of
the
local
ring
at
some
closed
point
x
of
S
and
obtain
a
diagram
X
⊇
U
−→
⏐
⏐p

P
∼
=
P1C
π
C
which
is
the
result
of
applying
the
base
change
C
→
S
to
the
diagram
in
the
previous
§.
By
abuse
of
notation,
we
continue
to
use
the
symbols
σi
,
τi
for
the
base-changed
sections.
Also
note
that
it
suﬃces
to
compute
the
result
in
the
universal
situation
as
a
function
of
the
σi
·
σj
’s
and
that
formula
will
hold
in
general.
Finally,
note
that
(in
the
global
situation)
if
q
=
the
genus
of
S,
then
by
the
adjunction
formula,
we
have:
2(q
−
1)
=
τi2
+
τi
·
ωX
=
τi2
+
τi2
+
τi
·
(R
−
τi
)
+
τi
·
p∗
ωS
+
τi
·
f
∗
ωP/S
=
2τi2
+
τi
·
(R
−
τi
)
+
2(q
−
1)
−
2τi
·
G1
Thus,
τi2
=
−
21
τi
·
(R
−
τi
)
+
τi
·
G1
.
Hence
it
suﬃces
to
compute
(A),
(B),
and
(C)
locally.
§7.4.
We
begin
with
the
case
of
a
closed
point
x
∈
S
where
the
covering
does
not
degenerate.
Then
it
is
clear
that:
66
(A)
G1
·
G2
=
0
(B)
τi
·G1
=
0
for
most
points
x,
except
for
a
ﬁnite
number
of
special
points;
the
sum
of
the
local
intersections
over
these
points
is
hi
.
(C)
τi
·
τj
=
0
for
i
=
j.
§7.5.
Equally
simple
is
the
case
of
Species
2.
Here
we
see
that:
(A)
G1
·
G2
=
0
(B)
τi
·
G1
=
0
(since
G1
is
suﬃciently
generic)
(C)
τi
·
τj
=
0
for
i
=
j.
§7.6.
We
now
consider
the
case
of
Species
1.
By
reduction
to
the
univeral
case,
we
may
assume
that
σi
·
σj
(where
i
=
j)
is
0
except
when
{i,
j}
=
{0,
1}
in
which
case
σ0
·
σ1
=
3.
Now
we
have
the
following
formulas
for
divisors:
f
−1
(σ0
)
=
2τ0
+
E0
f
−1
(σ1
)
=
2τ1
+
E1
where
E0
,
E1
are
eﬀective
horizontal
divisors
of
X
of
degree
d
−
2
over
C.
Thus
we
get:
3
=
σ0
·
σ1
=
f∗
(τ0
)
·
σ1
=
τ0
·
f
−1
(σ1
)
=
2τ0
·
τ1
+
τ0
·
E1
.
But
it
is
clear
that
τ0
·
τ1
and
τ0
·
E1
are
both
positive
integers.
Thus
τ0
·
τ1
=
1.
Returning
to
the
general
local
case
of
Species
1,
we
see
that
if
for
some
m,
k,
σm
·
σk
=
0
while
σi
·
σj
=
0
for
all
other
combinations,
then:
(A)
G1
·
G2
=
0
(B)
τi
·
G1
=
0
(since
G1
is
suﬃciently
generic)
(C)
τm
·
τk
=
13
σm
·
σk
,
τi
·
τj
=
0
for
all
other
combinations
{i,
j}.
§7.7.
The
case
of
Species
3B
∗
is
somewhat
more
involved.
Let
us
ﬁrst
note
that
by
reduction
to
the
universal
case,
we
may
assume
that
σ0
·
σ1
=
1,
and
σi
·
σj
=
0
(for
i
=
j)
for
all
other
combinations.
Then
if
we
deﬁne
X
∼
to
be
the
scheme
obtained
from
C
as
a
result
of
two
ordinary
blow-ups
at
points
taken
in
a
certain
fashion,
then
f
will
extend
to
a
morphism
f
∼
:
X
∼
→
P
∼
which
is
everywhere
deﬁned
and
is
the
pull-back
via
C
→
S
of
the
f
∼
of
§7.2.
Let
X1
be
the
blow-up
of
X
at
the
point
of
degenerate
simple
ramiﬁcation.
Denote
by
D
the
exceptional
curve
of
this
blow-up
m
:
X1
→
X
.
Then
X
∼
is
the
blow-up
67
k
:
X
∼
→
X1
at
a
point
of
D.
Let
C1
be
the
strict
transform
of
D
in
X
∼
,
and
C2
the
exceptional
curve
of
k.
Let
h
=
m
◦
k.
Then
we
have
a

Moreover
we
have
the
sections
σi
of
π,
and
their
unique
liftings
σi∼
to
sections
of
π
◦
g;
on
(1)
the
other
hand,
we
also
have
the
sections
τi
of
p
lifting
the
σi
,
the
sections
τi
of
p
◦
m
(1)
lifting
the
τi

and
the
sections
τi∼
of
p◦
h
again
lifting
the
τi
.
Let
(for
i
=
1,
2)
Gi
and
G∼
i
be
the
respective
strict
transforms
on
X1
and
X

.
Let
L(1)
=
m∗

L
=

L(1)
,
M
=
g
∗
OP

M∼

f

M.
Now
OP
(1)·OP

=
0,
so
M·M
=
0,
and
M∼
·M∼
=

∼
∼

∼

∼
∼
But
clearly,
M∼
=
OX

(G∼

)
=
OX
∼
(G2
),
so
(G1

=
(G2

=
G1
·
G2
=
0.
On
the
other
hand,
k

D
=
C1
+
C2
and
D

=
−1,
C22
=
−1,
C1
·
C2
=

so
we
get
−1
=
C12
+
2C1
·
C2
+
C22
,
hence
C12
=
−2.
Also,
it
is
clear
that
for
i
=
1,
2,
we
have
(1)
∼
(1)
=
O(Gi

so
that

Now
L

where

Hence,

(C1

Let
us
now
note
the

easy

C1

G∼
j
=

for
all

Also,
we
see
that
h
τi
=
τi

C1

,
for
i

Thus,
τ0

Finally,

Returning
to

we
see
that

§7.8.
We
are
now
ready
to
return
to
the
global
situation
of
§7.2
and
compute
global
intersection
numbers.
Let
ν1
(resp.
ν2
,
ν3
)
denote
the
number
of
points
of
S
(with
multiplicity)
at
which
a
degeneracy
of
Species

(resp.
2,
3B

)
occurs.
Thus
ν1

=
l(b−1).
First,
we
see
that
L

L
=
G1

G2
=

hence
(f

Next,
we
have

L

l

2ν3

hence
R

(f

=

Finally,
we
have:

We
have,
after
possibly
enlarging
S,
a
morphism
α
:
S

G
corresponding
to
the
diagram
in
§7.2.
Let
δi
=

Then
by
§6C,
we
see
that
ν1

ν2

ν3

Thus
we
summarize
as

3δ1

§7.9.
Let
us
compute
λS
=
12
(ωX/S
)2
purely
in
terms
of
δ1

δ2
,
and
δ3
(and
not

We
have:

ωX/S

Now
by
the
reasoning
of
§7.2,
by
choosing
various
φ,
we
obtain
enough
possibilities
so
that
any
relation
among
line
bundles
on
G
that
holds
for
all
these
possibilities
must,
in
fact,
hold
on
G.
Thus
we
obtain
the
following:
Proposition

{(b

3(b

§7.10.
It
follows
from
the
deﬁnition

from

Note
that

Let
E
=
p∗
L.
Then
E
is
a
vector
bundle
of
rank
d
+
1
−
g
on
S.
Noting
by
Riemann-Roch
that
π∗
OP

has
degree
zero,
we
see
that
it
follows
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
(d

−
g)γS
=
2N
,
where
N
=

Let
κ
=

(ωX/S

μ
=

By

:
This
completes
our

As
remarked
previously,
we
can
check
our

by
making
sure
that
the
expressions
for
λ

Θ
go
to
zero,
while
that
for

goes
to

under
the
map:

§7.13.
We
are
now
in
a
position
to
complete
the
proof
of
Theorem
6
of
§6,
and
hence
of
its
consequences,
ﬁrst
mentioned
in
§4,
and
restated
in
§6.7.
We
wish
to
show
that
D1
,
D2
,
and
D3
are
linearly
independent
in
the
Picard
group
of
G.
But
from
the
relations
obtained
already
in
this
Section,
we
see
that
the
Q-linear
subspace
generated
by
the
excess
divisors
already
contains
a
basis
for
the
whole
space.
The
result
thus
follows
immediately.

§8.
Arithmetic
Applications
§8.1.
In
this
Section,
we
make
suggestions
about
possible
applications
of
the
material
discussed
up
till
now
to
giving
(1)
An
alternate
proof
of
the
Shafarevich
conjecture
(2)
An
eﬀective
version
of
the
Mordell
conjecture
in
the
style
of
[30].
In
particular,
we
expose
a
certain
kind
of
argument
discovered
by
the
author
that
allows
one
to
conclude
the
above
arithmetic
results
by
using
the
geometry
of
the
compactiﬁcation
of
the
Hurwitz
scheme.
The
argument
to
be
exposed,
however,
has
a
couple
of
gaps
that
the
author
has
not
been
able
to
ﬁll
in.
We
state
the
facts
necessary
to
ﬁll
in
these
gaps
as
“Wishes,”
in
the
hope
that
perhaps
some
reader
will
see
how
to
prove
them,
thus
completing
the
proposed
proofs
of
the
above
arithmetic
results.
Let
B
=
Spec
OF
,
where
OF
is
the
ring
of
integers
of
a
number
ﬁeld
F
.
Let
f
:
C
→
B
be
a
smooth
curve
of
genus
g
≥
3.
(We
assume
good
reduction
to
simplify
the
discussion,
since
this
case
already
illustrates
the
essential
problem
involved.)
§8.2.
If
f
is
hyperelliptic
(i.e.,
the
geometric
ﬁbres
of
f
are
hyperelliptic),
then
we
can
canonically
write
f
as
a
double
covering
of
P1B
,
so
that
to
every
such
f
we
can
canonically
assign
(up
to
automorphisms
of
P1B
)
a
certain
number
of
points
of
P1B
which
are
distinct
from
each
other
outside
primes
over
2.
We
can
then
conclude
the
“Shafarevich
conjecture”
for
such
hyperelliptic
curves,
i.e.,
that
only
a
ﬁnite
number
of
such
curves
exist
over
B,
by
applying
Siegel’s
theorem
on
integral
points.
If
f
is
not
hyperelliptic,
then
no
such
canonical
presentation
as
a
double
covering
exists.
Generically,
that
is,
over
F
,
we
can
write
f
as
a
Hurwitz
covering
of
P1F
,
but
then
the
problem
is
that
we
can’t
apply
Siegel’s
theorem
unless
we
know
that
the
points
of
ramiﬁcation
remain
distinct,
not
only
generically,
but
at
all
primes
outside
some
ﬁxed
ﬁnite
set.
Thus
it
is
natural
to
study
in
detail
degenerations
of
Hurwitz
coverings,
i.e.,
the
compactiﬁcation
of
the
Hurwitz
scheme,
to
see
if
one
can
get
around
this
problem.
This
was
the
original
motivation
for
this
paper.
§8.3.
We
can
add
some
canonicality
to
the
situation
if
we
insist
that
we
only
consider
⊗N
,
where
N
is
some
ﬁxed
integer.
If
we
coverings
f
:
CF
→
P1F
such
that
f
∗
O(1)
=
ωC
F
/F
⊗N
let
σ
:
Mg
→
J
N
χ
be
the
section
corresponding
to
ωC
,
and
let
K
be
such
that
the
F
/F
following
diagram
is
Cartesian:
τ
K
⏐
⏐ρ

−→
Mg
−→
J
N
χ
σ
72
G
⏐
⏐

then
ideally,
we
would
like
a
section
ζ
of
ρ
that
avoids
the
Ei
=
τ
∗
Di
,
for
i
=
1,
2,
3.
This
is
unrealistic,
however.
In
fact,
even
constructing
any
section
ζ
at
all
is
rather
diﬃcult.
At
the
other
extreme,
if
we
assume
that
the
height
(e.g.[10])
of
our
curve
is
bounded,
then
everything
becomes
trivial.
Indeed,
if
we
ﬁx
an
appropriate
metric
on
K
so
as
to
give
it
an
“integral
structure”
over
the
“compact
curve”
Spec
OF
S∞
(where
S∞
=
the
archimedean
places),
then
we
see
that
if
c
:
B
→
Mg
is
the
classifying
map
of
our
curve,
then
the
number
of
possibilities
for
the
Grassmann
bundle
c∗
K
is
bounded
as
soon
as
degAr
(c∗
λ)
(where
“degAr
”
means
the
degree
of
the
arithmetic
line
bundle)
is
bounded,
by
the
following
result
of
Faltings:
Lemma
:
The
number
of
closed
subvarieties
V
⊆
PM
B
(where
M
is
any
positive
integer),
with
π
:
V
→
B
ﬂat,
of
degree
d
(∈
N)
as
a
subvariety
over
F
of
PM
F
,
of
relative
dimension
n+1

n
over
B,
and
of
height
degAr
(π∗
[O(1)]
)
≤
M
(for
some
ﬁxed
M

∈
R)
is
ﬁnite.
Proof:
(Sketch)
The
Lemma
is
obvious
for
hypersurfaces.
But
then
one
can
easily
reduce
to
the
case
of
hypersurfaces
via
the
method
of
the
Chow
variety.
(Here
we
apply
the
Lemma
by
using
the
Plücker
embedding
for
c∗
K
and
note
that
degAr
c∗
(ρ∗
[γ]N
+1
)
≤
K
degAr
(c∗
λ)
for
some
ﬁxed
K
(independent
of
c)
and
for
N
=
relative
dimension
of
ρ).
Similarly,
since
the
total
number
of
possibilities
for
the
entire
situation
is
ﬁnite,
we
can
certainly
ﬁnd
some
ﬁnite
set
S
of
primes
of
B
such
that
we
can
always
write
curves
C
with
bounded
height
as
Hurwitz
coverings
over
B
−
S.
(In
fact,
the
Lemma
also
shows
that
the
number
of
possibilities
for
C
is,
in
this
case,
also
ﬁnite!).
§8.4.
The
problem,
then,
is
to
ﬁnd
an
intermediate
course.
First,
we
must
bound
the
number
of
possibilities
for
the
Grassmann
bundle
c∗
K
without
bounding
degAr
(c∗
λ).
If
the
Grassmann
bundle
is
associated
to
a
vector
bundle
E
which
is
“suﬃciently
indecomposable”
in
the
sense
that
it
is
parametrized
by
some
sort
of
ﬁnite
“cohomology
group”
on
the
compactiﬁed
curve
Spec
OF
S∞
(cf.
the
well-known
situation
for
indecomposable
vector
bundles
of
rank
2
on
curves
over
a
ﬁnite
ﬁeld),
then
the
number
of
possibilities
for
c∗
K
will
be
ﬁnite.
At
present,
however,
the
author
does
not
know
how
to
prove
this
sort
of
result,
so
we
merely
state
it
as
a
“wish:”
Wish
1:
The
number
of
possibilities
for
c∗
K
(as
a
Grassmann
bundle)
is
ﬁnite.
Moreover,
in
order
to
be
able
to
prove
the
Shafarevich
conjecture
as
in
the
hyperelliptic
case,
we
also
need
the
following
result:
Wish
2
:
Let
F
be
a
number
ﬁeld,
with
ring
of
integers
OF
.
Let
G
→
Spec
OF
be
a
Grassmann
bundle
with
integral
structure
at
inﬁnity.
Let
r
∈
N,
d1
,
.
.
.
,
dr
∈
N.
Fix
a
ﬁnite
set
of
closed
primes
S
⊆
Spec
OF
.
Then
there
exists
a
ﬁnite
set
of
closed
primes
(S
⊆)T
⊆
Spec
OF
with
the
following
property:
(∗)
Let
D1
,
.
.
.
,
Dr
⊆
G
be
ﬂat
divisors
over
Spec
OF
with
Di
of
degree
di
for
all
i
=
1,
.
.
.
,
r
that
are
geometrically
integral
and
distinct
outside
73
S.
Then
there
exists
a
section
σ
:
Spec
OF
→
G
that
avoids
D1
,
.
.
.
,
Dr
outside
T
.
The
result
is
known
to
be
true
in
the
following
cases:
(1)
If
G
is
a
P1
-bundle,
then
it
follows
from
Siegel’s
theorem
on
integral
points.
(2)
If
G
is
a
P2
-bundle,
then
if
we
assume
that
the
Di
are
not
only
geometrically
integral,
but
smooth,
then
it
follows
from
the
Shafarevich
conjecture
applied
to
smooth
plane
curves.
In
both
these
cases,
however,
one
should
note
that
Siegel’s
theorem
and
the
Shafarevich
conjecture
are
somewhat
stronger
than
Wish
2,
and
so
using
them
to
prove
Wish
2
is
sort
of
overkill.
At
this
point,
the
author
knows
of
no
way
to
prove
Wish
2
in
any
generality,
but
if
a
proof
could
be
given
for
Wish
1
and
Wish
2,
then
one
could
prove
the
Shafarevich
conjecture
using
the
technique
of
Hurwitz
coverings.
In
closing
we
remark
that
since
the
Shafarevich
conjecture
is,
in
fact,
known
[10],
the
number
of
possibilities
for
f
:
C
→
B
is,
in
fact,
ﬁnite,
so
we
can,
indeed,
ﬁnd
a
ﬁxed,
ﬁnite
set
of
primes
T
which
is
independent
of
F
and
such
that
we
can
write
any
f
:
C
→
B
as
a
Hurwitz
covering
outside
S.
Thus,
we
see
that
something
like
Wish
1
and
Wish
2
must
be
true,
but
to
approach
things
in
this
way
is
to
defeat
the
purpose
of
this
venture!
§8.5.
We
now
move
on
to
motivating
the
possible
application
to
an
eﬀective
form
of
the
Mordell
conjecture.
In
§7,
we
computed
the
coeﬃcients
of
λ
in
terms
of
the
Di
and
found
that
the
coeﬃcients
for
D1
and
D3
were
positive,
while
that
for
D2
was
negative.
Suppose,
however,
just
for
the
moment
that
all
three
coeﬃcients
were
positive.
Then,
since
the
Di
are
all
eﬀective
(i.e.,
in
the
sense
of
divisors,
not
in
the
sense
of
an
“eﬀective”
form
of
the
Mordell
conjecture),
there
would
exist
a
constant
K
∈
N
such
that
the
inequality
(∗1
)
Θ
≤
Kλ
would
hold
on
G.
Now
suppose
that
our
curve
f
:
C
→
B
is
ﬁxed
and
that
we
have
a
ﬁxed
line
bundle
L
on
C
of
relative
degree
d
−
1
for
some
large
d.
Then
we
have
a
diagram:
α
C
−→
⏐
⏐f

B
Jd
⏐
⏐

c
−→
Mg
where
α
is
deﬁned
on
an
S-section
τ
:
S
→
CS
by
associating
to
τ
the
line
bundle
L(τ
)
(where
τ
is
regarded
as
a
relative
divisor)
of
relative
degree
d
on
CS
.
Now
α∗
Θ
is
relatively
74
ample
on
C
and
hence
deﬁnes
a
height
hΘ
(−)
on
rational
points.
Now
if
we
pull
back
the
Grassmann
bundle
α∗
(G
→
J
)
to
a
bundle
over
C,
this
Grassmann
bundle,
which
a
priori
is
locally
trivial
only
in
the
étale
topology,
will,
in
fact,
be
locally
trivial
for
the
Zariski
topology;
thus,
if
we
are
given
a
section
σ
of
f
,
and
pull-back
this
Grassmann
bundle
further
via
σ
to
a
Grassmann
bundle
over
B,
this
bundle
over
B
will
always
have
a
section
over
B.
Thus
we
can
pull
back
the
relation
(∗1
)
via
α
◦
σ
to
obtain:
(∗2
)
hΘ
(σ)
≤
KdegAr
(c∗
λ)
Moreover,
this
holds
(with
the
same
K)
over
any
number
ﬁeld
F
and
thus
gives
us
a
relation
of
the
same
type
(only
stronger)
as
that
conjectured
by
Vojta
[24],
Appendix,
§5,
p.
176.
In
particular,
it
implies
the
Mordell
conjecture.
§8.6.
In
fact,
however,
(∗2
)
is
too
strong
and
it
is
easy
to
see
that
it
cannot
hold.
This
is
not
surprising
considering
that
after
all,
we
derived
it
using
the
incorrect
assumption
that
the
coeﬃcient
of
D2
for
λ
is
positive.
To
form
a
reasonable
conjectural
inequality
like
(∗2
),
one
must
somehow
involve
the
discriminant
of
the
base
ﬁeld.
Thus,
Vojta
conjectures:
(∗3
)
hΘ
(σ)
≤
K1
discF/Q
+
K2
where
K1
and
K2
are
constants
independent
of
F
,
and
discF/Q
is
the
“logarithmic
discriminant”
of
loc.
cit..
On
the
other
hand,
althought
the
derivation
of
§8.5
is
incorrect,
it
is
very
tempting,
since
it
“almost”
works
in
the
following
metamathematical
sense:
only
the
coeﬃcient
of
D2
is
negative,
and,
moreover,
since
d,
hence
b,
is
taken
to
be
very
large,
the
absolute
value
of
the
coeﬃcient
of
D2
is
much
smaller
than
those
of
the
other,
positive
coeﬃcients.
One
is,
thus,
tempted
to
conjecture
that
if
we
write
Gσ
for
the
Grassmann
bundle
σ
∗
α∗
(G
→
J
d
)
over
B,
and
Di,σ
for
the
various
pull-backs
of
the
Di
’s
to
divisors
of
Gσ
,
then
we
have
the
following:
Wish
3:
For
ﬁxed
F
,
we
can
choose
a
section
τ
:
B
→
Gσ
such
that
degAr
(τ
∗
D2,σ
)
is
bounded
independent
of
σ.
as
well
as:
Wish
4
:
For
variable
F
,
there
exist
K1
,
K2
∈
N
such
that
for
any
σ
over
any
F
,
there
exists
a
section
τ
:
B
→
Gσ
such
that
degAr
(τ
∗
D2,σ
)
≤
K1
discF/Q
+
K2
(so
K1
and
K2
are
independent
of
σ
and
F
).
Thus,
combined
with
the
reasoning
of
§8.5,
Wish
3
would
imply
the
ordinary
Mordell
conjecture,
while
Wish
4
would
imply
Vojta’s
generalization
(∗3
)
of
that
conjecture.
It
seems
that
Wish
3
and
Wish
4
might
not
necessarily
be
easier
to
prove
than
the
more
natural
statements
that
they
are
alleged
to
imply,
but
it
is
hoped
that
they
might
provide
an
interesting
new
perspective
on
the
problem.
