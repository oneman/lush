Abstract:
The
purpose
of
the
present
manuscript
is
to
survey
some
of
the
main
ideas
that
appear
in
recent
research
of
the
author
on
the
topic
of
applying
anabelian
geometry
to
construct
a
“global
multiplicative
subspace”
—
i.e.,
an
analogue
of
the
well-known
(local)
multiplicative
subspace
of
the
Tate
module
of
a
degenerating
elliptic
curve.
Such
a
global
multiplicative
subspace
is
necessary
to
apply
the
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
of
elliptic
curves
([Mzk1-5];
also
cf.
[Mzk6],
[Mzk7]
for
a
survey
of
this
theory)
—
i.e.,
a
sort
of
“Hodge
theory
of
elliptic
curves”
analogous
to
the
classical
complex
and
p-adic
Hodge
theories,
but
which
exists
in
the
global
arithmetic
framework
of
Arakelov
theory
—
to
obtain
results
in
diophantine
geometry.
Unfortunately,
since
this
research
is
still
in
progress,
the
author
is
not
able
at
the
present
time
to
give
a
complete,
polished
treatment
of
this
theory.

Multiplicative

and
Hodge-Arakelov
Theory
At
a
technical
level,
the
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
of
elliptic
curves
may
in
some
sense
be
summarized
as
the
arithmetic
theory
of
the
theta
function
Θ=

Un
n∈Z
and
its
logarithmic
derivatives
(U

)r
Θ.
Here,
we
think
of
the
elliptic
curve
in
question
as
the
“complex
analytic
Tate
curve”

E
=

Z
def
where
q
∈
C×
satisﬁes
|q|
<
1.
Note
that
this
representation
of
E
as
a
quotient
of
C×
induces
a
natural
exact
sequence
on
the
singular
homology
of
E:
0
→
2πi
·
Z
=
H1sing
(C×
,
Z)
→
H1sing
(E,
Z)
→
Z
→
0
We
shall
refer
to
the
subspace
Im(2πi
·
Z)
⊆
H1sing
(E,
Z)
as
the
multiplicative
subspace
of
H1sing
(E,
Z),
and
to
the
generator
1
∈
Z
(well-deﬁned
up
to
multiplication
by
±1)
of
the
quotient
of
H1sing
(E,
Z)
by
the
multiplicative
subspace
as
the
canonical
generator
of
this
quotient.
It
is
not
diﬃcult
to
see
that
the
multiplicative
subspace
and
canonical
generator
constitute
the
essential
data
necessary
to
represent
the
theta
function
as
a
series
in
q
and
U
.
Without
this
representation,
it
is
extremely
diﬃcult
to
perform
explicit
calculations
concerning
Θ
and
its
derivatives.
Indeed,
it
is
(practically)
no
exaggeration
to
state
that
all
the
main
results
of
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
are,
at
some
level,
merely
formal
consequences
of
this
series
representation
—
i.e.,
of
the
existence
of
the
multiplicative
subspace/canonical
generator
(and
its
arithmetic
analogues).
Since,
ultimately,
however,
we
wish
to
“do
arithmetic,”
it
is
necessary
to
be
able
to
consider
the
analogue
of
the
above
discussion
in
various
arithmetic
situations.
The
most
basic
arithmetic
situation
in
which
such
an
analogue
exists
is
the
def
following.
Write
A
=
Z[[q]]
⊗Z
Q[q
−1
]
(where
q
is
an
indeterminate).
Write
E
=
‘Gm
/q
Z
’
def
for
the
Tate
curve
over
A.
Then
the
structure
of
E
as
a
(rigid
analytic)
quotient
of
Gm
gives
rise
to
an
exact
sequence
0
→
μd
→
E[d]
→
Z/dZ
→
0
involving
the
group
scheme
E[d]
(over
A)
of
d-torsion
points,
for
some
integer
d
≥
1.
This
exact
sequence
is
a
“q-analytic”
analogue
of
the
complex
analytic
exact
sequence
considered
above.
We
shall
refer
to
the
image
Im(μd
)
⊆
E[d]
(respectively,
generator
1
∈
Z/dZ,
well-deﬁned
up
to
multiplication
by
±1)
as
the
multiplicative
subspace
(respectively,
canonical
generator)
of
E[d].
Since
much
of
the
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
of
elliptic
curves
deals
with
the
values
of
Θ
and
its
derivatives
on
the
d-torsion
points,
it
is
not
surprising
that
this
multiplicative
subspace/canonical
generator
play
an
important
role
in
HodgeArakelov
theory,
especially
from
the
point
of
view
of
“eliminating
Gaussian
poles”
(cf.
[Mzk2];
[Mzk6],
§1.5.1).

Note
that
by
pulling
back
the
objects
constructed
above
over
A,
one
may
construct
a
multiplicative
subspace/canonical
generator
for
any
Tate
curve
over
a
p-adic
local
ﬁeld,
e.g.,
a
completion
Fp
of
a
number
ﬁeld
F
at
a
ﬁnite
prime
p.
Ultimately,
however,
to
apply
Hodge-Arakelov
theory
to
diophantine
geometry,
it
is
necessary
to
construct
a
multiplicative
subspace/canonical
generator
not
just
over
such
local
ﬁelds,
but
globally
over
a
number
ﬁeld.
It
turns
out
that
this
is
a
highly
nontrivial
enterprise,
which
requires,
in
an
essential
way,
the
use
of
anabelian
geometry,
as
will
be
described
below.
Section
2:
Basepoints
in
Motion
In
this
§,
we
let
F
be
a
number
ﬁeld
and
consider
an
elliptic
curve
E
over
G
=
Spec(F
)
with
bad,
multiplicative
reduction
at
a
ﬁnite
prime
pG
of
F
.
Write
def
N
→G
∼
for
the
ﬁnite
Galois
étale
covering
of
trivializations
(Z/dZ)2
→
E[d]
of
the
ﬁnite
étale
group
scheme
of
d-torsion
points
E[d];
denote
the
ﬁnite
étale
local
system
determined
by
E[d]
over
G
(respectively,
N
)
by
EG
(respectively,
EN
).
Also,
for
simplicity,
we
assume
that
N
is
connected
(an
assumption
which
holds,
for
instance,
whenever
d
is
a
power
of
a
suﬃciently
large
prime
number).
∼
Note
that
there
is
a
tautological
trivialization
(Z/dZ)2
→
E[d]
of
E[d]
over
N
.
By
applying
this
tautological
trivialization
to
the
elements
“(1,
0)”
and
“(0,
1),”
respectively,
we
obtain
—
just
as
a
matter
of
“general
nonsense,”
i.e.,
without
applying
any
diﬃcult
results
from
anabelian
geometry
—
a
submodule/generator
(of
the
quotient
by
the
submodule)
of
EN
.
Now,
let
us
choose
a
prime
of
N
p
lying
over
pG
with
the
property
that
this
submodule/generator
coincides
with
the
multiplicative
subspace/canonical
generator
(cf.
§1)
at
pG
.
(One
veriﬁes
easily
that
such
a
p
always
exists.)
Denote
this
data
of
submodule/generator
of
EN
by:
L,N
⊆
EN
;
γ,N
Note
that
although
the
restricted
data
L,N
|p
;
γ,N
|p
is
(by
construction)
multiplicative/canonical
at
p
,
at
“most”
of
the
primes
pN
of
N
lying
over
pG
,
the
restricted
data
will
not
be
multiplicative/canonical.
Thus:

At
ﬁrst
glance,
the
goal
of
constructing
a
submodule/generator
which
is
“always
multiplicative/canonical”
globally
over
all
of
N
appears
to
be
hopeless.
In
fact,
however,
in
the
theory
of
[Mzk16],
we
wish
to
think
about
things
in
a
diﬀerent
way
from
the
“naive”
approach
just
described.
Namely,
in
addition
to
the
original
(set-theoretic)
universe

in
which
we
have
been
working
up
until
now
—
which
we
shall
also
often
refer
to
as
the
“base
universe”
—
we
would
also
like
to
consider
another
distinct,
independent
universe
in
which
“equivalent/analogous,
but
not
equal”
objects
are
constructed.
This
analogous,
but
distinct
universe
will
be
referred
to
as
the
reference
universe:

The
analogous
objects
belonging
to
the
reference
universe
will
be
denoted
by
a
subscript
:
e.g.,
G
,
N
,
etc.
Then
instead
of
thinking
of
the
primes
pN
of
N
which
lie
over
pG
as
primes
at
which
one
is
to
restrict
L,N
;
γ,N
to
see
if
they
are
canonical
(i.e.,
multiplicative/canonical),
we
think
of
these
points
as
parametrizing
the
possible
relationships
between
the
N
of
the
“original
universe”
and
the
N
of
the
“reference
universe.”
That
is
to
say,
assuming
for
the
moment
that
there
is
a
canonical
identiﬁcation
between
G
and
G
—
a
fact
which
is
not
obvious
(or
indeed
true,
without
certain
further
assumptions
—
cf.
Example
3.2
in
§3
below),
but
is,
in
fact,
a
highly
nontrivial
consequence
of
the
methods
introduced
in
§3
—
then
pN
parametrizes
that
particular
relationship
“α[pN
;
p
]”
(well-deﬁned
up
to
an
ambiguity
described
by
the
action
of
the
decomposition
subgroup
in
Gal(N
/G)
determined
by
pN
)
between
N
,
N
that
associates
the
prime
pN
of
N
to
the
prime
p
of
N
.
Moreover:
Relative
to
the
relationship
“α[pN
;
p
]”
parametrized
by
pN
,
the
data
(submodule/generator)
on
N
determined
by
L,N
|pN
;
γ,N
|pN
are
multiplicative/canonical
at
the
“basepoint”
p
of
N
.

In
other
words:
By
allowing,
in
eﬀect,
the
“basepoint
in
question”
to
vary,
we
obtain
globally
canonical
data
in
the
sense
that
L,N
|pN
;
γ,N
|pN
are
always
canonical,
relative
to
the
basepoint
parametrized
by
pN
.
This
is
the
reason
why
it
is
necesary
to
introduce
the
“reference
universe”
—
i.e.,
in
order
to
have
an
alternative
arena
in
which
to
consider
a
“distinct,
independent
basepoint”
(i.e.,
p
)
from
the
“original
basepoint”
p
of
N
,
relative
to
which
the
data
in
question
becomes
canonical.
Note
that
once
one
introduces
a
distinct,
independent
reference
universe,
it
is
a
tautology
—
by
essentially
the
same
reasoning
as
that
of
“Russell’s
paradox”
concerning
the
“set
of
all
sets”
—
that
all
possible
relationships
“α[pN
;
p
]”
between
these
two
universes
do,
in
fact,
occur.
We

discussed

the

to
represent
parallel
transport
of

—
which
is
possible
since
the
local
system
EN
is
trivial,
and
N
is

On
the
other
hand,
once
one
introduces
such
a
distinct,
independent
universe,
the
task
of
relating
events
in
the
new
universe
in
an
orderly,
consistent
way
to
events
in
the
old
becomes
highly
nontrivial.
This
is
the
role
played
by
the
introduction
of
ideas
motivated
by
anabelian
geometry,
to
be
described
below
in
§3,
4.
Section
3:
Anabelioids
and
Cores
A
connected
anabelioid
is
simply
a
Galois
category
(in
the
classical
language
of
[SGA1],
Exposé
V).
In
general,
we
will
also
wish
to
consider
arbitrary
anabelioids,
which
have
ﬁnitely
many
connected
components,
each
of
which
is
a
connected
anabelioid.
Thus,
in
the
language
of
[SGA1],
Exposé
V,
§9,
an
anabelioid
is
a
multi-Galois
category.
Thus,
an
anabelioid
is
a
topos
—
hence,
in
particular,
a
(1-)category
—
satisfying
certain
properties.
Moreover,
the
ﬁnite
set
of
connected
components
of
an
anabelioid,
as
well
as
the
connected
anabelioid
corresponding
to
each
element
of
this
set,
may
be
recovered
entirely
category-theoretically
from
the
original
anabelioid.
Suppose
that
we
work
in
a
universe

in
which
we
are
given
a
small
category
of
sets
Ens.
Let
G
be
a
small
proﬁnite
group.
Then
the
category
B(G)
of
sets
in
Ens
equipped
with
a
continuous
G-action
is
a
connected
anabelioid.
In
fact,
every
connected
anabelioid
is
equivalent
to
B(G)
for
some
G.
Another
familiar
example
from
scheme
theory
is
the
following.
Let
X
be
a
(small)
connected
locally
noetherian
scheme.
Denote
by
Ét(X)
the
category
whose
objects
are
(small)
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
X
and
whose
morphisms
are
X-morphisms
of
schemes.
Then
it
is
well-known
(cf.
[SGA1],
Exposé
V,
§7)
that
Ét(X)
is
a
connected
anabelioid.
Note
that
since
an
anabelioid
is
a
1-category,
the
“category
of
anabelioids”
naturally
forms
a
2-category.
In
particular,
if
G
and
H
are
proﬁnite
groups,
then
one
veriﬁes
easily
that
the
(1-)category
of
morphisms
Mor(B(G),
B(H))
is
equivalent
to
the
category
whose
objects
are
continuous
homomorphisms
of
proﬁnite
groups
ψ
:
G
→
H,
and
whose
morphisms
from
an
object
ψ1
:
G
→
H
to
ANABELIAN
GEOMETRY
IN
HODGE-ARAKELOV
THEORY
7
an
object
ψ2
:
G
→
H
are
the
elements
h
∈
H
such
that
ψ2
(g)
=
h
·
ψ1
(g)
·
h−1
,
∀g
∈
G.
At
this
point,
the
reader
might
wonder
why
the
author
felt
the
need
to
introduce
the
terminology
“anabelioid,”
instead
of
using
the
term
“multi-Galois
category”
of
[SGA1].
The
main
reason
for
the
introduction
of
this
terminology
is
that
we
wish
to
emphasize
that
we
would
like
to
think
of
anabelioids
X
as
generalized
spaces
—
which
is
natural
since
they
are,
after
all,
topoi
—
whose
geometry
just
happens
to
be
“completely
determined
by
their
fundamental
groups”
(albeit
somewhat
tautologically!
—
cf.
the
preceding
paragraph).
This
is
meant
to
recall
the
notion
of
an
anabelian
variety,
i.e.,
a
variety
whose
geometry
is
determined
by
its
fundamental
group.
The
point
here
is
that:
The
introduction
of
anabelioids
allows
us
to
work
with
both
“algebrogeometric
anabelioids”
(i.e.,
anabelioids
arising
as
the
“Ét(−)”
of
an
(anabelian)
variety)
and
“abstract
anabelioids”
(i.e.,
those
which
do
not
necessarily
arise
from
an
(anabelian)
variety)
as
geometric
objects
on
an
equal
footing.
The
reason
that
it
is
important
to
deal
with
“geometric
objects”
B(G)
as
opposed
to
(proﬁnite)
groups
G,
is
that:
We
wish
to
study
what
happens
as
one
varies
the
basepoint
of
one
of
these
geometric
objects
(cf.
§2).
That
is
to
say,
groups
are
determined
only
once
one
ﬁxes
a
basepoint.
Thus,
it
is
diﬃcult
to
describe
what
happens
when
one
varies
the
basepoint
solely
in
the
language
of
groups.
Next,
we
introduce
some
terminology,
as
follows:
A
morphism
of
connected
anabelioids
X
→Y
is
ﬁnite
étale
if
it
is
equivalent
to
a
morphism
of
the
form
B(H)
→
B(G),
induced
by
applying
“B(−)”
to
the
natural
injection
of
an
open
subgroup
H
of
G
into
G.
A
morphism
of
anabelioids
is
ﬁnite

if
the
induced
morphisms
from
the
various
connected
components
of
the
domain
to
the
various
connected
components
of
the
range
are
all
ﬁnite
étale.
A
ﬁnite
étale
morphism
of
anabelioids
is
a
covering
if
it
induces
a
surjection
on
connected
components.
A
proﬁnite
group
G
is
slim
if
the
centralizer
ZG
(H)
of
any
open
subgroup
H
⊆
G
in
G
is
trivial.
An
anabelioid
X
is
slim
if
the
fundamental
group
π1
(Xi
)
of
every
connected
component
Xi
of
X
is
slim.
A
2-category
is
slim
if
the
automorphism
group
of
every
1-arrow
in
the
2-category
is
trivial.
In
general,
if
C
is
a
slim
2-category,
we
shall
write
|C|
SHINICHI

for
the
associated
1-category
whose
objects
are
objects
of
C
and
whose
morphisms
are
isomorphism
classes
of
morphisms
of
C.
Finite
étale
morphisms
of
anabelioids
are
easiest
to
understand
when
the
anabelioids
in
question
are
slim.
Indeed,
let
X
be
a
slim
anabelioid.
Write
Et(X
)
for
the
2-category
whose
objects
are
ﬁnite
étale
morphisms
Y
→
X
and
whose
morphisms
are
ﬁnite
étale
arrows
Y1
→
Y2
over
X
.
Then
the
2-category
Et(X
)
is
def
slim.
Moreover,
if
we
write
Ét(X
)
=
|Et(X
)|,
then
the
functor
FX
:
X
→
Ét(X
)
S
→
(XS
→
X
)
(where
S
is
an
object
of
X
;
XS
denotes
the
category
whose
objects
are
arrows
T
→
S
in
X
,
and
whose
morphisms
between
T
→
S
and
T

→
S
are
S-morphisms
T
→
T

;
XS
→
X
is
the
natural
“forgetful
functor”)
is
an
equivalence.
Next,
let
us
write
Loc(X
)
for
the
2-category
whose
objects
are
anabelioids
Y
that
admit
a
ﬁnite
étale
morphism
to
X
,
and
whose
morphisms
are
ﬁnite
étale
morphisms
Y1
→
Y2
(that
do
not
necessarily
lie
over
X
!).
Then
it
follows
from
the
assumption
that
X
is
slim
that
Loc(X
)
is
also
slim.
Write:
def
Loc(X
)
=
|Loc(X
)|
Perhaps
the
most
fundamental
notion
underlying
the
theory
of
[Mzk16]
is
that
of
a
“core.”
We
shall
say
that
a
slim
anabelioid
X
is
a
core
if
X
is
a
terminal
object
in
the
(1-)category
Loc(X
).
Here
we
make
the
important
observation
that
the
deﬁnability
of
Loc(X
)
is
one
of
the
most
fundamental
diﬀerences
between
the
theory
of
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
anabelioids
as
presented
in
the
present
manuscript
and
the
theory
of
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
from
the
point
of
view
of
“Galois
categories,”
as
given
in
[SGA1].
Indeed,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
theory
of
[SGA1],
it
is
only
possible
to
consider
“Ét(X
)”
—
i.e.,
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
and
morphisms
that
always
lie
over
X
.
That
is
to
say,
in
the
context
of
the
theory
of
[SGA1],
it
is
not
possible
to
consider
diagrams
such
as:
ANABELIAN
GEOMETRY
IN
HODGE-ARAKELOV
THEORY
9
Z

X
Y
(where
the
arrows
are
ﬁnite
étale)
that
do
not
necessarily
lie
over
any
speciﬁc
geometric
object,
as
is
necessary
for
the
deﬁnition
of
Loc(X
).
We
shall
refer
to
such
a
diagram
as
a
correspondence
or
isogeny
between
X
and
Y.
Here,
we
wish
to
emphasize
that
the
reason
that
cores
play
a
key
role
in
the
theory
of
[Mzk16]
is
that:
(Up
to
renaming)
cores
have
essentially
only
one
basepoint.
Indeed,
this
is
essentially
a
formal
consequence
of
the
deﬁnition
of
a
core.
The
reason
that
this
property
of
“having
essentially
only
one
basepoint”
is
important
is
that
it
means
that
even
if
we
consider
(cf.
the
discussion
of
§2)
distinct
copies
of
a
core
that
belong
to
distinct,
independent
universes,
we
may
still
identify
their
basepoints
without
fear
of
confusion
or
inconsistencies
—
such
as
“Russell’s
paradox”
concerning
the
“set
of
all
sets.”
That
is
to
say,
cores
allow
us
to
“navigate
between
universes”
without
“getting
lost.”
We
refer
to
this
phenomenon
as
“anabelian
navigation.”
Moreover,
even
for
(slim)
anabelioids
that
are
not
cores,
we
may
still
perform
a
sort
of
anabelian
navigation
by
“measuring
the
distance
of
such
anabelioids
from
a
core.”
Thus,
even
though
for
such
non-cores,
it
is
not
possible
to
completely
identify
basepoints
of
copies
of
the
object
belonging
to
distinct,
independent
universes
without
confusion
(as
in
the
case
of
cores),
we
can
nevertheless
identify
basepoints
of
copies
of
such
non-cores
up
to
a
controllable
ambiguity
(cf.
the
“α[pN
;
p
]’s”
of
§2),
which
is
often
suﬃcient
for
applications
that
we
have
in
mind.
Finally,
we
close
this
§
by
presenting
some
examples
of
cores
(and
non-cores),
all
of
which
are
of
central
importance
in
the
theory
of
[Mzk16].
Since
these
examples
involve
schemes,
in
order
to
discuss
them
in
an
orderly
fashion,
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
deﬁnition
of
“Loc(−)”
for
schemes,
as
well.
Let
X
be
a
connected
noetherian
regular
scheme.
Then
let
us
write
Loc(X)
for
the
(1-)category
whose
objects
are
schemes
Y
that
admit
a
ﬁnite
étale
morphism
to
X,
and
whose
morphisms
are
ﬁnite
étale
morphisms
Y1
→
Y2
(that
do
not
necessarily
lie
over
X!).

the

X

def
(where
Q
is
the
rational
number
ﬁeld;
and
Ét(Q)
=
Ét(Spec(Q))).
That
X
is
a

follows
formally
from:
(i)
the
fact
that
Spec(Q)
is
a
terminal
object
in
Loc(Q);
(ii)
the
theorem
of
Neukirch-Uchida-Iwasawa-Ikeda
(cf.
[NSW],
Chapter
XII,
§2)
on
the
anabelian
nature
of
number
ﬁelds.
Note,
on
the
other
hand,
that
if
F
is
a
number
ﬁeld
(i.e.,
ﬁnite
extension
of
Q)
which
is
not
equal
to
Q,
then
Ét(F
)
is
not
a
core.
Indeed,
this
follows
(via
the
theorem
of
Neukirch-Uchida-IwasawaIkeda)
from
the
easily
veriﬁed
fact
that
Spec(F
)
is
not
a
terminal
object
in
the
category
Loc(F
).
Example
3.2.
Non-arithmetic
Hyperbolic
Curves.
Let
K
be
a
ﬁeld
of
characteristic
0.
Let
XK
be
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
K
(i.e.,
the
complement
of
a
divisor
of
degree
r
in
a
smooth,
proper,
geometrically
connected
curve
of
genus
g
over
K,
such
that
2g
−
2
+
r
>
0).
In
fact,
more
generally,
one
may
take
XK
to
be
a
hyperbolic
orbicurve
over
K
(i.e.,
the
quotient
in
the
sense
of
stacks
of
a
hyperbolic
curve
by
the
action
of
ﬁnite
group,
where
we
assume
that
the
ﬁnite
group
acts
freely
on
a
dense
open
subscheme
of
the
curve).
Also,
we
assume
that
we
have
been
given
def
an
algebraic
closure
K
of
K
and
write
XK
=
XK
⊗K
K.
We
will
say
that
XK
is
a
geometric
core
(cf.
the
term
“hyperbolic
core”
of
[Mzk11],
§3)
if
XK
is
a
terminal
object
in
Loc(XK
)
(where,
in
the
case
of
orbicurves,
we
allow
the
objects
of
Loc(XK
)
to
be
orbicurves
that
admit
a
ﬁnite
étale
morphism
to
XK
).
We
will
say
that
XK
is
arithmetic
(cf.
[Mzk11],
§2)
if
it
is
isogenous
to
a
Shimura
curve
(i.e.,
some
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
XK
is
isomorphic
to
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
a
Shimura
curve).
As
is
shown
in
[Mzk11],
§3,
if
XK
is
non-arithmetic,
then
there
exists
a
hyperbolic
orbicurve
ZK
together
with
a
ﬁnite
étale
morphism
XK
→
ZK
such
that
ZK
is
a
geometric
core.
Moreover,
(cf.
[Mzk11],
Theorem
B)
in
the
case
of
hyperbolic
curves
of
type
(g,
r),
where
2g
−
2
+
r
≥
3,
a
general
curve
of
that
type
is
a
geometric
core.
Suppose
that
XK
is
a
geometric
core;
and
that
K
is
a
number
ﬁeld
which
is
a
minimal
ﬁeld
of
deﬁnition
for
XK
.
Then
it
follows
formally
from
the
theorem
of
Neukirch-Uchida-Iwasawa-Ikeda
(cf.
Example
3.1),
together
with
the
“Grothendieck
Conjecture
for
algebraic
curves”
(cf.
[Tama];
[Mzk13];
[Mzk15])
that
the
(slim)
anabelioid
Ét(XK
)
is
a
core.
Example
3.3.
Arithmetic
Hyperbolic
Curves.
On
the
other
hand,
an
arithmetic
curve
XK
(notation
as
in
the
last
paragraph
of
Example
3.2)
is
never
ANABELIAN
GEOMETRY
IN
HODGE-ARAKELOV
THEORY
11
a
geometric
core.
For
instance,
consider
the
hyperbolic
orbicurve
XK
given
by
the
moduli
stack
of
“hemi-elliptic
orbicurves”
(i.e.,
orbicurves
obtained
by
forming
the
quotient
(in
the
sense
of
stacks)
of
an
elliptic
curve
by
the
action
of
±1).
Then
the
existence
of
the
well-known
Hecke
correspondences
on
XK
shows
that
XK
is
“far
from
being”
a
terminal
object
in
Loc(XK
).
Thus,
in
particular,
the
(slim)
anabelioid
Ét(XK
)
will
never
be
a
core
in
this
case.
Section
4:
Holomorphic
Structures
and
Commensurable
Terminality
Sometimes,
when
considering
the
extent
to
which
an
anabelioid
is
a
core,
it
is
natural
not
to
consider
all
ﬁnite
étale
morphisms
(as
in
the
deﬁnition
of
Loc(−)),
but
instead
to
restrict
our
attention
to
ﬁnite
étale
morphisms
that
preserve
some
auxiliary
structure.
In
some
sense,
the
two
main
motivating
examples
of
this
phenomenon
are
the
following:
Example
4.1.
Complex
Holomorphic
Structures.
Let
X
be
a
hyperbolic
orbicurve
(cf.
Example
3.2)
over
the
ﬁeld
of
complex
numbers
C.
Write
X
an
for
the
associated
Riemann
surface
(or
one-dimensional
complex
analytic
stack).
Then
we
may
consider
the
“complex
analytic
analogue”
def
X
=
Étan
(X
an
)
of
Ét(X),
namely,
the
category
of
local
systems
(in
the
complex
topology)
on
X
an
.
Just
as
in
the
case
of
anabelioids,
one
may
consider
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
X
,
hence
also
the
category:
Loc(X
)
On
the
other
hand,
it
is
easy
to
see
that
this
category
is
“too
big”
to
be
of
interest.
Instead,
it
is
more
natural
to
do
the
following:
The
well-known
uniformization
of
X
an
by
the
upper
half
plane
determines
a
homomorphism
of
the
(usual
topological)
fundamental
group
π1top
(X
an
)
of
X
an
into
P
SL2
(R).
This
homomorphism
determines
a
local
system
of
P
SL2
(R)-torsors
on
X
an
,
hence
an
object
QX
∈
X
.
Then,
if
we
regard
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
Y
→
X
as
always
being
equipped
with
the
auxiliary
structure
QY
determined
by
pulling
back
QX
to
Y
and
then
deﬁne
Lochol
(X
)
to
be
the
2-category
whose
objects
are
such
(Y,
QY
)
and
whose
morphisms
(Y1
,
QY1
)
→
(Y2
,
QY2
)
are
ﬁnite
étale
morphisms
Y1
→
Y2
for
which
the
12
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
（望月
新一）
pull-back
of
QY2
is
isomorphic
to
QY1
,
then
we
obtain
a
slim
2-category
Lochol
(X
)
whose
associated
1-category
Lochol
(X
)
is
easily
seen
to
be
isomorphic
to
Loc(X)
(since
the
morphisms
of
Lochol
(X
)
always
arise
from
complex
analytic
morphisms
of
Riemann
surfaces,
which
may
be
algebrized).
In
particular,
X
is
a
geometric
core
if
and
only
if
X
is
a
terminal
object
in
Lochol
(X
).
Example
4.2.
p-adic
Holomorphic
Structures.
The
analogue
of
Example
3.1
for
Qp
does
not
hold,
since
the
(naive)
analogue
of
the
theorem
of
NeukirchUchida-Iwasawa-Ikeda
does
not
hold
for
ﬁnite
extensions
of
Qp
.
On
the
other
hand,
if
K
is
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
,
then
its
absolute
Galois
group
GK
has
a
natural
action
on
Cp
(the
p-adic
completion
of
the
algebraic
closure
of
Qp
under
consideration).
Moreover,
although
(unlike
the
case
of
number
ﬁelds)
it
is
not
∼
necessarily
the
case
that
an
arbitrary
isomorphism
GK1
→
GK2
(where
K1
,
K2
are
∼
ﬁnite
extensions
of
Qp
)
arises
from
a
ﬁeld
isomorphism
K1
→
K2
,
it
is
necessarily
∼
the
case
that
such
an
isomorphism
GK1
→
GK2
arises
from
a
ﬁeld
isomorphism
if
∼
GK1
→
GK2
is
compatible
with
the
natural
actions
of
both
sides
on
Cp
(cf.
the
theory
of
[Mzk14]).
Thus,
if
one
thinks
of
Cp
as
determining
a
(pro-ind-)object
QK
in
Ét(K),
and
deﬁnes
the
morphisms
of
Lochol
(Qp
)
to
be
morphisms
Ét(K1
)
→
Ét(K2
)
of
Loc(Qp
)
for
which
the
pull-back
of
QK2
is
isomorphic
to
QK1
,
then
Ét(Qp
)
determines
a
terminal
object
in
Lochol
(Qp
).
The
above
two
examples
motivate
the
following
approach:
Let
Q
be
a
slim
anabelioid.
Deﬁne
a
Q-holomorphic
structure
on
a
slim
anabelioid
X
to
be
a
morphism
X
→
Q.
We
will
refer
to
a
slim
anabelioid
equipped
with
a
Q-holomorphic
structure
as
a
Q-anabelioid.
A
Q-holomorphic
morphism
(or
“Q-morphism”
for
short)
between
Q-anabelioids
is
a
morphism
of
anabelioids
compatible
with
the
Q-holomorphic
structures.
Then
we
obtain
a
2-category
LocQ
(X
)
whose
objects
are
Q-anabelioids
that
admit
a
Q-holomorphic
ﬁnite
étale
morphism
to
X
,
and
whose
morphisms
are
arbitrary
ﬁnite
étale
Q-morphisms
(that
do
not
necessarily
lie
over
X
!).
Thus,
instead
of
considering
whether
or
not
X
is
a(n)
(absolute)
core
(as
in
§3),
one
may
instead
consider
whether
or
not
X
is
a
Q-core,
i.e.,
determines
a
ANABELIAN
GEOMETRY
IN
HODGE-ARAKELOV
THEORY
13
def
terminal
object
in
LocQ
(X
)
=
|LocQ
(X
)|.
Just
as
cores
“have
essentially
only
one
basepoint”:
If
X
is
a
Q-core,
then
every
basepoint
of
Q
determines
an
essentially
unique
(up
to
renaming)
basepoint
of
X
(so
long
as
the
Q-holomorphic
structures
involved
are
held
ﬁxed).
Thus,
the
theory
of
“Q-holomorphic
structures”
gives
rise
to
a
sort
of
“relative
version”
of
theory
of
cores
discussed
in
§3.
Next,
we
introduce
some
terminology,
as
follows.
A
closed
subgroup
H
⊆
G
of
a
proﬁnite
group
G
will
be
called
commensurably
terminal
if
the
commensurator
CG
(H)
=
{g
∈
G
|
(g
·
H
·
g
−1
)
def

H
has
ﬁnite
index
in
H,
g
·
H
·
g
−1
}
of
H
in
G
is
equal
to
H
itself.
An
arbitrary
morphism
of
connected
anabelioids
X
→
Y
will
be
called
a
π1
-monomorphism
(respectively,
π1
-epimorphism)
if
the
induced
morphism
on
fundamental
groups
π1
(X
)
→
π1
(Y)
is
injective
(respectively,
surjective).
A
π1
-monomorphism
X
→
Y
of
connected
anabelioids
will
be
called
commensurably
terminal
if
the
induced
morphism
on
fundamental
groups
π1
(X
)
→
π1
(Y)
is
commensurably
terminal.
Now
it
is
an
easy,
formal
consequence

Then

only

This

to
construct

That
is
to
say,
we
are
given
a

graph
Γ,
together
with,
for
each
vertex
v
(respectively,
edge
e)
of
Γ
a

Πv
(respectively,

),
and,
for
each

v
that

to
an

a

.
Denote
by
ΠG
the

associated
to
this

of

Then
we
obtain

,
Πv

(well-deﬁned
up
to

with
an

of

).
Now
let
Δ
be
a

of

Then
“restricting”
G

gives
rise
to
a

If

then
we
obtain
a

ΠΔ

Then

constructing
various

that
for

that

Then

In

for

The

Stable

Automorphisms.
Let

ﬁeld
of

0.
Let
X
be
a
stable
hyperbolic
curve
of
type

the

of

divisor
of

points
in
a
pointed
stable
curve
of
type
(g,

over
K.
Then
to
X,
one
may
associate
a
natural
graph
of
groups
GX
as
follows:
The
underlying
graph
ΓX
of
GX
is
the
dual
graph
of
X.
That
is
to
say,
the
vertices
(respectively,
edges)
of
ΓX
are
the
irreducible
components
(respectively,
nodes)
of
X,
and
an
edge
abuts
to
a
vertex
if
and
only
if
the
corresponding
node
is
contained
in
the
corresponding
irreducible
component.
If
v
(respectively,
e)
is
a
vertex
(respectively,

of
ΓX
,
then
we

to
it

the

Note
that

Here,
an

if
there

of
the

groups
associated
to
the

of

that
lie
on

respectively.
Then
it
is
not
diﬃcult
to
show
by
an
argument
involving
“weights”
as
in
[Mzk13],
§1
–
5,
that:
OutΓ
(ΠX

is
commensurably

in

may
