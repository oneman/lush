Introduction
The
goal
of
the
present
manuscript
is
to
consider
the
following
question:
To
what
extent
can
the
fundamental
group
of
a
Galois
category
be
constructed
in
a
canonical
fashion
which
is
independent
of
a
choice
of
basepoint?
Put
another
way,
we
would
like
to
consider
the
extent
to
which
the
elements
(considered,
say,
up
to
conjugation)
of
the
fundamental
group
may
be
assigned
canonical
names,
or
labels.
In
§1,
§2,
we
consider
this
issue
from
a
very
general
point
of
view.
That
is
to
say,
we
develop
the
general
theory
of
“anabelioids”
—
i.e.,
“multi-Galois
categories”
in
the
terminology
of
[SGA1]—
with
an
eye
to
giving
an
answer
to
this
question.
We
use
the
new
terminology
“anabelioid”,
partly
because
it
is
shorter
than
“(multi)Galois
category”,
and
partly
because
we
wish
to
emphasize
that
we
would
like
to
treat
such
objects
from
a
fundamentally
diﬀerent
point
of
view
—
a
point
of
view
partially
motivated
by
Grothendieck’s
anabelian
philosophy
(cf.
[Groth];
Remark
1.1.4.1
below)
—
from
the
point
of
view
taken
in
[SGA1]:
Namely,
we
would
like
to
regard
anabelioids
as
the
primary
geometric
objects
of
interest,
which
themselves
form
a
category
[i.e.,
not
as
a
category
containing
as
objects
the
primary
geometric
objects
of
interest].
Our
main
result
in
§1,
§2,
is
Theorem
2.4.3,
which
states
that:
When
an
anabelioid
possesses
a
“faithful
quasi-core”
(cf.
Deﬁnition
2.3.1),
then
its
fundamental
group
may
be
constructed
in
a
canonical
fashion
as
a
proﬁnite
group.
The
notion
of
a
“quasi-core”
is
motivated
partly
by
the
notion
of
a
“hyperbolic
core”
(cf.
[Mzk3])
and
partly
by
the
“Motivating
Example”
given
below.
The
condition
for
a
quasi-core
states,
roughly
speaking,
that
a
certain
“forgetful
functor”
from
a
category
of
geometric
objects
equipped
with
some
special
auxiliary
structure
to
the
category
of
the
same
geometric
objects
not
equipped
with
this
auxiliary
structure
is,
in
fact,
an
equivalence.
Indeed,
this
general
pattern
of
considering
such
forgetful
functors
which
are,
in
fact,
equivalences
is
an
important
theme
in
the
present
manuscript
(cf.
Deﬁnition
2.3.1,
as
well
as
Theorem
2.4.2).
One
elementary
example
of
this
sort
of
phenomenon
—
which
was,
in
fact,
one
of
the
main
motivations
for
the
introduction
of
the
notion
of
a
“quasi-core”
—
is
the
following
example
from
elementary
complex
analysis:
Motivating
Example:
Metrics
on
Hyperbolic
Riemann
Surfaces.
A
connected
Riemann
surface
is
called
hyperbolic
if
its
universal
covering
is
biholomorphic
to
the
upper
half
plane.
An
arbitrary
Riemann
surface
will
be
called
hyperbolic
if
every
connected
component
of
this
Riemann
surface
is
hyperbolic.
Let
us
write
Lochyp
THE
GEOMETRY
OF
ANABELIOIDS
3
for
the
category
whose
objects
are
hyperbolic
Riemann
surfaces
and
whose
morphisms
are
étale
morphisms
[i.e.,
holomorphic
maps
with
everywhere
nonvanishing
derivative].
If
X
∈
Ob(Lochyp
)
is
a
object
of
Lochyp
,
then
we
shall
refer
to
the
metric
on
its
tangent
bundle
determined
by
the
standard
Poincaré
metric
on
the
upper
half
plane
[which
is
biholomorphic
to
the
universal
covering
of
every
connected
component
of
X]
as
the
canonical
metric
on
X.
If
f
:
X
→
Y
is
a
morphism
in
Lochyp
,
then
we
shall
say
that
this
morphism
f
is
integral
if
the
norm
of
its
derivative
[when
measured
with
respect
to
the
canonical
metrics
on
the
tangent
bundles
of
X,
Y
]
is
≤
1.
Let
us
write
hyp
Lochyp
int
⊆
Loc
for
the
subcategory
whose
objects
are
the
objects
of
Lochyp
and
whose
morphisms
are
the
integral
morphisms
of
Lochyp
.
Then
it
follows
from
the
“theory
of
the
Kobayashi
hyperbolic
metric”
that
the
natural
inclusion
functor
hyp
Lochyp
int
→
Loc
is,
in
fact,
an
equivalence.
At
a
more
concrete
level,
one
veriﬁes
easily
that
the
essential
substantive
fact
that
one
needs
to
show
this
equivalence
is
the
well-known
Schwarz
lemma
of
elementary
complex
analysis
[to
the
eﬀect
that
any
holomorphic
function
φ
:
D
→
C
on
the
open
unit
disc
D
in
the
complex
plane
satisfying
φ(0)
=
0,
|φ(z)|
≤
1
(for
all
z
∈
D),
necessarily
satisﬁes
|φ
(0)|
≤
1].
This
lemma
of
Schwarz
in
turn
may
be
regarded
as
a
formal
consequence
of
the
well-known
“maximum
modulus
principle”
of
elementary
complex
analysis.
From
a
category-theoretic
point
of
view,
the
point
of
this
example
is
that,
although
the
object
of
Lochyp
determined
by
the
upper
half
plane
is
by
no
means
a
terminal
object
in
Lochyp
—
i.e.,
a
“core”
(cf.
the
theory
of
[Mzk3])
—
the
fact
hyp
that
the
inclusion
functor
Lochyp
is
an
equivalence
serves
to
express,
int
→
Loc
in
a
rigorous
mathematical
fashion,
the
sentiment
that,
in
some
sort
of
“metric”
sense,
the
upper
half
plane
“almost
serves
as
a
core”
for
Lochyp
.
It
is
this
set
of
circumstances
that
led
the
author
to
the
introduction
of
the
notion
of
a
“quasicore”.
This
example
also
suggests
an
interesting
relationship
between
the
notions
of
uniformization
and
of
canonical
labels
for
elements
of
the
fundamental
group:
Namely,
the
Koebe
uniformization
theorem
for
hyperbolic
Riemann
surfaces
gives
rise
to
“canonical
labels”
(up
to
an
ambiguity
arising
from
some
sort
of
conjugation
action)
via
2
by
2
matrices
since
it
induces
an
embedding
of
the
topological
fundamental
group
of
the
Riemann
surface
into
P
SL2
(R).
This
leads
us
to
the
content
of
§3:
In
§3,
we
discuss
the
theory
of
§1,
§2,
in
the
case
of
hyperbolic
curves
over
p-adic
and
number
ﬁelds.
In
this
case,
our
main
result
—
Theorem
3.1.6
—
states
that:
If
a
non-proper
hyperbolic
curve
over
such
a
ﬁeld
is
a
“geometric
core”
(i.e.,
a
core
as
in
[Mzk3]),
then
its
associated
anabelioid
admits
a
faithful
quasi-core.

This
allows
us
to
assign
“canonical
names”
to
the
elements
of
its
arithmetic
fundamental
group
in
a
fashion
reminiscent
of
the
way
in
which
the
Koebe
uniformization
theorem
allows
one
to
assign
“canonical
names”
to
the
elements
of
the
topological
fundamental
group
of
a
hyperbolic
Riemann
surface.
This
main
result
is,
in
essence,
a
formal
consequence
of
Theorem
A
of
[Mzk6],
and
may
be
regarded
as
an
interpretation
of
the
main
result
of
[Mzk9],
§2,
via
the
geometry
of
anabelioids.

Let

a

Let
us
write

ZG

=
{g

|
g
·
h
=

·
g,
∀

g

g

}
for
the
commensurator
of
H
in
G.
Note
that:
(i)
ZG
(H),
NG
(H)
and
CG
(H)
are
subgroups
of
G;
(ii)
we
have
inclusions
H,
ZG
(H)
⊆
NG
(H)
⊆
CG
(H)
and
(iii)
H
is
normal
in
NG

Note
that
ZG
(H),
NG
(H)
are
always
closed
in
G,
while
CG
(H)
is
not
necessarily
closed
in
G.
Indeed,
one
may
construct
such
an
example
as
follows:
Let
def
M
=

Zp
N
endowed
with
the
product
topology
(of
the
various
copies
of
Zp
equipped
with
their
usual
topology).
Thus,
M
is
a
Hausdorﬀ
topological
group.
For
n
∈
N,
write
F
n
(M)
⊆
M
for
the
sub-topological
group
given
by
the
product
of
the
copies
of
Zp
indexed
by
m
≥
n.
Write
AutF
(M)
for
the
set
of
automorphisms
of
the
topological
group
M
that
preserve
the
ﬁltration
F
∗
(M)
on
M.
If
α
∈
AutF
(M),
then
for
every
n
∈
N,
α
induces
a
continuous
homomorphism
αn
:
M/F
n
(M)
→
M/F
n
(M)
which
is
clearly
surjective,
hence
an
isomorphism
(since
M/F
n
(M)
is
proﬁnite
and
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated
—
cf.
[FJ],
Proposition
15.3).
It
∼
thus
follows
that
α
induces
an
isomorphism
F
n
(M)
→
F
n
(M),
hence
that
the
inverse
of
α
also
lies
in
AutF
(M).
In
particular,
we
conclude
that
AutF
(M)
is
6
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI*
a
group.
Equip
AutF
(M)
with
the
coarsest
topology
for
which
all
of
the
homomorphisms
AutF
(M)
→
Aut(M/F
n
(M))
(where
Aut(M/F
n
(M))
∼
=
GLn
(Zp
)
is
equipped
with
its
usual
topology)
are
continuous.
Note
that
relative
to
this
topology,
AutF
(M)
forms
a
Hausdorﬀ
topological
group.
Now
deﬁne
G
to
be
the
semidirect
product
of
M
with
AutF
(M)
(so
G
is
a
Hausdorﬀ
topological
group),
and
H
to
be


pn
·
Zp
⊆
Zp
=
M
n∈N
N
(so
H
⊆
G
is
a
closed
subgroup).
Then
CG
(H)
is
not
closed
in
G.
For
instance,

if
one
denotes
by
en
∈
N
Zp
the
vector
with
a
1
in
the
n-th
place
and
zeroes
elsewhere,
then
the
limit
A∞
(where
def
A∞
(en
)
=
en
+
en+1

for
all
n
∈
N)
of
the
automorphisms
Am
∈
CG
(H)
(where
Am
(en
)
=
en
+
en+1
if
def
n
≤
m,
Am

=

if
n

is
not
contained
in
CG
(H).
Curves:
Suppose
that
g
≥
0
is
an
integer.
Then
a
family
of
curves
of
genus
g
X
→S
is
deﬁned
to
be
a
smooth,
proper,
geometrically
connected
morphism
X
→
S
whose
geometric
ﬁbers
are
curves
of
genus
g.
Suppose
that
g,
r
≥
0
are
integers
such
that
2g
−
2
+
r
>
0.
We
shall
denote
the
moduli
stack
of
r-pointed
stable
curves
of
genus
g
(where
we
assume
the
points
to
be
unordered)
by
Mg,r
(cf.
[DM],
[Knud]
for
an
exposition
of
the
theory
of
such
curves;
strictly
speaking,
[Knud]
treats
the
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
Mg,r
determined
by
ordering
the
marked
points).
The
open
substack
Mg,r
⊆
Mg,r
of
smooth
curves
will
be
referred
to
as
the
moduli
stack
of
smooth
r-pointed
stable
curves
of
genus
g
or,
alternatively,
as
the
moduli
stack
of
hyperbolic
curves
of
type
(g,
r).
A
family
of
hyperbolic
curves
of
type
(g,
r)
X
→S
is
deﬁned
to
be
a
morphism
which
factors
X
→
Y
→
S
as
the
composite
of
an
open
immersion
X
→
Y
onto
the
complement
Y
\D
of
a
relative
divisor
D
⊆
Y
which
is
ﬁnite
étale
over
S
of
relative
degree
r,
and
a
family
Y
→
S
of
curves
of
genus
g.
One
checks
easily
that,
if
S
is
normal,
then
the
pair
(Y,
D)
is
unique
up
to
canonical
isomorphism.
(Indeed,
when
S
is
the
spectrum
of
a
ﬁeld,
this
fact
is
well-known
from
the
elementary
theory
of
algebraic
curves.
Thus,
the
asserted
uniqueness
follows
formally
from
the
normality
of
S
and
the
fact
that
Mg,r
is
a
separated
algebraic
stack
(cf.
[DM],
[Knud]).)
We
shall
refer
to
Y
(respectively,
D;
D;
D)
as
the
compactiﬁcation

divisor
at
inﬁnity;
divisor

of

A
family
of

X

is
deﬁned
to
be
a
morphism
X
→
S
such
that
the
restriction
of
this
morphism
to
each
connected
component
of
S
is
a
family
of
hyperbolic
curves
of
type
(g,

for
some
integers
(g,

as
above.
Next,
we
would
like
to
consider
“orbicurves”.
We
shall
say
that
an
algebraic
stack
is
generically
scheme-like
if
it
admits
an
open
dense
algebraic
substack
which
is
isomorphic
to
a
scheme.
Let
X
be
a
smooth,
geometrically
connected,
generically
scheme-like
algebraic
stack
of
ﬁnite
type
over
a
ﬁeld
k
of
characteristic
zero.
Then
we
shall
say
that
X
is
an
orbicurve
if
it
is
of
dimension
1.
We
shall
say
that
X
is
a
hyperbolic
orbicurve
if
it
is
an
orbicurve
which
admits
a
compactiﬁcation
X
→
X
(necessarily
unique!)
by
a
proper
orbicurve
X
over
k
such
that
if
we
denote
the
reduced
divisor
X\X
by
D
⊆
X,
then
X
is
scheme-like
near
D,
and,
moreover,
the
line
bundle
ωX/k
(D)
on
X
has
positive
degree.
An
example
of
a
hyperbolic
orbicurve
over
k
is
given
by
the
quotient
—
in
the
sense
of
stacks
—
of
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
k
by
the
action
of
a
ﬁnite
group
which
acts
freely
on
all
but
a
ﬁnite
number
of
points
of
the
curve.
Now
suppose
that
X
is
a
hyperbolic
orbicurve
over
a
ﬁeld
k
(of
characteristic
zero),
with
compactiﬁcation
X
→
X.
Let
k
be
an
algebraic
closure
of
k.
Write
X
→X

for
the
“coarse
moduli
space”

Section
1:
Anabelioids
§1.1.
The
Notion
of
an
Anabelioid
We
begin
by
ﬁxing
a
(Grothendieck)
universe
V
,
in
the
sense
of
set-theory
(cf.,
e.g.,
[McLn1];
[McLr],
§12.1),
in
which
we
shall
work.
Also,
let
us
assume
that
we
are
given
a
V
-small
category
Ensf
of
ﬁnite
sets.
Let
G
be
a
(V
-small)
proﬁnite
group
—
that
is
to
say,
the
underlying
proﬁnite
set
of
G
is
an
inverse
limit
of
V
-sets
indexed
by
a
V
-set.
Then
to
G,
we
may
associate
the
(V
-small)
category
B(G)
of
(V
-small)
ﬁnite
sets
∈
Ob(Ensf
)
with
continuous
G-action.
This
category
is
a(n)
(elementary)
topos
(in
the
sense
of
topos
theory).
In
fact,
it
forms
a
rather
special
kind
of
topos
called
a
Galois
category
(cf.
[John1]
for
an
exposition
of
the
general
theory
of
topoi
and,
in
particular,
of
Galois
categories;
cf.
also
[SGA1],
Exposé
V).
Deﬁnition
1.1.1.
We
shall
refer
to
as
a
connected
anabelioid
any
category
X
which
is
equivalent
to
a
category
of
the
form
B(G)
for
some
proﬁnite
group
G.
Remark
1.1.1.1.
Thus,
a
“connected
anabelioid”
is
the
same
as
a
Galois
category
(as
deﬁned,
for
instance,
in
[John1],
p.
285)
—
i.e.,
a
“Boolean
topos”
that
admits
an
“exact,
isomorphism
reﬂecting
functor”
to
the
category
of
ﬁnite
sets.
Let
X
be
a
connected
anabelioid.
Then
recall
(cf.
[SGA1],
Exposé
V,
§5)
the
notion
of
a
fundamental
functor
β
∗
:
X
→
Ensf
—
i.e.,
an
exact
functor.
Here,
we
recall
that
an
exact
functor
is
a
functor
that
preserves
ﬁnite
limits
and
ﬁnite
colimits.
Note
that
(since
X
is
assumed
to
be
a
connected
anabelioid)
an
exact
functor
β
∗
:
X
→
Ensf
is
necessarily
isomorphism
reﬂecting
(i.e.,
a
morphism
α
of
X
is
an
isomorphism
if
and
only
if
β
∗
(α)
is).
def
Recall,
moreover,
that
if
X
=
B(G),
and
β
∗
:
B(G)
→
Ensf
is
the
functor
deﬁned
by
forgetting
the
G-action,
then
G
may
be
recovered,
up
to
inner
automorphism,
from
X
,
β
as
the
group:
Aut(β
∗
)
Also,
let
us
recall
that
any
two
fundamental
functors
are
isomorphic.
Note
that
Ensf
itself
is
a
connected
anabelioid
(i.e.,
the
result
of
applying
B(−)
to
the
trivial
group),
so
we
may
think
of
fundamental
functors
as
“basepoints”
in
the
following
way:

SHINICHI

Deﬁnition
1.1.2.
(i)
If
X
and
Y
are
connected
anabelioids,
then
we
deﬁne
a
morphism
φ
:
X
→
Y
to
be
an
exact
functor
φ∗
:
Y
→
X
(cf.
[SGA1],
Exposé
V,
Proposition
6.1).
An
isomorphism
between
connected
anabelioids
is
a
morphism
whose
corresponding
functor
in
the
opposite
direction
is
an
equivalence
of
categories.
(ii)
We
deﬁne
a
basepoint
of
a
connected
anabelioid
X
to
be
a
morphism
β
:
Ens
→
X
.
If
β
is
a
basepoint
of
X
,
then
we
refer
to
the
group
Aut(β)
as
the
fundamental
group
π1
(X
,
β)
of
(X
,
β).
f
Remark
1.1.2.1.
Thus,
the
“category
of
(V
-small)
connected
anabelioids”
is
a
2category
(cf.,
e.g.,
[John1],
§0.1;
[McLr],
Chapter
12;
[McLn2],
XII),
hence
requires
special
care,
for
instance,
when
considering
composites,
etc.
Also,
we
remark,
relative
to
the
standard
terminology
of
category
theory,
that
if
φ
:
X
→
Y
is
an
isomorphism
(of
connected
anabelioids),
it
will
not,
in
general,
be
the
case
that
φ∗
is
an
isomorphism
of
categories
(i.e.,
an
equivalence
for
which
the
correspondence
between
classes
of
objects
in
the
two
categories
is
a
bijection
—
cf.
[McLn2],
IV,
§4).
Remark
1.1.2.2.
Since
the
isomorphism
class
of
the
fundamental
group
π1
(X
,
β)
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
basepoint
β,
we
will
also
speak
of
the
“fundamental
group
π1
(X
)
of
X
”
when
the
choice
of
basepoint
is
irrelevant
to
the
issue
under
discussion.
Remark
1.1.2.3.
Note
that
a
functor
φ∗
:
Y
→
X
which
is
an
equivalence
is
always
necessarily
exact.
Thus,
an
isomorphism
of
anabelioids
φ
:
X
→
Y
is
simply
an
equivalence
φ∗
:
Y
→
X
in
the
opposite
direction.
Example
1.1.3.
Anabelioids
Associated
to
Schemes.
Let
X
be
a
(V
-small)
connected
locally
noetherian
scheme.
Then
we
shall
denote
by
Ét(X)
the
category
whose
objects
are
(V
-small)
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
X
and
whose
morphisms
are
morphisms
of
schemes
over
X.
Then
it
is
well-known
(cf.
[SGA1],
Exposé
V,
§7)
that
Ét(X)
is
a
connected
anabelioid.
If
G
is
a
proﬁnite
group,
then
we
shall
use
the
notation
Aut(G);
Inn(G);
def
Out(G)
=
Aut(G)/Inn(G)
to
denote
the
group
of
(continuous)
automorphisms
(respectively,
inner
automorphisms;
(continuous)
outer
automorphisms)
of
G.
If
H
is
another
proﬁnite
group,
THE
GEOMETRY
OF
ANABELIOIDS
11
then
we
shall
write
Hom(G,
H)
for
the
set
of
continuous
homomorphisms
G
→
H,
and
HomOut
(G,
H)
for
the
set
of
continuous
outer
homomorphisms
G
→
H,
i.e.,
the
quotient
of
Hom(G,
H)
by
the
natural
action
of
H
from
the
right.
Also,
we
shall
write
HomOut
(G,
H)
for
the
(V
-small)
category
whose
objects
are
the
elements
of
the
set
Hom(G,
H)
and
for
which
the
morphisms
MorHomOut
(ψ1
,
ψ2
)
from
an
object
ψ1
:
G
→
H
to
an
object
ψ2
:
G
→
H
are
the
elements
h
∈
H
such
that
ψ2
(g)
=
h
·
ψ1
(g)
·
h−1
,
∀g
∈
G.
Thus,
HomOut
(G,
H)
may
be
thought
of
as
the
set
of
isomorphism
classes
of
the
category
HomOut
(G,
H).
Proposition
1.1.4.
(The
“Grothendieck
Conjecture”
for
Connected
def
def
Anabelioids)
Let
X
=
B(G),
Y
=
B(H)
(where
G,
H
are
proﬁnite
groups),
and
β
:
Ensf
→
X
,
γ
:
Ensf
→
Y
be
the
tautological
basepoints
of
X
,
Y,
respectively,
determined
by
the
deﬁnition
of
the
notation
“B(−)”.
Then:
(i)
There
is
a
natural
equivalence
of
categories:
∼
HomOut
(G,
H)
→
Mor(X
,
Y)
which
induces
a
natural
bijection:
∼
HomOut
(G,
H)
→
Mor(X
,
Y)
Here,
Mor(X
,
Y)
(respectively,
Mor(X
,
Y))
denotes
the
category
(respectively,
set
of
isomorphism
classes)
of
morphisms
X
→
Y.
(ii)
There
is
a
natural
bijection:
∼
Hom(G,
H)
→
Mor{(X
,
β);
(Y,
γ)}
Here,
Mor{(X
,
β);
(Y,
γ)}
denotes
the
set
of
(isomorphism
classes
of)
morphisms
φ
:
X
→
Y
such
that
φ
◦
β
=
γ.
Proof.
Let
us
ﬁrst
consider
the
situation
of
(2).
Given
a
homomorphism
ψ
:
G
→
H,
composition
with
ψ
induces
a
continuous
action
of
G
on
any
ﬁnite
set
with
continuous
H-action.
Moreover,
this
operation
does
not
aﬀect
the
underlying
ﬁnite
set,
so
we
get
an
element
ψMor
∈
Mor{(X
,
β);
(Y,
γ)}.
This
deﬁnes
the
morphism
of
(2).
On
the
other
hand,
given
an
element
φ
∈
Mor{(X
,
β);
(Y,
γ)},
it
follows
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
φ
induces
a
morphism
Aut(β)
→
Aut(γ).
One
checks
easily
12
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI*
that
this
correspondence
deﬁnes
a
two-sided
inverse
(well-deﬁned
up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
of
Aut(γ)
∼
=
H)
to
the
correspondence
ψ
→
ψMor
.
Next,
we
consider
the
situation
of
(1).
By
the
above
paragraph,
we
get
a
morphism
Hom(G,
H)
→
Mor(X
,
Y)
Let
us
ﬁrst
verify
that
this
morphism
is
a
surjection.
Denote
by
S
the
pro-object
of
Y
whose
underlying
proﬁnite
set
Sset
=
H
and
whose
H-action
is
given
by
the
usual
action
on
Sset
=
H
from
the
left.
Note
that
the
group
of
automorphisms
AutY
(S)
of
S
(as
a
pro-object
of
Y)
may
be
identiﬁed
with
H
via
the
action
of
H
on
Sset
=
H
from
the
right.
In
fact,
this
action
of
H
on
S
(from
the
right)
endows
S
with
a
structure
of
“H-torsor
object”
of
Y.
Thus,
if
φ
:
X
→
Y
is
a
morphism,
def
then
T
=
φ∗
(S)
is
an
H-torsor
object
of
X
.
If
we
think
of
T
as
a
proﬁnite
set
Tset
equipped
with
a
G-action
from
the
left
and
an
H-action
from
the
right,
then
let
us
observe
that,
by
ﬁxing
some
element
t
∈
Tset
,
we
may
identify
the
group
of
automorphisms
AutH
(Tset
)
of
the
proﬁnite
set
Tset
that
commute
with
the
H-action
from
the
right
with
H
via
its
action
from
the
left.
Here,
we
observe
that
such
an
identiﬁcation
AutH
(Tset
)
∼
=H
is
determined
by
the
choice
of
a
“basepoint”
t
∈
Tset
,
hence
is
well-deﬁned,
up
to
composition
with
an
inner
automorphism
of
H.
It
thus
follows
that
the
action
of
G
on
Tset
from
the
left
determines
a
continuous
outer
homomorphism
G
→
AutH
(Tset
)
=
H
which
(cf.
the
preceding
paragraph)
gives
rise
to
a
morphism
X
→
Y
isomorphic
to
φ.
This
completes
our
veriﬁcation
of
surjectivity.
Thus,
to
complete
the
proof
of
(1),
it
suﬃces
to
verify
that
there
is
a
natural
bijection
between
the
set
of
isomorphisms
between
the
morphisms
φ1
,
φ2
:
X
→
Y
arising
from
two
continuous
homomorphisms
ψ1
,
ψ2
:
G
→
H
and
the
subset
MorHomOut
(ψ1
,
ψ2
)
⊆
H.
To
verify
this,
let
us
observe
that
if
we
pull-back
the
H-torsor
object
S
of
Y
(cf.
the
preceding
paragraph)
via
φ1
,
φ2
to
def
def
obtain
H-torsor
objects
T1
=
φ∗1
(S),
T2
=
φ∗2
(S)
of
X
,
then
it
is
a
tautology
that
∼
isomorphisms
φ1
→
φ2
are
in
natural
bijective
correspondence
with
isomorphisms
∼
T1
→
T2
of
H-torsor
objects
of
X
.
Thus,
the
desired
bijection
is
a
consequence
of
Lemma
1.1.5
below.
Lemma
1.1.5.
(Two-Sided
Group
Actions)

a

and
the

of

determined
by
composing
the

of

from

with

for

Remark
1.1.4.1.
Many
readers
may
feel
that
Proposition
1.1.4
is
“trivial”
and
“well-known”.
The
reason
that
we
nevertheless
chose
to
give
a
detailed
exposition
of
this
fact
here
is
that
it
represents
the
essential
spirit
that
we
wish
to
convey
in
the
term
“anabelioid”.
That
is
to
say,
we
wish
to
think
of
anabelioids
X
as
generalized

(which
is
natural
since
they
are,
after
all,
topoi
—

[John2])
whose
geometry
just
happens
to
be
“completely
determined
by
their
fundamental
groups”
(albeit
somewhat
tautologically!).
This
is
meant
to
recall
the
notion
of
an
anabelian
variety
(cf.
[Groth]),
i.e.,
a
variety
whose
geometry
is
determined
by
its
fundamental
group.
The
point
here
(which
will
become
clear
as
the
manuscript
progresses)
is
that:
The
introduction
of
anabelioids
allows
us
to
work
with
both
“algebrogeometric
anabelioids”
(i.e.,
anabelioids
arising
from
(anabelian)
varieties
—
cf.
Example
1.1.3)
and
“abstract
anabelioids”
(i.e.,
those
which
do
not
necessarily
arise
from
an
(anabelian)
variety)
as
geometric
objects
on
an
equal
footing.
The
reason
that
it
is
important
to
deal
with
“geometric
objects”
as
opposed
to
groups,
is
that:
We
wish
to
study
what
happens
as
one
varies
the
basepoint
of
one
of
these
geometric
objects.
That
is
to
say,
groups
are
determined
only
once
one
ﬁxes
a
basepoint.
Thus,
it
is
diﬃcult
to
describe
what
happens
when
one
varies
the
basepoint
solely
in
the
language
of
groups.
Next,
let
φ:X
→Y
be
a
morphism
between
connected
anabelioids.
Write
Iφ
⊆
X
14
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI*
for
the
smallest
subcategory
of
X
that
contains
all
subquotients
of
objects
in
the
essential
image
of
the
pull-back
functor
φ∗
.
One
veriﬁes
immediately
that
Iφ
is
a
connected
anabelioid.
Note
that
the
morphism
φ
:
X
→
Y
factors
naturally
as
a
composite
X
→
Iφ
→
Y
with
the
property
that
if
we
choose
a
basepoint
βX
of
X
and
denote
the
resulting
basepoints
of
Iφ
,
Y,
by
βIφ
,
βY
,
respectively,
then
the
induced
morphisms
of
fundamental
groups
π1
(X
,
βX
)

π1
(Iφ
,
βIφ
)
→
π1
(Y,
βY
)
are
a
surjection
followed
by
an
injection.
Moreover,
we
note
the
following
consequence
of
Proposition
1.1.4,
(i):
Corollary
1.1.6.
(Automorphism
of
an
Arrow
Between
Connected
Anabelioids)
The
set
of
automorphisms
Aut(X
→
Y)
of
a
1-arrow
X
→
Y
between
connected
anabelioids
is
in
natural
bijective
correspondence
with
the
centralizer
in
the
fundamental
group
of
Y
of
the
image
of
the
fundamental
group
of
X
.
Deﬁnition
1.1.7.
(i)
We
shall
refer
to
Iφ
as
the
image
of
X
in
Y.
(ii)
We
shall
refer
to
a
morphism
φ
:
X
→
Y
between
connected
anabelioids
as
a
π1
-epimorphism
(respectively,
π1
-monomorphism)
if
the
morphism
Iφ
→
Y
(respectively,
X
→
Iφ
)
is
an
equivalence.
Now
let
I
be
a
ﬁnite
set.
Assume
that
for
each
i
∈
I,
we
are
given
a
connected
anabelioid
Xi
.
Write

def
Xi
XI
=
i∈I
for
the
product
of
the
categories
Xi
.
In
the
terminology
of
[SGA1],
Exposé
V,
§9,
this
XI
is
a
“multi-Galois
category”.
In
particular,
XI
is
a
topos.
Deﬁnition
1.1.8.
Let
X
be
a
topos,
and
S
∈
Ob(X
)
an
object
of
X
.
Write
0X
(respectively,
1X
)
for
the
initial
(respectively,
terminal)
object
of
X
.
Then
any
collection
of
data

S∼
Sa
=
a∈A
(where
0X
∼

Sa
∈
Ob(X
);
the
index
set
A
is
ﬁnite)
will
be
called
a
decomposition
=
of
S.
The
object
S
will
be
called
connected
if
the
index
set
of
any
decomposition
of
S
has
cardinality
one.
The
topos
X
will
be
called
connected
if
1X
is
connected.
Next,
let
us
observe
that:
THE
GEOMETRY
OF
ANABELIOIDS
15
The
set
I
and
the
categories
Xi
(for
i
∈
I),
as
well
as
the
equivalence
of
categories
between
XI
with
the
product
of
the
Xi
may
be
recovered
entirely
from
the
abstract
category
XI
.
Indeed,
let
us
denote
(for
i
∈
I)
the
object
of
XI
obtained
by
taking
the
product
of
1Xi
with
the
0Xj
(for
j
=
i)
by
i
.
Thus,
we
obtain
a
decomposition
1XI
=

i
i∈I
of
the
object
1XI
.
Moreover,
this
decomposition
is
clearly
maximal
with
respect
to
the
partial
ordering
on
decompositions
of
1XI
determined
by
the
(obviously
deﬁned)
notion
of
reﬁnements
of
decompositions
of
1XI
.
Thus,
we
see
that
this
decomposition
may
be
recovered
solely
from
internal
structure
of
the
category
XI
.
In
particular,
the
ﬁnite
set
I
may
be
recovered
category-theoretically
from
the
category
XI
.
Moreover,
the
category
Xi
may
be
recovered
category-theoretically
from
the
category
XI
as
the
subcategory
of
objects
over
i
.
Finally,
it
is
clear
that
these
subcategories
determine
the
equivalence
of
categories
between
XI
with
the
product
of
the
Xi
.
Deﬁnition
1.1.9.
We
shall
refer
to
the
Xi
as
the
connected
components
of
XI
def
and
to
π0
(XI
)
=
I
as
the
(ﬁnite)
index
set
of
connected
components.
Deﬁnition
1.1.10.
(i)
We
shall
refer
to
a
category
equivalent
to
a
category
of
the
form
XI
as
an
anabelioid.
We
shall
denote
the
2-category
of
V
-small
anabelioids
by
AnabV
(or
simply
Anab,
when
there
is
no
danger
of
confusion).
(ii)
A
morphism
between
anabelioids
is
deﬁned
to
be
an
exact
functor
in
the
opposite
direction.
An
isomorphism
between
anabelioids
is
a
morphism
whose
corresponding
functor
in
the
opposite
direction
is
an
equivalence
of
categories.
Next,
let
us
observe
that
if
we
are
given
a
ﬁnite
set
J
,
together
with
connected
anabelioids
Yj
for
each
j
∈
J
,
and
morphisms
ζ
:
I
→
J;
φi
:
Xi
→
Yζ(j)
we
get
an
exact
functor
φ∗I
:
YJ
→
XI
(by
forming
the
product
of
the
φi
),
which
we
would
like
to
regard
as
a
morphism
φI
:
XI
→
YJ
.

between

on
the

and
the

of

ψ
:
XI

YJ
.
Proof.
Indeed,
this
follows
immediately
by
considering
the
pull-back
of
1YJ
,
as
well
as
of
its
maximal
decomposition,
via
the
exact
functor
ψ
∗
,
in
light
of
the
fact
(observed
above)
that

1XI
=
i
i∈I
is
the
maximal
(relative
to
reﬁnement)
decomposition
of
1XI
.
Deﬁnition
1.1.12.
We
shall
refer
to
a
morphism
between
anabelioids
as
a
π1
epimorphism
(respectively,
π1
-monomorphism)
if
each
of
the
component
morphisms
(cf.
Proposition
1.1.11)
between
connected
anabelioids
is
a
π1
-epimorphism
(respectively,
π1
-monomorphism).
§1.2.
Finite
Étale
Morphisms
In
this
§,
we
consider
the
notion
of
a
“ﬁnite
étale
morphism”
in
the
context
of
anabelioids.
Let
X
be
an
anabelioid.
Let
S
∈
Ob(X
).
We
will
denote
the
category
of
objects
over
S
by
XS
(i.e.,
the
objects
of
XS
are
arrows
T
→
S
in
X
;
the
arrows
of
XS
between
T
→
S
and
T

→
S
are
S-morphisms
T
→
T

).
Let
us
write
jS
:
XS
→
X
for
the
forgetful
functor
(i.e.,
the
functor
that
maps
T
→
S
to
T
)
and
i∗S
:
X
→
XS
for
the
functor
given
by
taking
the
product
with
S.
Proposition
1.2.1.
(The
Extension
Functor)
(i)
The
category
XS
is
an
anabelioid
whose
connected
components
are
in
natural
bijective
correspondence
with
the
connected
components
of
S.
(ii)
The
functor
jS
is
left
adjoint
to
the
functor
i∗S
.
(iii)
The
functor
i∗S
is
exact,
hence
deﬁnes
a
morphism
of
anabelioids
iS
:
XS
→
X
.
(iv)
Suppose
that
S
is
the
coproduct
of
a
ﬁnite
number
of
copies
of
1X
(indexed,
say,
by
a
(V
-)set
A).
Then
each
connected
component
of
XS
may
be
identiﬁed
with
THE
GEOMETRY
OF
ANABELIOIDS
17
X
;
the
set
of
connected
components
of
XS
may
be
identiﬁed
with
A.
Moreover,
jS
maps
a
collection
of
objects
{Sa}a∈A
of
X
indexed
by
A
to
the
coproduct
object

Sa
a∈A
in
X
.
(v)
Suppose
that
X
=
B(G)
(where
G
is
a
(V
-small)
proﬁnite
group)
and
that
S
is
given
by
the
G-set
G/H,
where
H
⊆
G
is
an
open
subgroup.
Then
iS
:
XS
→
X
may
be
identiﬁed
with
[i.e.,
is
“abstractly
equivalent”
(cf.
§0)
—
in
a
natural
fashion
—
to]
the
morphism
B(H)
→
B(G)
induced
by
the
inclusion
H
→
G.
Moreover,
if
T
∈
Ob(XS
)
is
represented
by
an
H-set
Tset
,
then
jS
(T
)
is
isomorphic
to
the
G-set
given
by
(G
×
Tset
)/H
where
H

h
acts
on
G
×
Tset

(g,
t)
via
(g,
t)
→
(hg,
ht),
and
the
G-action
is
the
action
induced
on
(G
×
Tset
)/H
by
letting
G

g
act
on
G
by
multiplication
by
g
−1
from
the
right.
Proof.
These
assertions
all
follow
immediately
from
the
deﬁnitions.
Thus,
Proposition
1.2.1,
(ii),
shows
that
if
φ
:
Y
→
X
factors
as
the
com∼
posite
of
an
isomorphism
α
:
Y
→
XS
with
the
morphism
iS
:
XS
→
X
for
some
S
∈
Ob(X
),
then
there
is
a
natural
choice
for
the
isomorphism
α,
namely,
the
isomorphism
induced
by
the
left
adjoint
φ!
:
Y
→
X
to
the
functor
φ∗
.
Indeed,
it
follows
from
Proposition
1.2.1,
(ii),
that
such
a
left
adjoint
φ!
always
exists
and
∼
def
that
φ!
induces
an
isomorphism
Y
→
XSφ
,
where
Sφ
=
φ!
(1Y
).
Deﬁnition
1.2.2.
(i)
A
morphism
of
anabelioids
φ
:
Y
→
X
will
be
called
ﬁnite
étale
if
it
factors
∼
as
the
composite
of
an
isomorphism
α
:
Y
→
XS
with
the
morphism
iS
:
XS
→
X
for
some
S
∈
Ob(X
).
(ii)
Suppose
that
φ
:
Y
→
X
is
a
ﬁnite
étale
morphism.
Then
we
shall
refer
to
the
left
adjoint
functor
φ!
to
the
pull-back
functor
φ∗
as
the
extension
functor
associated
to
φ.
Remark
1.2.2.1.
Thus,
the
morphism
B(H)
→
B(G)
induced
by
a
continuous
homomorphism
φ
:
H
→
G
is
ﬁnite
étale
if
and
only
if
φ
is
an
injection
onto
an
open
subgroup
of
G.
Moreover,
any
ﬁnite
étale
morphism
of
connected
anabelioids
18
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI*
may
be
written
in
this
form
(by
choosing
appropriate
basepoints
for
the
domain
and
range).
The
characterization
of
Deﬁnition
1.2.2,
(i),
however,
has
the
virtue
of
being
independent
of
choices
of
basepoints.
Deﬁnition
1.2.3.
Let
φ
:
Y
→
X
be
a
ﬁnite
étale
morphism
of
anabelioids.
Then
we
shall
say
that
φ
is
a
covering
(respectively,
relatively
connected)
if
the
induced
morphism
π0
(Y)
→
π0
(X
)
on
connected
components
(cf.
Deﬁnition
1.1.9)
is
surjective
(respectively,
an
bijective).
Deﬁnition
1.2.4.
(i)
Let
G
be
a
proﬁnite
group.
Then
we
shall
say
that
G
is
slim
if
the
centralizer
ZG
(H)
of
any
open
subgroup
H
⊆
G
in
G
is
trivial.
(ii)
Let
X
be
an
anabelioid.
Then
we
shall
say
that
X
is
slim
if
the
fundamental
group
π1
(Xi
)
of
every
connected
component
i
∈
π0
(X
)
of
X
is
slim.
(iii)
A
morphism
of
anabelioids
whose
corresponding
pull-back
functor
is
rigid
will
be
called
rigid.
A
2-category
of
anabelioids
will
be
called
slim
if
every
1morphism
in
the
2-category
is
rigid.
(iv)
If
C
is
a
2-category,
we
shall
write
|C|
for
the
associated
1-category
whose
objects
are
objects
of
C
and
whose
morphisms
are
isomorphism
classes
of
morphisms
of
C.
We
shall
also
refer
to
|C|
as
the
coarsiﬁcation
of
C.
Remark
1.2.4.1.
The
name
“coarsiﬁcation”
is
motivated
by
the
theory
of
“coarse
moduli
spaces”
associated
to
(say)
“ﬁne
moduli
stacks”.
Remark
1.2.4.2.
Thus,
a
diagram
of
rigid
morphisms
of
anabelioids
“1-commutes”
(cf.
§0)
if
and
only
if
it
commutes
in
the
coarsiﬁcation.
In
a
word,
the
theory
of
coverings
of
anabelioids
is
easiest
to
understand
when
the
anabelioid
in
question
is
slim.
For
instance:
Proposition
1.2.5.
(Slim
Anabelioids)
Let
X
be
a
slim
anabelioid.
Then:
(i)
The
pull-back
and
extension
functors
associated
to
a
ﬁnite
étale
morphism
between
slim
anabelioids
are
rigid
(cf.
§0).
In
particular,
if
we
write
Et(X
)
⊆
Anab
THE
GEOMETRY
OF
ANABELIOIDS
19
for
the
2-category
whose
(0-)objects
are
ﬁnite
étale
morphisms
Y
→
X
and
whose
(1-)morphisms
are
ﬁnite
étale
arrows
Y1
→
Y2
“over”
X
[i.e.,
in
the
sense
of
def
“1-commutativity”
—
cf.
§0],
then
Et(X
)
is
slim.
Write:
Ét(X
)
=
|Et(X
)|.
(ii)
The
functor
FX
:
X
→
Ét(X
)
S
→
(XS
→
X
)
(where
S
∈
Ob(X
))
is
an
equivalence
(i.e.,
fully
faithful
and
essentially
surjective).
Proof.
Indeed,
(i)
follows
formally
from
Corollary
1.1.6
and
Deﬁnition
1.2.4,
(i),
(ii),
(iii).
As
for
(ii),
essential
surjectivity
follows
formally
from
Deﬁnition
1.2.2,
(i).
To
prove
fully
faithfulness,
it
suﬃces
to
compute,
when
X
=
B(G),
Y1
=
B(H1
),
Y2
=
B(H2
),
and
H1
,
H2
are
open
subgroups
of
G,
the
subset
MorX
(Y1
,
Y2
)
⊆
Mor(Y1
,
Y2
)
[i.e.,
of
isomorphism
classes
of
morphisms
“over”
X
]
via
Proposition
1.1.4,
(i).
This
computation
yields
that
the
set
in
question
is
equal
to
the
quotient,
via
the
conjugation
action
by
H2
,
of
the
set
of
morphisms
H1
→
H2
induced
by
conjugation
by
an
element
g
∈
G
such
that
H1
⊆
g
·H2
·g
−1
.
But
this
quotient
may
be
identiﬁed
with
the
subset
of
elements
g
·
H2
∈
G/H2
such
that
H1
⊆
g
·
H2
·
g
−1
.
Note
that
here
we
must
apply
the
assumption
of
slimness,
to
conclude
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
quotient
G/H2
any
further
by
various
centralizers
in
G
of
conjugates
of
H1
.
On
the
other
hand,
this
quotient
is
simply
another
description
of
the
set
HomG
(G/H1
,
G/H2
)
as
desired.
Remark
1.2.5.1.
By
Proposition
1.2.5,
(i),
it
follows
that,
at
least
when
we
restrict
our
attention
to
ﬁnite
étale
morphisms
of
slim
anabelioids,
we
do
not
“lose
any
essential
information”
by
working
in
the
coarsiﬁcation
(of
Anab).
Thus,
in
the
following
discussion,
we
shall
often
do
this,
since
this
simpliﬁes
things
substantially.
For
instance,
if
φ
:
Y
→
X
and
ψ
:
Z
→

By
thinking
of
φ
:
Y
→
X
as
some
“XS
→
X
”
as
in
the
above
discussion,
one
veriﬁes
easily
that
this
deﬁnition
satisﬁes
all
the
expected
properties.
One
veriﬁes
easily
that
all
conceivable
compatibilities
are
satisﬁed
[e.g.,
when
one
interchanges
the
roles
of
φ
and
ψ].
Remark
1.2.5.2.
In
fact,
essentially
all
of
the
anabelioids
that
we
shall
actually
deal
with
in
this
paper
will
be
slim.
Thus,
in
some
sense,
it
might
have
been
more
natural
to
take
the
notion
of
a
“slim
anabelioid”
as
our
deﬁnition
of
the
term
“anabelioid”.
There
are
two
reasons
why
we
chose
not
to
do
this:
First,
this
would
require
us
to
prove
slimness
every
time
that
we
wish
to
use
term
“anabelioid”,
which
would,
in
some
sense,
be
rather
unnatural,
just
as
having
to
prove
separatedness
every
time
one
uses
the
term
“scheme”
(if,
as
in
the
earlier
terminology,
one
deﬁnes
a
scheme
to
be
a
“separated
scheme”
(in
the
current
terminology)).
Second,
just
as
with
the
separatedness
of
schemes,
which
is
not
a
Zariski
local
notion,
the
notion
of
slimness
of
an
anabelioid
is
not
(ﬁnite)
étale
local.
(That
is
to
say,
a
nonslim
anabelioid
may
admit
a
ﬁnite
étale
covering
which
is
slim.)
Thus,
requiring
anabelioids
to
be
slim
would
mean
that
the
notion
of
an
anabelioid
is
not
“ﬁnite
étale
local”,
which
would
again
be
unnatural.
Remark
1.2.5.3.
Note
that
although
FX
is
fully
faithful
and
essentially
surjective,
substantial
care
should
be
exercised
when
speaking
of
FX
as
an
“equivalence”.
The
reason
for
this
is
that:
The
collection
of
objects
of
Ét(X
)
or
Et(X
)
necessarily
belongs
to
a
larger
Grothendieck
universe
—
that
is
to
say,
unlike
X
,
the
category
Ét(X
)
is
no
longer
V
-small
—
than
the
collection
of
objects
of
X
.
Put
another
way,
FX
,
i.e.,
the
passage
from
X
to
Ét(X
),
may
be
thought
of
as
a
sort
of
“change
of
Grothendieck
universe,
while
keeping
the
internal
category
structure
intact”.
Just
as
in
the
theory
of
schemes,
one
often
wishes
to
work
not
just
with
ﬁnite
étale
coverings,
but
also
with
“proﬁnite
étale
coverings”
(i.e.,
projective
systems
of
étale
coverings).
In
the
case
of
anabelioids,
we
make
the
following
Deﬁnition
1.2.6.
We
shall
refer
to
as
a
pro-anabelioid
any
“pro-object”
(indexed
by
a
set)
X
=←
lim
−
Xα

relative
to
the
coarsiﬁed

Anab

in
which
all
of
the
transition
morphisms
Xα
→
Xβ
are
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
slim
anabelioids.
Here,
by
“pro-object”,
we
mean
an
equivalence
class
of
projective
systems
(relative
to
the
evident
notion
of
equivalence).

Remark
1.2.6.1.
Thus,
(for
us)
pro-anabelioids
only
exist
at
the
“coarsiﬁed
level”
(unlike
anabelioids,
which
may
be
treated
either
in
Anab
or
in
Anab).
Remark
1.2.6.2.
Given
a
pro-anabelioid
X

In
general,
π0
(X

will
be
a
proﬁnite
set.
Moreover,
for
each
i
∈

one
obtains
a
connected
pro-anabelioid
Xi
by
forming
lim
←−

of
the
compatible

of

of

Note
that
this

also
applies
in
the

when

both

by
thinking
of
anabelioids
as
pro-anabelioids
indexed

the
set
with

def
Suppose
that
we
are
given
a
connected
anabelioid
X
=
B(G)
(where
G
is
a
proﬁnite
group).
Let
us
write
β
:
Ensf
→
X
for
the
tautological
basepoint
of
B(G).
Then
one
important
example
of
a
pro-anabelioid
which
forms
a
proﬁnite
étale
covering
of
X
is
the
“universal
covering”
Xβ
,
deﬁned
as
follows:
For
each
def
open
subgroup
H
⊆
G,
let
us
write
XH
=
B(H).
(In
other
words,
XH
is
the
category
XS
associated
to
the
object
S
∈
Ob(X
)
determined
by
the
G-set
G/H.)
Thus,
if
H

⊆
H,
then
we
have
a
natural
morphism
XH

→
XH
.
Moreover,
these
morphisms
form
a
projective
system
whose
transition
morphisms
are
clearly
ﬁnite
étale
coverings.
Hence,
we
obtain
a
pro-anabelioid
def
Xβ

over

Y

splits
(i.e.,

Deﬁnition
1.2.7.
Let
X
be
an
anabelioid,
and
Y
a
pro-anabelioid.
Then
a
proﬁnite
étale
covering
Y

X
will
be
referred
to
as
a
universal
covering
of
X
if
it
is
relatively
connected
[i.e.,
given
by
a
projective
system
of
relatively
connected
ﬁnite
étale
morphisms]
and
satisﬁes
the
property
that
the
pull-back
to
Y
of
any
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
X
splits.
Note
that
by
Proposition
1.2.5,

it
follows
that
when
X
=
B(G)
is
slim,
the
set
MorX
(Xβ
,
XH
)
may
be
identiﬁed
with
G/H.
In
particular,
we
obtain
the
result
that
the
basepoint
β
is
naturally
equivalent
to
the
restriction
to
the
image
of
the

FX

of

Then
the
formula

(where

deﬁnes
an

Proof.
Assertions
(i),
(ii)
follow
formally
from
the
deﬁnitions
and
the
above
discussion.
Now
let
us
consider
assertion
(iv).
Suppose
that
we
are
given
an
isomorphism
∼
φ
:
X
→
X

.
By
Proposition
1.1.4,
(i),
such
a
morphism
arises
from
some
homomorphism
H
→
H

,
determined
up
to
conjugation
with
an
inner
automorphism
arising
from
H

.
Here,
we
take
H
⊆
G,
H

⊆
G
to
be
normal
open
subgroups.
If
K

⊆
G
is
another
normal
open
subgroup
contained
in
H

,
then
there
exists
a
normal
open
subgroup
K
⊆
G
contained
in
H,
together
with
a
homomorphism
K
→
K

(determined
by
φ,
up
to
conjugation
with
an
inner
automorphism
arising
from
K

)
such
that
the
outer
homomorphism
H
→
H

is
compatible
with
the
outer
homomorphism
K
→
K

.
Note,
moreover,
that
since
X

is
slim,
a
unique
homomorphism
H
→
H

up
to
conjugation
with
an
inner
automorphism
arising
from
K

is
determined
by
the
homomorphism
K
→
K

.
(Indeed,
this
follows
by
considering
the
faithful
actions
(by
conjugation)
of
H,
H

on
K,
K

,
respectively.)
Thus,
by
taking
K

to
be
arbitrarily
small,
we
see
that
φ
determines
a
unique
homomorphism
H
→
H

⊆
G
.
Consideration
of
the
inverse
to
φ
shows
that
this
homomorphism
H
→
G
is
necessarily
an
open
injection.
On
the
other
hand,
any
open
injection
H
→
G
clearly
determines
an
isomorphism
φ.
This
completes
the
proof
of
(iv).
Finally,
we
consider
property
(iii).
Since
it
is
clear
that
any
isomorphism
between
universal
coverings
induces
an
isomorphism
of
the
corresponding
basepoints,
it
suﬃces
to
prove
property
(iii)
in
the
“automorphism”
case.
For
simplicity,
we
shall
write
X
=
B(G),
and
assume
that
the
basepoint
β
in
question
is
the
tautolog∼
ical
basepoint.
By
property
(iv),
any
isomorphism
φ
:
X
→
X
arises
from
an
open
injection
H
→
G.
The
fact
that
the
composite
of
φ
with
X
→
X
is
isomorphic
to
X
→
X
implies
(cf.
Proposition
1.1.4,
(i))
that
this
open
injection
H
→
G
is
induced
by
conjugation
by
a
unique
(by
slimness)
element
of
G.
On
the
other
hand,
conjugation
by
an
element
of
G
clearly
determines
an
element
of
AutX
(X
).
Thus,
AutX
(X
)
=
G,
as
desired.

1.2.8.1.
When
(cf.
Proposition
1.2.8,
(iv))
β,

are
ﬁxed
throughout
the

we

Finally,
before
proceeding,
we
present
the
following:

(i)
We
shall
say
that
a

relatively
slim
if
the
centralizer
in
H

is
trivial.
(ii)
We
shall
say
that
a
morphism
of
anabelioids
U

V
is
relatively
slim
if
the
induced
morphism
between
fundamental
groups
of
corresponding
connected
components
of
U,
V
is
relatively
slim.
Remark
1.2.9.1.
Thus,
X
is
slim
if
and
only
if
the
identity
morphism
X
→
X
is
relatively
slim.
Also,
if
U
→
V
is
relatively
slim,
then
the
arrow
U
→
V
is
rigid
[i.e.,
has
no
nontrivial
automorphisms
—
cf.
Corollary
1.1.6].
If
U
→
V
is
a
relatively
slim
morphism
between
connected
anabelioids,
then
it
follows
that
V
is
slim;
if,
moreover,
U

is
a
π1

then
it
follows
that
U
is
also
slim.

if
X
is
a
terminal
object
in
Loc(X
).
(ii)
We
shall
say
that
X
admits
a(n)
(absolute)
core
if
there
exists
a
terminal
object
Z
in
Loc(X
).
In
this
case,
Loc(X
)
=
Loc(Z)
=
Loc(Z),
so
we
shall
say
that
Z
is
a
core.
Remark
2.1.2.1.
Note
that
in
Proposition
2.1.1,
(ii),
it
is
important
to
assume
that
the
quotients
Z
that
one
considers
are
slim.
Indeed,
if
one
did
not
impose
this
condition,
then
by
“forming
quotients
of
slim
anabelioids
by
the
trivial
actions
of
ﬁnite
groups”,
one
veriﬁes
easily
that
the
1-category
associated
to
the
resulting
2-category
never
admits
a
terminal
object
—
i.e.,
“no
slim
anabelioid
would
admit
a
core”.
From
the
point
of
view
of
anabelian
varieties
—
e.g.,
hyperbolic
orbicurves
—
this
condition
of
slimness
amounts
to
the
condition
that
the
algebraic
stacks
that
one
works
with
are
generically
schemes
(cf.
[Mzk9],
§2).
Remark
2.1.2.2.
Note
that
the
deﬁnability
of
Loc(X
),
Loc(X
)
is
one
of
the
most
fundamental
diﬀerences
between
the
theory
of
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
anabelioids
as
discussed
in
§1.2
and
the
theory
of
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
from
the
point
of
view
of
“Galois
categories”,
as
given
in
[SGA1].
Indeed,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
theory
of
[SGA1],
it
is
only
possible
to
consider
“Ét(X
)”
—
i.e.,
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
and
morphisms
that
always
lie
over
X
.
That
is
to
say,
in
the
context
of
the
theory
of
[SGA1],
it
is
not
possible
to
consider
diagrams
such
as:
Z


X
Y
(where
the
arrows
are
ﬁnite
étale)
that
do
not
necessarily
lie
over
any
speciﬁc
geometric
object.
We
shall
refer
to
such
a
diagram
as
a
correspondence
or
isogeny
between
X
and
Y.
When
there
exists
an
isogeny
between
X
and
Y,
we
shall
say
that
X
and
Y
are
isogenous.
Next,
we
would
like
to
consider
universal
coverings.
Let
β,
γ
be
basepoints
of
a
connected
slim
anabelioid
X
.
Write
πβ
:
Xβ
→
X
;
πγ
:
Xγ
→
X
for
the
associated
universal
coverings
(cf.
the
discussion
of
§1.2).
In
the
following
discussion,
we
would
also
like
to
consider
an
isomorphism
∼
ξ
:
Xβ
→
Xγ
(cf.
Proposition
1.2.8,
(iv)).
THE
GEOMETRY
OF
ANABELIOIDS
27
∼
Deﬁnition
2.1.3.
We
shall
refer
to
an
isomorphism
ξ
:
Xβ
→
Xγ
as
above
as
an
outer
path
from
β
to
γ.
If
ξ
arises
from
a
commutative
[i.e.,
at
the
coarsiﬁed
level]
diagram
of
anabelioids
ξ
Xβ
−→
Xγ
⏐
⏐

⏐


X
id
X
−→
X
then
we
shall
refer
to
ξ
as
an
inner
path
from
β
to
γ.
An
outer
(respectively,
inner)
path
from
β
to
itself
will
be
referred
to
as
an
(Xβ
-valued)
open
(respectively,
closed)
path.
Remark
2.1.3.1.
Thus,
inner
paths
are
precisely
the
paths
of
[SGA1],
Exposé
V,
§7.
Note
that
the
diﬀerence
between
an
“inner”
path
and
an
“outer”
path
depends
essentially
on
the
“identity”
of
β,
γ
—
i.e.,
what
appears
to
be
an
outer
path
if
one
thinks
of
β
and
γ
as
in
fact
being
“equal”
may
appear
to
be
an
inner
path
if
one
thinks
of
β
and
γ
as
“distinct”.
Put
another
way:
The
distinction
between
inner
and
outer
paths
depends
essentially
on
the
“model
of
set
theory”
under
consideration
—
i.e.,
on
the
labels
that
one
uses
to
describe
the
various
sets
involved
in
the
discussion.
It
is
the
hope
of
the
author
to
pursue
this
point
of
view
in
more
detail
in
a
future
paper.
Remark
2.1.3.2.
Note
that
an
inner
path
is
a
special
case
of
an
outer
path.
The
diﬀerence
between
an
inner
path
and
an
arbitrary
outer
path
is
easiest
to
analyze
when
β
=
γ
(but
cf.
Remark
2.1.3.1!).
In
this
case,
an
(Xβ
-valued)
closed
path
is
simply
an
element
of
the
fundamental
group
π1
(X
,
β).
On
the
other
hand,
the
motivation
for
the
terminology
“open
path”
is
the
following.
Let
K
be
a
perfect
ﬁeld;
L
a
ﬁnite
Galois
extension
of
K;
and
K
an
algebraic
closure
of
K.
Then
to
give
a
K-valued
basepoint
β
of
L
is
to
give
an
∼
embedding
ιβ
:
L
→
K.
If
we
are
then
given
a
K-linear
isomorphism
σ
:
K
→
K
(i.e.,
an
element
σ
∈
Gal(K/K)),
then
the
composite
of
σ
with
ιβ
determines
another
embedding
ιγ
:
L
→
K.
Of
course,
the
two
basepoints
β,
γ
of
Spec(L)
deﬁned
by
ιβ
,
ιγ
map
to
the
same
basepoint
of
Spec(K)
—
i.e.,
“if
one
applies
the
projection
Spec(L)
→
Spec(K),
then
σ
becomes
a
closed
path
in
Spec(K)”.
This
is
intended
to
be
reminiscent
of
the
analogy
between
Galois
groups
in
ﬁeld
theory
and
fundamental
groups
in
algebraic
topology
(where
we
recall
that
the
theory
of
the
latter
may
be
formulated
not
just
in
terms
of
covering
groups,
but
also
in
terms
of
literal
closed
paths,
i.e.,
topological
images
of
the
circle
S1
,
in
the
space
in
question).
Thus,
it
is
natural
to
regard
σ
—
when
working
with
σ
as
an
object
associated
to
Spec(L)
—
as
an
open
path
(valued
in
K),
i.e.,
the
analogue
of
a
topological
image
of
the
interval
[0,
2π]
as
opposed
to
the
circle
S1,
on
Spec(L).

Incidentally,
this
example
also
shows
the
reason
for
the
choice
of
terminology
“inner/outer
path”.
That
is
to
say,
inner/closed
paths
induce
(via
“parallel
transport”)
inner
automorphisms
of
the
fundamental
group,
while
outer/open
paths
arise
from
arbitrary
(outer)
automorphisms,
or
even
isogenies,
of
the
fundamental
group.
Proposition
2.1.4.
(The
Totality
of
Basepoints)
Let
X
be
a
connected
slim
anabelioid.
Let
X
→
X
be
a
universal
covering
of
X
,
that
determines
some
basepoint
β
of
X
.
Then:
(i)
The
subgroup
def
ΠX
=
π1
(X
,
β)
=
AutX
(X
)
⊆
Aut(X
)
=
Isog(X
)
is
commensurable
with
all
of
its
conjugates
in
Isog(X
).
Moreover,
the
open
subgroups
of
ΠX
deﬁne
a
basis
for
a
topology
on
Isog(X
)
with
respect
to
which
Isog(X
)
forms
a
Hausdorﬀ
topological
group.
Finally,
the
subgroup
ΠX
⊆
Isog(X
)
is
both
open
and
closed
with
respect
to
this
topology.
(ii)
Isog(X
)
acts
transitively
on
the
set
of
X
-valued
basepoints
—
i.e.,
(isomorphism
classes
of)
proﬁnite
étale
morphisms
X
→
X
—
of
X
.
Moreover,
this
action
determines
a
bijection
between
the
set
of
X
-valued
basepoints
and
the
coset
space:
Isog(X
)/ΠX
(iii)
Suppose
that
X
is
a
core.
Then
ΠX
=
Isog(X
).
That
is
to
say,
X
admits
precisely
one
X
-valued
basepoint.
In
particular,
all
open
paths
on
X
are,
in
fact,
closed.
Moreover,
the
natural
functors
Et(X
)
→
Loc(X
)
→
Loc(X
);
Ét(X
)
→
Loc(X
)
→
Loc(X
)
are
equivalences.
Proof.
These
assertions
are
all
formal
consequences
of
the
deﬁnitions
(cf.
also
Proposition
1.2.8,
(iv)).
Remark
2.1.4.1.
Note,
however,
that
the
subgroup
of
Isog(X
)
generated
by
ΠX
and
some
conjugate
of
ΠX
does
not
necessarily
contain
either
of
these
two
groups
as
a
ﬁnite
index
subgroup.
Perhaps
the
most
famous
example
of
this
phenomenon
is
the
theorem
of
Ihara
(cf.,
e.g.,
[Serre1],
II,
§1.4,
Corollary
1;
[Ihara])
expressing
SL2
(Qp
)
as
an
amalgam
of
two
copies
of
SL2
(Zp
),
amalgamated
along
a
subgroup
which
is
open
in
both
copies
of
SL2
(Zp
).
In
the
notation
of
the
present
discussion,
this
example
corresponds
to
the
case
X
=
B(SL±
2
(Zp
))
def
THE
GEOMETRY
OF
ANABELIOIDS
29
(where,
instead
of
SL2
(Zp
),
we
use
its
quotient
SL±
2
(Zp
)
by
±1
to
ensure
that
X
is
slim).
Note
that
this
example
shows
that
Isog(X
)
does
not
necessarily
admit
a
natural
structure
of
proﬁnite
group.
Indeed,
in
the
case
of
SL±
2
(Zp
),
one
checks
easily
(by
applying
the
theory
of
p-adic
Lie
groups
—
cf.,
e.g.,
[Serre2],
Chapter
V,
§7)
that
Isog(X
)
=
P
GL2
(Qp
)
(which
is
not
proﬁnite).
Remark
2.1.4.2.
The
above
example
of
SL2
(Zp
)
highlights
one
of
the
major
themes
of
the
present
paper,
i.e.,
that:
open
paths
⇐⇒
Isog(X
)
⇐⇒
correspondences
—
that
is
to
say,
just
as
(in
the
“classical
theory”
of
the
étale
fundamental
group
given
in
[SGA1])
closed
paths
(i.e.,
elements
of
π1
)
correspond
to
elements
of
ΠX
,
open
paths
corresponds
to
elements
of
Isog(X
),
i.e.,
“correspondences”.
Remark
2.1.4.3.
It
is
interesting
to
note
relative
to
Proposition
2.1.4,
(ii)
(cf.
also
Proposition
1.2.8,
(iii);
Remark
2.1.3.1)
that
the
cardinality
of
the
collection
of
basepoints
Ensf
→
X
is
the
same
as
that
of
the
collection
of
proﬁnite
étale
morphisms
X
→
X
.
Indeed,
both
collections
have
the
same
cardinality
as
the
collection
of
morphisms
Ensf
→
Ensf
.
§2.2.
Holomorphic
Structures
and
Commensurable
Terminality
In
this
§,
we
wish
to
discuss
a
relative
version
of
the
theory
of
§2.1.
Let
X
,
Q
be
slim
anabelioids.
Deﬁnition
2.2.1.
(i)
A
Q-holomorphic
structure
on
X
is
the
datum
of
a
relatively
slim
morphism
(cf.
Deﬁnition
1.2.9,
(ii))
X
→
Q,
which
we
shall
refer
to
as
the
structure
morphism.
(ii)
A
slim
anabelioid
equipped
with
a
Q-holomorphic
structure
will
be
referred
to
as
a
Q-anabelioid.
(iii)
A
Q-holomorphic
morphism
(or
“Q-morphism”
for
short)
between
Qanabelioids
is
a
morphism
of
anabelioids
compatible
with
the
Q-holomorphic
structures.
(iv)
A
Q-holomorphic
structure/Q-anabelioid
will
be
called
faithful
if
its
structure
morphism
is
a
π1
-monomorphism.
Remark
2.2.1.1.
Here,
we
note
that
the
term
“compatible”
in
Deﬁnition
2.2.1,
(iii),
makes
sense,
precisely
because
of
the
assumption
of
relative
slimness
in
Deﬁnition
2.2.1,
(i)
(cf.
Corollary
1.1.6).

SHINICHI

Let
us
write
LocQ
(X
)
for
the
2-category
whose
(0-)objects
Y
→
Q
are
Q-anabelioids
that
admit
a
Qholomorphic
ﬁnite
étale
morphism
Y
→
X
to
X
,
and
whose
(1-)morphisms
are
arbitrary
ﬁnite
étale
Q-morphisms
(that
do
not
necessarily
lie
over
X
!).
Now
we
have
the
“Q-holomorphic
analogue”
of
Proposition
2.1.1:
Proposition
2.2.2.
(Categories
of
Holomorphic
Localizations)
Let
Q
be
a
slim,
connected
anabelioid;
X
a
Q-anabelioid.
Then:
def
(i)
LocQ
(X
)
is
slim.
Write:
LocQ
(X
)
=
|LocQ
(X
)|.
(ii)
Denote
by
LocQ
(X)
the
2-category
whose
(0-)objects
Z
→
Q
are
Q-anabelioids
which
arise
as
ﬁnite
étale
quotients
of
objects
in
LocQ
(X
)
[i.e.,
there
exists
a
ﬁnite
étale
Q-morphism
Y
→
Z,
where
Y
∈
Ob(LocQ
(X
))]
and
whose
(1-)morphisms
are
ﬁnite
étale
Qdef
morphisms.
Then
the
2-category
LocQ
(X
)
is
slim.
Write:
LocQ
(X
)
=
|LocQ
(X
)|.
(iii)
The
2-category
LocQ
(X
)
(respectively,
category
LocQ
(X
))
may
be
reconstructed
entirely
category-theoretically
from
LocQ
(X
)
(respectively,
LocQ
(X
))
by
considering
the
“2-category
(respectively,
category)
of
objects
of
LocQ
(X
)
(respectively,
LocQ
(X
))
equipped
with
a
ﬁnite
étale
equivalence
relation”.
(iv)
Suppose
that
we
arbitrarily
choose
ﬁnite
étale
structure
morphisms
to
X
for
all
of
the
objects
of
LocQ
(X
).
Then
every
morphism
Y1
→
Y2
of
LocQ
(X
)
∼
may
be
written
as
the
composite
of
an
isomorphism
Y1
→
Y3
(over
Q)
with
a
ﬁnite
étale
morphism
Y3
→
Y2
over
X
.
Let
X
be
a
Q-anabelioid.
Then:
Deﬁnition
2.2.3.
(i)
We
shall
say
that
X
is
a
Q-core
if
X
[i.e.,
X
→
Q]
is
a
terminal
object
in
LocQ
(X
).
(ii)
We
shall
say
that
X
admits
a
Q-core
if
there
exists
a
terminal
object
Z
in
LocQ
(X
).
In
this
case,
LocQ
(X
)
=
LocQ
(Z)
=
LocQ
(Z),
so
we
shall
say
that
Z
is
a
Q-core.
Deﬁnition
2.2.4.
(i)
We
shall
say
that
a
closed
subgroup
H
⊆
G
of
a
proﬁnite
group
G
is
commensurably
(respectively,
normally)
terminal
if
the
commensurator
CG
(H)
(respectively,
normalizer
NG
(H))
is
equal
to
H.

(ii)
We
shall
say
that
a

of

is

if
the
image
of
the
induced
morphism
between
fundamental
groups
of
corresponding
connected
components
of
U,
V
is
commensurably
(respectively,

terminal.
Remark
2.2.4.1.
Thus,
it
is
a
formal
consequence
of
the
deﬁnitions
that:
commensurably
terminal
=⇒
normally
terminal
and
that
commensurably
terminal
with
slim
domain
=⇒
relatively
slim
(where
the
“domain”
is
the
group
H
(respectively,
anabelioid
U)
in
Deﬁnition
2.2.4,
(i)
(respectively,
(ii))).
Proposition
2.2.5.
(Commensurable
Terminality
and
Holomorphic
Cores)
Let
X
be
a
connected
faithful
Q-anabelioid;
assume
that
Q
is
also
connected.
Then
X
is
a
Q-core
if
and
only
if
its
structure
morphism
is
commensurably
terminal.
Proof.
Without
loss
of
generality,
we
may
write
X
=
B(H),
Q
=
B(G),
where
H
⊆
G
is
a
closed
subgroup.
First,
we
verify
suﬃciency.
By
Proposition
1.1.4,
it
suﬃces
to
prove
that,
if
H

⊆
H
is
an
open
subgroup,
then
any
continuous
homomorphism
φ
:
H

→
G
whose
image
lies
in
H
and
which
factors
as
the
composite
of
the
natural
inclusion
H

→
G
with
conjugation
by
an
element
g
∈
G
is,
in
fact,
equal
to
the
to
composite
of
the
natural
inclusion
H

→
G
with
conjugation
by
an
element
h
∈
H.
But
this
follows
immediately
from
Deﬁnition
2.2.4,
(i),
which
implies
that
g
∈
H.
Finally,
necessity
follows
by
reversing
the
preceding
argument
in
the
evident
fashion.
Let
X
be
a
connected
Q-anabelioid.
For
simplicity,
we
also
assume
that
Q
is
connected.
Suppose
that
we
are
given
a
universal
covering
Q
→
Q
of
Q
and
consider
the
resulting
cartesian
diagram:

On

even
if

Put
another

SHINICHI

way,
in
general,
X
admits
distinct
X
-valued
Q-holomorphic
basepoints.
That
is
to
say,
we
have
the
Q-holomorphic
analogue
of
Proposition
2.1.4:
Proposition
2.2.6.
(The
Totality
of
Q-Holomorphic
Basepoints)
Let
X
be
a
connected
faithful
Q-anabelioid,
where
Q
is
also
connected.
Let
Q
→
Q
be
a
universal
covering
of
Q;
X
→
X
a
connected
component
of
Q|X
→
X
.
Write
def
def
ΠQ
=
AutQ
(Q),
ΠX
=
AutX
(X
).
Thus,
we
have
a
natural
inclusion
ΠX
⊆
ΠQ
.
Then:
(i)
The
subgroup
def
ΠX
=
AutX
(X
)
⊆
IsogQ
(X
)
=
AutQ
(X
)
=
CΠQ
(ΠX
)
is
commensurable
with
all
of
its
conjugates
in
IsogQ
(X
).
Moreover,
the
open
subgroups
of
ΠX
deﬁne
a
basis
for
a
topology
on
IsogQ
(X
)
with
respect
to
which
IsogQ
(X
)
forms
a
Hausdorﬀ
topological
group.
Finally,
the
subgroup
ΠX
⊆
IsogQ
(X
)
(respectively,
IsogQ
(X
)
⊆
Isog(X
))
is
both
open
and
closed
(respectively,
open)
with
respect
to
this
topology.
(ii)
IsogQ
(X
)
acts
transitively
on
the
set
of
X
-valued
Q-holomorphic
basepoints
—
i.e.,
(isomorphism
classes
of)
proﬁnite
étale
Q-morphisms
X
→
X
—
of
X
.
Moreover,
this
action
determines
a
bijection
between
the
set
of
X
-valued
Q-holomorphic
basepoints
and
the
coset
space:
IsogQ
(X
)/ΠX
(iii)
Suppose
that
X
is
a
Q-core.
Then
ΠX
=
IsogQ
(X
).
That
is
to
say,
X
admits
precisely
one
X
-valued
Q-holomorphic
basepoint.
In
particular,
all
“Qholomorphic”
open
paths
on
X
are,
in
fact,
closed.
Moreover,
the
natural
functors
Et(X
)
→
LocQ
(X
)
→
LocQ
(X
);
Ét(X
)
→
LocQ
(X
)
→
LocQ
(X
)
are
equivalences.
Remark
2.2.6.1.
Thus,
at
a
more
intuitive
level,
just
as
“(absolute)
cores
have
essentially
only
one
basepoint”,
if
X
is
a
Q-core,
then
every
basepoint
of
Q
determines
an
essentially
unique
(up
to
renaming)
Q-holomorphic
basepoint
of
X
.
Remark
2.2.6.2.
The
topology
of
Proposition
2.2.6,
(i),
is
not
to
be
confused
with
the
topology
on
CΠQ
(ΠX
)
induced
by
the
topology
of
ΠQ
.
For
instance,
if
ΠX
is
the
proﬁnite
free
group
on
2
generators
(which
is
easily
seen
to
be
slim
—
cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk8],
Lemma
1.3.1)
and
ΠQ
=
Aut(ΠX
)
(which
also
has
a
natural
structure
of
proﬁnite
group),
then
ΠQ
=
CΠQ
(ΠX
),
but
ΠX
is
not
open
[i.e.,
relative
to
the
proﬁnite
topology
of
ΠQ
]
in
ΠQ
.
Here,
we
note
that
Out(ΠX
)
=
Aut(ΠX
)/ΠX
,
hence
also
ΠQ
,
is
inﬁnite
and
slim.
[Indeed,
the
slimness
of
ΠQ
may
be
shown,
for
THE
GEOMETRY
OF
ANABELIOIDS
33
instance,
as
follows:
By
[Tama],
Theorem
0.4,
applied
to
the
projective
line
minus
three
points
over
the
ﬁeld
of
rational
numbers,
it
follows
that
the
centralizer
of
any
open
subgroup
of
Out(ΠX
)
is
contained
in
the
subgroup
of
Out(ΠX
)
obtained
by
considering
the
permutation
group
of
the
three
points.
On
the
other
hand,
by
∼
projecting
to
Out(Πab
X
)
=
GL2
(Z),
one
sees
that
any
element
of
this
permutation
group
that
centralizes
an
open
subgroup
of
GL2
(Z)
must
be
trivial.]
§2.3.
Quasi-Cores
and
Intrinsic
Exhaustivity
In
order
to
deﬁne
the
fundamental
group
of
a
(connected
slim)
anabelioid
X
,
it
is
necessary
to
choose
a
basepoint
for
X
.
As
we
saw
in
Proposition
1.2.8,
this
is
equivalent
to
choosing
a
universal
cover
X
→
X
of
X
.
On
the
other
hand,
in
general,
there
is
nothing
special
that
distinguishes
a
given
proﬁnite
étale
X
→
X
from
another
X
→
X
obtained
from
the
ﬁrst
by
composition
with
some
element
of
Aut(X
)
=
Isog(X
).
That
is
to
say,
the
diﬀerence
between
these
two
X
→
X
is
a
“matter
of
arbitrary
choices
of
labels”.
Thus,
the
question
naturally
arises:
To
what
extent
is
it
possible
to
construct
the
fundamental
group
of
a
(connected
slim)
anabelioid
in
a
canonical
fashion
that
does
not
depend
on
such
arbitrary
choices?
In
this
§
and
the
next,
we
would
like
to
analyze
this
issue
in
more
detail.
Our
main
result
(cf.
Theorem
2.4.3
below)
states
that
when
the
anabelioid
in
question
admits
a
“faithful
quasi-core”
(cf.
Deﬁnition
2.3.1),
then
its
fundamental
group
can
indeed
be
constructed
in
a
rather
canonical
fashion.
In
addition
to
quasi-cores,
we
also
consider
the
notion
of
intrinsic
exhaustivity,
which
provides
a
convenient,
intrinsic
necessary
condition
for
an
anabelioid
to
admit
a
faithful
quasi-core.
In
the
following,
we
shall
always
consider
morphisms
between
anabelioids
in
the
coarsiﬁcation
Anab
of
Anab.
Deﬁnition
2.3.1.
Let
X
be
a
Q-anabelioid
(so
X
,
Q
are
slim).
For
simplicity,
we
also
assume
that
the
fundamental
group
of
every
irreducible
component
of
Q
is
countably
(topologically)
generated.
(i)
We
shall
say
that
X
admits
(Q
as)
a
quasi-core
if
the
natural
functor
LocQ
(X
)
→
Loc(X
)
(given
by
forgetting
the
Q-holomorphic
structure)
is
an
equivalence.
(ii)
We
shall
say
that
X
admits
(Q
as)
a
faithful
quasi-core
if
X
admits
Q
as
a
quasi-core,
and,
moreover,
the
Q-structure
on
X
is
faithful.
Next,
let
us
recall
that
if
G
is
a
slim
proﬁnite
group,
then
it
admits
a
natural
injection
def
G
→
Isog(G)
=
Isog(B(G))
34
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI*
(cf.
Propositions
1.2.8,
(iv);
2.1.4,
(i)).
Thus,
in
the
following
discussion,
we
shall
regard
G
as
a
subgroup
of
Isog(G).
Deﬁnition
2.3.2.
We
shall
refer
to
as
a
proﬁnite
subgroup
K
⊆
Isog(G)
a
subgroup
K
of
the
abstract
group
Isog(G)
which
is
equipped
with
a
structure
of
proﬁnite
group
such
that
the
intersection
K
G
is
a
closed
subgroup
of
both
G
and
K
whose
induced
topologies
from
G
and
K
coincide.
Remark
2.3.2.1.
If
K
⊆
Isog(G)
is
a
proﬁnite
subgroup
which
is,
moreover,
commensurable
to
a
closed
subgroup
F
⊆
G
(i.e.,
K
F
is
open
in
F
,
K),
then
one
veriﬁes
easily
that
the
topology
on
K
is
the
unique
topology
with
respect
to
which
K
⊆
Isog(G)
is
a
proﬁnite
subgroup.
Remark
2.3.2.2.
One
veriﬁes
immediately
that
if
G
⊆
Isog(G)
is
a
proﬁnite
subgroup
commensurable
to
G
—
so
that
one
has
a
natural
identiﬁcation
Isog(G)
=
Isog(G
)
—
then
the
proﬁnite
subgroups
of
Isog(G)
are
the
same
(relative
to
this
identiﬁcation)
as
the
proﬁnite
subgroups
of
Isog(G
).
We
will
also
make
use
of
the
following
deﬁnitions:
Deﬁnition

(i)
A
proﬁnite
group
G

if

we
have:
[G

=
[G

such
that

Gn
=

n
and,
moreover,
for
any
proﬁnite
subgroup
K
⊆
Isog(G)
commensurable
to
G,
there
exists
an
integer
nK
—
depending
only
on
the
proﬁnite
subgroup
K
—
such
that
Gn
⊆
K
for
n

,
and,
for
any
open
subgroup
H
⊆
Gn
(where
n
≥
nK
)
and
any
open
embedding
ι
:
H
→
K,
we
have
ι(H)
⊆
Gn
(⊆

(ii)
An
anabelioid
will
be
called
intrinsically
exhaustive
(respectively,
weakly
intrinsically
exhaustive)
if
the
fundamental
group
of
every
connected
component
of

(respectively,

If

Suppose
that
(for
some
large
n)
Gn
(as
in
Deﬁnition
2.3.3)
is
contained
in
H,
so
ι(Gn
)
⊆
Gn
.
Then:

[H

Thus,
[G

On

if
we
apply
this
inequality
to
ι−1

then
we
obtain
the
reverse

This
implies
equality,
as

Next,
we
turn
to
assertion
(vii).
Suppose
that
X

is
a
quasi-core
for
X

Without
loss
of
generality,
we
may
assume
that
X
=
B(G),
Q
=
B(A),
and
that

is
induced
by
a
continuous
homomorphism
G

which
factors:

B
⊆
A
is
an
open
normal
subgroup
of

and
HA

B,
H

B,
then
for
any
open
embedding
ι
:
H
→

it
follows
from
Deﬁnition
2.3.1,
(i),
that
the
image
of
the
composite
of
ι
with
the
homomorphism
G
→
A
is
equal
to
a
·
HA
·
a−1
(for
some
element

Thus,
since
B
is

in
A,
we
conclude
that
a

HA

a−1
⊆
GA
B
=
HA
(for
some

On
the

this
implies
that
ι
factors
through
H,
hence
—
by
assertion
(vi)
—
that
ι(H)
=
H,
as
desired.
Finally,
we
turn
to
assertion
(viii).
Suppose
that

Without

that

that

Proof.
These

are
all
formal
consequences
of
the
deﬁnitions.
Remark
2.3.6.1.
Relative
to
Proposition
2.3.6,
(ii),
we
note
that
Aut(Gn
)
is
also
equal
to
the
normalizer
of
Gn
in
Isog(G).
When
G
(hence
also
the
Gn
)
is
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated,
then
it
follows
that
G
admits
an
exhaustive
descending
sequence
of
characteristic
open
subgroups
.
.
.
⊆
Hm
⊆
.
.
.
⊆
G,
hence
that
Aut(G)
(hence
also
the
Gn
)
admits
a
natural
structure
of
proﬁnite
group
(by
considering
the
inverse
limit
of
the
images
of
Aut(G)
in
the
various
Aut(G/Hm
)).
On
the
other
hand,
this
proﬁnite
topology
on
Aut(Gn
)
does
not,
in
general,
coincide
with
the
topology
induced
by
the
topology
of
Isog(G)
discussed
in
Proposition
2.1.4,
(i)
—
cf.
Remark
2.2.6.2.
Moreover,
(relative
to
Proposition
2.3.6,
(ii))
the
work
of
[TSH]
—
involving
inductive
limits
of
topological
groups
whose
inductive
limit
topology
(in
the
category
of
topology
spaces)
is
not
necessarily
compatible
with
the
group
structure
of
the
inductive
limit
—
shows
that
the
topology
of
inductive
limits
of
topological
groups
can,
in
general,
be
a
rather
subtle
issue.

Non-Intrinsically

Groups.
Let
p
be
a

number.
(i)
Take

Let
A
act
on
B
in
the
usual
fashion.
Take

Note
that

Then
the

def
H

(p
·
B)

A
⊆
G
is
clearly
isomorphic
to
G,
hence
violates
Proposition
2.3.5,
(vi).
Thus,
G
fails
to
be
weakly
intrinsically
exhaustive.
def
(ii)
Let
G
=
P
GL2
(Zp
).
Note
that
G
is
slim.
For
m
a
positive
integer,
write
Cm
⊆
G
for
the
subgroup
determined
by
the
matrices
congruent
to
the
identity
matrix
modulo
pm
.
Then
G
fails
to
be
intrinsically
exhaustive.
Indeed,
if
{Gn
}
is
as
in
Deﬁnition
2.3.3,
then
there
exist
positive
integers
m
≥
n
≥
nG
such
that:
Cm
⊆
Gn
⊆
C1
Thus,
for
all
open
embeddings
ι
:
Cm
→
G,
we
should
have:
ι(Cm
)
⊆
C1.
But
this
inclusion
fails
to
hold
if
we
take
ι
to
be
the
embedding
given
by
conjugation
by
pm
0
.
On
the
other
hand,
(it
is
an
easy
exercise
to
show
that)
in
the
matrix
0
1
this
case,
the
unimodularity
of
the
action
by
conjugation
of
GL2
(Qp
)
on
M2
(Qp
)
implies
that
G
is
weakly
intrinsically
exhaustive.
def
(iii)
For
n
≥
2,
let
G
=
Fn
,
the
free
proﬁnite
group
on
n
generators.
Then
G
is
slim
(cf.,
e.g.,
[Naka],
Corollary
1.3.4;
[Mzk8],
Lemma
1.3.1).
Moreover,
since,
THE
GEOMETRY
OF

39
for
any
n,
m
≥
2,
Fn
,
Fm
admit
isomorphic
open
subgroups,
in
order
to
prove
that
G
is
not
intrinsically
exhaustive
for
all
n,
it
suﬃces
to
prove
that
G
fails
to
be
intrinsically
exhaustive
for
some
n
(cf.
Proposition
2.3.5,
(iv)).
On
the
other
hand,
there
exists
an
n
such
that
G
is
isomorphic
to
an
open
subgroup
of
the
proﬁnite
completion
SL2(Z)∧
of
SL2(Z).
Thus,
one
may
show
that
to
assume
the
intrinsic
exhaustivity
of
any
open
subgroup
of
such
a
G
leads
to
a
contradiction
by
conjugating
by
“Hecke
operator-type
matrices”
—
an
operation
which
preserves
the
quotient
SL2(Z)∧

SL2
(Zp
)
—
as
in
(ii),
above.
Note,
however,
that
in
this
case,
the
Nielsen-Schreier
formula
(cf.,
e.g.,
[FJ],
Proposition
15.25)
implies
that
G
is
weakly
intrinsically
exhaustive.
(iv)
The
anabelioid
Ét(A1Fp
)
(notation
as
in
Example
1.1.3)
associated
to
the
aﬃne
line
over
Fp
fails
to
be
weakly
intrinsically
exhaustive.
Indeed,
the
existence
of
the
ﬁnite
étale
morphism
A1Fp
→
A1Fp
deﬁned
by
T
→
Tp
+
T
(where
T
is
the
standard
coordinate
on
A1Fp
)
contradicts
Proposition
2.3.5,
(vi).
(v)
If
K
is
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
,
then
the
associated
anabelioid
Ét(K)
is
weakly
intrinsically
exhaustive
(cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk5],
Proposition
1.2),
but
fails
to
be
intrinsically
exhaustive,
at
least
when
p
>
2.
Indeed,
to
see
that
GK
(the
absolute
Galois
group
of
K)
fails
to
be
intrinsically
exhaustive,
let
us
ﬁrst
recall
the
following
theorem
of
[JR]:
Let
K1
,
K2
be
ﬁnite
extensions
of
Qp
(where
p
>
2)
which
contain
the
∼
roots
of
unity
of
order
p.
Then
GK1
→
GK2
if
and
only
if
[K1
:
Qp
]
=
[K2
:
Qp
]
and
K1
(Qp
ab
)
=
K2
(Qp
ab
)
(where
Qp
ab
is
the
maximal
abelian
extension
of
Qp).
Now
suppose
that
{Gn
}
is
a
sequence
of
open
normal
subgroups
of
GK
as
in
Definition
2.3.3,
(ii).
Without
loss
of
generality
(cf.
Proposition
2.3.5,
(iv)),
we
may
assume
that
K
contains
the
roots
of
unity
of
order
p,
and
that
[K
:
Qp
]
≥
3.
Let
L
be
the
ﬁnite
Galois
extension
of
K
corresponding
to
some
Gn
.
Write
M
⊆
L
for
the
maximal
tamely
ramiﬁed
subextension
of
L
over
K.
By
taking
n
to
be
sufﬁciently
large,
we
may
assume
that
the
extension
L
of
M
is
not
cyclotomic,
i.e.,
that
L
=
L
(M
·
Qp
ab
).
Since
[M
:
Qp
]
≥
[K
:
Qp]
≥
3,
it
thus
follows
from
local
class
ﬁeld
theory
(cf.,
e.g.,
[Serre3])
that
the
wild
inertia
subgroup
of
Gab
M
has
rank
≥
3
over
Zp
,
hence
that
there
exists
a
wildly
ramiﬁed
abelian
extension
L
of
M
such
that:


[L
:
M]
=
[L
:
M];
L
=
L;
L
(M
·
Qp
ab
)
(M
·
Qp
ab
)
=
L
∼
Thus,
(by
the
theorem
of
[JR]
quoted
above)
we
conclude
that
GL
→
GL
=
Gn
despite
the
fact
that
GL
=
GL
.
But
this
contradicts
Deﬁnition
2.3.3,
(ii).

Canonical
Construction
of
the
Fundamental
Group
Let
X
be
a
slim,
connected
anabelioid.
In
this
§,
we
would
like
to
examine
the
extent
to
which
the
fundamental
group
of
X
may
be
constructed
in
a
canonical
fashion,
independent
of
a
choice
of
basepoint.
We
begin
by
introducing
some
notation.
Let
us
write
Locbp
(X
)
for
the
category
each
of
whose
objects
is
an
arrow
U
→
Y,
where
Y
is
a
connected
object
of
Loc(X
),
and
U
→
Y
is
a
universal
covering
of
Y
(cf.
Deﬁnition
1.2.7),
and
whose
morphisms
from
an
arrow
U1
→
Y1
to
an
arrow
U2
→
Y2
are
pairs
of
∼
arrows
αU
:
U1
→
U2
,
αY
:
Y1
→
Y2
such
that
the
diagram
α
U2
⏐
⏐

αY
Y2
U1
⏐
⏐

U
−→
Y1
−→
commutes;
αU
is
an
isomorphism;
and
αY
is
ﬁnite
étale.
Thus,
in
particular,
by
mapping
U
→
Y
to
Y,
we
obtain
a
functor
ΦX
:
Locbp
(X
)
→
Loc(X
)0
—
where
the
superscript
“0”
is
to
denote
the
full
subcategory
consisting
of
connected
objects
—
which
(by
deﬁnition)
is
surjective
on
objects.
On
the
other
hand,
if
we
deﬁne
SGp
to
be
the
category
whose
objects
are
pairs
(G,
H),
where
G
is
a
group,
and
H
is
a
subgroup
of
G,
and
whose
morphisms
from
(G1
,
H1
)
to
(G2
,
H2
)
are
homomorphisms
φ
:
G1
→
G2
such
that
φ(H1
)
⊆
H2
,
then
we
obtain
a
natural
functor
ΨX
:
Locbp
(X
)
→
SGp
by
mapping
an
arrow
U
→
Y
to
the
pair
(Aut(U),
AutY
(U)
⊆
Aut(U))
∼
and
a
morphism
from
U1
→
Y1
to
U2
→
Y2
to
the
isomorphism
Aut(U1
)
→
Aut(U2
).
Thus:
Locbp
(X
)
may
be
thought
of
as
the
“category
of
objects
of
Loc(X
)
equipped
with
a
basepoint”
and
ΨX
may
be
thought
of
as
the
standard
construction
of
the
fundamental
group
(in
the
presence
of
a
basepoint).
THE

41
When
it
is
necessary
to
specify
the
universe
V
relative
to
which
we
are
working
—
i.e.,
relative
to
which
we
take
all
of
our
(pro-)anabelioids
(respectively,
groups)
to
be
V
-small
(respectively,
V
-sets)
—
we
shall
write
LocVbp
(X
),
LocV
(X
)
(respectively,
SGpV
).
[Similarly,
we
shall
write
ΦVX
,
ΨVX
.]
Thus,
we
observe,
in
particular,
that
the
categories
LocVbp
(X
),
LocV
(X
)
are
not
V
-small.
Proposition
2.4.1.
(Dependence
of
the
Fundamental
Group
on
the
Choice
of
Universal
Covering)
Let
V
be
a
universe
[which
is,
therefore,
in
particular,
a
“set”
in
some
ambient
model
of
set
theory].
Let
X
be
a
V
-small
slim,
connected
anabelioid
such
that
the
subgroup
ΠX
⊆
Isog(X
)
(cf.
Proposition
2.1.4,
(i))
is
not
normal.
Then
there
exist
distinct
objects
of
LocVbp
(X
)
that
map
via
ΦVX
to
the
same
object
of
LocV
(X
)0
,
but
via
ΨVX
to
distinct
objects
of
SGpV
.
In
particular,
the
functor
ΨVX
does
not
factor
through
ΦVX
.
Proof.
Indeed,
let
π
:
X
→
X
be
a
universal
covering;
let
α
∈
Aut(X
)
be
an
def
def
element
that
does
not
normalize
ΠX
=
AutX
(X
).
Then
π

=
π
◦
α−1
is
also
a
universal
covering
of
X
.
Moreover,
we
have
ΨVX
(π)
=
(Aut(X
),
ΠX
)
=
ΨVX
(π
)
=
(Aut(X
),
α
·
ΠX
·
α−1
)
but
ΦVX
(π)
=
ΦVX
(π
)
=
X
.
Remark
2.4.1.1.
Thus,
the
proof
of
Proposition
2.4.1
suggests,
in
particular,
that,
in
order
to
obtain
a
factorization
of
ΨVX
through
ΦVX
—
i.e.,
to
obtain
a
“canonical
construction”
of
the
fundamental
group
that
does
not
depend
on
the
choice
of
basepoint
—
it
is
necessary
to
modify
ΨVX
so
that
it
takes
values
in
some
sort
of
“quotient”
in
which
subgroups
of
Aut(X
)
are
identiﬁed
with
their
conjugates.
This
motivates
the
following
discussion.
Let
V
,
X
be
as
in
Proposition
2.4.1.
Then
let
us
denote
by
SGpVX
the
category
each
of
whose
objects
is
an
assignment
A
U
→
AU
—
where
U
ranges
over
all
V
-small
universal
coverings
of
X
[i.e.,
all
domains
of
arrows
in
Locbp
(X
)],
and
AU
is
a
collection
of
subgroups
of
Aut(U)
—
such
that
∼
∼
for
every
isomorphism
U1
→
U2
,
the
induced
isomorphism
Aut(U1
)
→
Aut(U2
)
maps
AU1
onto
AU2
;
and
whose
morphisms
Hom(A,
A
)
are
deﬁned
as
follows:
The
cardinality
of
Hom(A,
A
)
is
always
≤
1;
we
take
the
cardinality
of
Hom(A,
A
)
to
be
1
if
and
only
if
the
following
condition
is
satisﬁed:
for
every
U,
every
H
∈
AU
,
there
exists
an
H

∈
AU
such
that
H
⊆
H

.
Note
that
this
category
SGpVX
is
not
V
-small.

Thus,
we
obtain
a
natural
functor
ΞVX
:
LocVbp
(X
)
→
SGpVX
by
mapping
an
arrow
U
→
Y
to
the
assignment
that
maps
a
universal
covering
V
to
the
conjugacy
class
of
subgroups
of
Aut(V)
determined
by
the
subgroup
AutY
(U)
⊆
∼
Aut(U)
and
an
isomorphism
Aut(U)
→
Aut(V)
which
is
induced
by
an
isomorphism
∼
U
→
V.
[Note
that
this
conjugacy
class
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
isomorphism
∼
U
→
V.]
Moreover,
it
is
evident
from
the
deﬁnition
of
ΞVX
that:
Theorem
2.4.2.
(Canonical
Fundamental
Groups
up
to
Isogeny)
Let
V
,
X
be
as
in
Proposition
2.4.1.
Then
there
exists
a
functor
ΞVX
:
LocV
(X
)0
→
SGpVX
such
that
ΞVX
=
ΞVX
◦
ΦVX
.
Remark
2.4.2.1.
Thus,
the
functor
of
Theorem
2.4.2
yields
a
functorial
[i.e.,
with
respect
to
ﬁnite
étale
coverings]
construction
of
the
fundamental
group
as
a
group
of
transformations
of
some
geometric
object
[i.e.,
the
universal
covering],
albeit
up
to
a
certain
indeterminacy,
given
by
the
action
of
Isog(X
).
On
the
other
hand,
this
functor
has
the
drawback
that
it
only
constructs
the
fundamental
group
as
an
“abstract
group”,
i.e.,
not
as
a
proﬁnite
group,
as
one
might
ideally
wish.
Now
let
us
assume
that
X
is
a
connected
Q-anabelioid.
For
simplicity,
we
assume
that
Q
is
also
connected.
In
the
following
discussion,
we
would
like
to
show
that
(certain
quotients)
of
the
fundamental
group
of
X
may
be
constructed
in
a
very
canonical
fashion
complete
with
their
proﬁnite
structure,
under
the
assumption
that
X
→
Q
is
a
quasi-core
for
X
.
First,
let
us
choose
an
explicit

For

up

the

of
a

That
is
to

there
is
a

Moreover,
the
uniqueness
of

implies
that

is
a

Thus,
in
summary,
we
see
that
we
obtain
an
outer

Gal(Qn

n
which
is

In

restricting

⊆
Aut(Xn

we
obtain
an
outer
homomorphism
ρGal
:
Gal(Xn

which
is

(as

hence,
in

by
the
isomorphism
class
of
X
plus
the
covering
Qn

Q
(since
X
→
Q
is
a
quasi-core).
Since
the
above
construction
is
clearly
“functorial
in
n”,
by
passing
to
the
limit
over
n,
we
thus
obtain
an
outer

whose

Let
us
denote
this
image
(well-deﬁned
up

by:
ΠX
/Q
⊆
ΠQ
Moreover,
since
the
above
construction
is
determined
entirely
by
the

of

,
it
follows
(cf.
Proposition
2.1.1,

that
the

functorial
with

If
G

44

for
the
category
whose
objects
are
conjugacy
classes
of
closed
subgroups
H
⊆
G,
and
whose
morphisms
H
→
H

are
inclusions
of
H
into
a
(conjugate
of)
H

.
That
is
to
say,
the
cardinality
of
the
set
of
morphisms
between
two
objects
of
Sub(G)
is
either
0
or
1.
Then
the
above
discussion
may
be
summarized
as
follows:
Theorem
2.4.3.
(Canonically
Constructed
Fundamental
Groups
via
Quasi-Cores)
Let
Q
be
a
slim,
connected
anabelioid.
Suppose
that
X
is
a
connected
Q-anabelioid
for
which
X
→
Q
is
a
quasi-core.
Then
there
is
a
functor
Loc(X
)0
→
Sub(ΠQ
)
Y
→
{ΠY/Q
⊆
ΠQ
}
such
that
B(ΠY/Q
)
is
isomorphic
to
the
image
of
Y
in
Q
(cf.
Deﬁnition
1.1.7).
In
particular,
if
X
→
Q
is
a
faithful
quasi-core,
then
Y
∼
=
B(ΠY/Q
).
Remark
2.4.3.1.
Thus,
Theorem
2.4.3
yields
a
canonical
construction
of
the
fundamental
group
of
a
slim,
connected
X
which
admits
a
faithful
quasi-core
Q.
Moreover,
this
construction
has
the
virtue
that
it
is
compatible
[cf.
the
above
discussion!]
with
the
proﬁnite
structure
of
the
fundamental
group
of
X
.
That
is
to
say,
more
concretely:
The
functor
of
Theorem
2.4.3
may
be
written
as
an
inverse
limit
of
a
compatible
system
of
functors
to
the
categories
Sub(ΠQ
/Hn
)
where
.
.
.
⊆
Hn
⊆
.
.
.
⊆
ΠQ
is
an
exhaustive
descending
sequence
of
open
normal
subgroups
of
ΠQ
.
This
compatibility
with
the
proﬁnite
structure
is
closely
related
to
the
the
intrinsicity
of
“knowing
how
local
one
is”
(cf.
Remark
2.3.5.1).
On
the
other
hand,
one
drawback
of
the
construction
of
Theorem
2.4.3
is
that
it
depends
on
the
arbitrary
choice
of
a
universal
covering
Q∞
→
Q
for
Q
as
an
“input
datum”.
This
motivates
the
following
deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition
2.4.4.
Let
X
be
a
slim,
connected
anabelioid.
Then
we
shall
refer
to
a
closed
subgroup
Δ
⊆
ΠX
,
considered
as
a
subgroup
of
Isog(X
),
as
an
intrinsic
proﬁnite
subgroup
if
it
is
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated,
normal
in
Isog(X
),
and,
moreover,
the
continuous
inclusion
of
Hausdorﬀ
topological
groups
Δ
→
Isog(X
)
is
relatively
slim.
Remark
2.4.4.1.
Note
that
since
Δ
is
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated,
it
follows
(cf.
Remark
2.3.6.1)
that
Aut(Δ)
has
a
natural
structure
of
proﬁnite
group.
THE
GEOMETRY

45
Proposition
2.4.5.
(The
Faithful
Quasi-Core
Associated
to
an
Intrinsic
Proﬁnite
Subgroup)
Let
Δ
⊆
Isog(X
)
be
an
intrinsic
proﬁnite
subgroup.
Then
the
action
by
conjugation
of
ΠX
on
Δ
yields
a
morphism
X
∼
=
B(ΠX
)
→
B(Aut(Δ))
which
is
a
faithful
quasi-core
for
X
.
Proof.
Indeed,
this
is
a
formal
consequence
of
Proposition
2.3.6,
(iii),
(a)
⇐⇒
(c).
Remark
2.4.5.1.
Thus,
when
the
quasi-core
of
Theorem
2.4.3
is
obtained
as
in
Proposition
2.4.5,
one
can
replace
the
functor
of
Theorem
2.4.3
by
a
functor
in
the
style
of
Proposition
2.4.2:
That
is
to
say,
instead
of
considering
a
conjugacy
class
of
subgroups
of
a
particular
proﬁnite
group
ΠQ
,
we
observe
that
for
any
universal
covering
U,
we
obtain
a
natural
proﬁnite
subgroup
ΔU
⊆
Aut(U)
∼
(determined
by
conjugating
Δ
by
some
isomorphism
U
→
X
of
U
to
the
universal
∼
covering
X
used
to
deﬁne
Isog(X
))
such
that
any
isomorphism
U1
→
U2
maps
ΔU1
to
ΔU2
.
In
particular,
we
obtain
an
assignment
def
U
→
AU
=
Aut(ΔU
)
∼
which
is
functorial
in
isomorphisms
U1
→
U2
.
Then
instead
of
obtaining
a
conjugacy
class
of
subgroups
[as
in
Theorem
2.4.3]
in
a
particular
ΠQ
,
we
obtain
a
conjugacy
class
of
subgroups
of
AU
,
for
each
U,
which
is
compatible
with
all
iso∼
morphisms
U1
→
U2
.
[We
leave
the
routine
details
to
the
reader.]
At
any
rate,
this
yields
a
construction
of
the
canonical
fundamental
groups
of
Theorem
2.4.3
which
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
any
universal
covering
of
Q.

Anabelioids
Arising
from
Hyperbolic
Curves
§3.1.
Anabelioid-Theoretic
Interpretation
of
Scheme-Theoretic
Cores
In
the
following
discussion,
we
wish
to
translate
the
scheme-theoretic
theory
of
cores
in
the
context
of
hyperbolic
curves
(cf.
[Mzk9],
§2)
into
the
language
of
anabelioids
(cf.
the
proﬁnite
group-theoretic
approach
to
such
a
translation
given
in
[Mzk9],
§2).
The
main
technical
tool
that
will
enable
us
to
do
this
is
the
“Grothendieck
Conjecture”
—
i.e.,
Theorem
A
of
[Mzk6].
For
i
=
1,
2,
let
Fi
be
either
Q
or
Qpi
(for
some
prime
number
pi
).
Let
Ki
be
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Fi
.
Let
(Xi
)Ki
be
a
hyperbolic
orbicurve
over
Ki
.
Assume
that
we
have
chosen
basepoints
of
the
(Xi
)Ki
,
which
thus
induce
basepoints/algebraic
def
closures
K
i
of
the
Ki
and
determine
fundamental
groups
Π(Xi
)Ki
=
π1
((Xi
)Ki
)
and
def
Galois
groups
GKi
=
Gal(K
i
/Ki
).
Thus,
for
i
=
1,
2,
we
have
an
exact
sequence:
1
→
ΔXi
→
Π(Xi
)Ki
→
GKi
→
1
(where
ΔXi
⊆
Π(Xi
)Ki
is
deﬁned
so
as
to
make
the
sequence
exact).
Here,
we
shall
think
of
GKi
as
a
quotient
of
Π(Xi
)Ki
(i.e.,
not
as
an
independent
group
to
which
Π(Xi
)Ki
happens
to
surject).
One
knows
(cf.
[Mzk8],
Lemma
1.3.8)
that
this
quotient
Π(Xi
)Ki
→
GKi
is
an
intrinsic
invariant
of
the
proﬁnite
group
Π(Xi
)Ki
.
Next,
we
would
like
to
introduce
anabelioids
into
our
discussion.
Write:
def
def
Si
=
Ét(Ki
)
Xi
=
Ét((Xi
)Ki
);
Note
that
Xi
,
Si
are
slim
(cf.
[Mzk8],
Theorem
1.1.1,
(ii);
[Mzk8],
Lemma
1.3.1),
and
that
the
structure
morphisms
Xi
→
Si
are
relatively
slim
(cf.
[Mzk8],
Theorem
1.1.1,
(ii)).
Thus,
we
may
think
of
Xi
as
an
Si
-anabelioid
(cf.
§2.2).
In
particular,
we
may
consider
the
categories
LocSi
(Xi
);
LocSi
(Xi
)
of
§2.2.
In
the
following
discussion,
we
shall
work
with
anabelioids
“at
the
coarsiﬁed
level”
[i.e.,
in
Anab].

which
are

whenever

Here,
the
extension
functor
on
“Loc(−)’s”
(respectively,
“Loc(−)’s”)
is
a
full
embedding
(respectively,
equivalence).
Proof.
Indeed,
this
is
a
formal
consequence
of
[Mzk8],
Lemma
1.3.8
(and
Proposition
2.2.2,
(iv)).
Theorem
3.1.2.
(Anabelioid-Theoreticity
of
Correspondences)
Let
K
be
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
or
Q;
XK
a
hyperbolic
orbicurve
over
K;
write
def
def
X
=
Ét(XK
),
S
=
Ét(K).
Then
the
natural
functor
LocK
(XK
)
−→
LocS
(X
)
Z
→
Ét(Z)
(deﬁned
by
applying
“Ét(−)”)
is
an
equivalence
of
categories.
A
similar
assertion
holds
for
“Loc(−)”
replaced
by
“Loc(−)”.
In
particular,
XK
is
(respectively,
admits)
a
K-core
if
and
only
if
X
is
(respectively,
admits)
an
S-core.
Proof.
Since
“Loc(−)”
may
be
categorically
reconstructed
from
“Loc(−)”
via
the
same
recipe
for
both
schemes
and
anabelioids,
it
suﬃces
to
prove
the
asserted
equivalence
in
the
case
of
“Loc(−)”.
In
this
case,
it
is
immediate
from
the
deﬁnitions
that
the
functor
in
question
is
essentially
surjective.
It
follows
from
the
injectivity
of
[Mzk6],
Theorem
A
(cf.
also
Proposition
1.1.4)
that
this
functor
is
faithful.
Thus,
it
suﬃces
to
prove
that
this
functor
is
full.
Since
“fullness”
follows
from
Proposition
1.2.5,
(ii),
for
morphisms
over
X
,
it
suﬃces
(by
Proposition
2.2.2,
(iv))
to
prove
that
every
S-isomorphism
∼
Y
→Z
(where
Y,
Z
are
anabelioids
representing
objects
of
LocS
(X
))
arises
from
a
morphism
of
schemes
in
LocK
(XK
).
But
this
is
a
formal
consequence
of
[Mzk6],
Theorem
A
(cf.
also
Proposition
1.1.4).
Theorem
3.1.3.
(Absolute
Cores
over
Number
Fields)
Let
K
be
a
numdef
ber
ﬁeld;
XK
a
hyperbolic
orbicurve
over
K;
write
X
=
Ét(XK
).
Then:
48
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI*
(i)
XK
is
an
[absolute]
core
if
and
only
if
XK
is
a
K-core,
and,
moreover,
K
is
a
minimal
ﬁeld
of
deﬁnition
for
XK
.
(ii)
Applying
“Ét(−)”
induces
an
equivalence
of
categories:
∼
Loc(XK
)
→
Loc(X
)
In
particular,
X
is
(respectively,
admits)
an
[absolute]
core
if
and
only
if
XK
is
(respectively,
admits)
an
[absolute]
core.
(iii)
Suppose
that
XK
is
non-proper.
Then
X
admits
a
core
if
and
only
if
it
is
intrinsically
exhaustive.
Proof.
Assertion
(i)
follows
formally
from
[Mzk9],
Deﬁnition
2.1
and
[Mzk9],
Remark
2.1.1.
Assertion
(ii)
follows,
in
light
of
[Mzk8],
Theorem
1.1.3,
by
the
same
argument
as
that
used
to
prove
Theorem
3.1.2.
To
prove
assertion
(iii),
let
us
recall
from
the
theory
of
[Mzk3]
(cf.
[Mzk9],
Remark
2.1.2)
that
XK
[or,
equivalently,
by
assertion
(ii),
X
]
fails
to
admit
a
core
if
and
only
if
XK
is
isogenous
to
a
Shimura
curve.
Since
XK
is
assumed
to
be
non-proper,
this
Shimura
curve
may
be
taken
to
be
the
moduli
stack
of
hemi-elliptic
curves
(cf.
[Take],
p.
396,
second
paragraph).
Thus,
if
XK
fails
to
admit
a
core,
one
may
show
that
X
fails
to
be
intrinsically
exhaustive
by
using
Hecke
correspondences
on
the
moduli
stack
of
hemi-elliptic
curves,
as
in
Example
2.3.7,
(ii),
(iii)
(cf.
Proposition
2.3.5,
(iv)).
On
the
other
hand,
if
X
admits
a
core,
then
it
follows
from
Proposition
2.3.5,
(ii),
(viii),
that
X
is
intrinsically
exhaustive.
Remark
3.1.3.1.
One
expects
that
the
assumption
that
XK
be
non-proper
in
Theorem
3.1.3,
(iii),
is
inessential.
We
made
this
assumption
only
to
technically
simplify
the
proof
that
X
fails
to
be
intrinsically
exhaustive
(when
it
is
assumed
to
fail
to
admit
a
core).
The
point
of
Theorem
3.1.3,
(iii),
was
to
give
an
example
where
the
existence
of
a
core
is
equivalent
to
intrinsic
exhaustivity
(cf.
Remark
2.3.5.1),
since
this
contrasts
with
the
situation
that
occurs
in
the
p-adic
case
(cf.
Remark
3.1.6.1,
Corollary
3.1.7
below).
Corollary
3.1.4.
(Anabelioid-Theoreticity
of
Cores)
Let
α
:
X1
→
X2
be
a
ﬁnite
étale
morphism.
Then:
(i)
α
induces
—
in
a
fashion

with

to
α
—
a
pull-back
functor
LocK2
((X2

which
is

whenever
S1

and
is
equal
to
the
usual
scheme-theoretic
pull-back
functor
whenever
α
arises

(X1

if
(X2

is
K2

Similarly,
if

is
an
isomorphism,
then
(X1

is

If
a
ﬁnite
étale
morphism
(X2

(Z2

to
a
K2

(Z2

maps
(via
the
functor
of
(i))
to
a
ﬁnite

morphism
(X1

(Z1

,
then
(Z1

is
a

and,
moreover,
the
morphism
X1

extends
uniquely
to
a

(where
Zi
=
Ét((Zi

),
and
the
lower
horizontal
arrow
on
the

is
an
isomorphism).
Proof.
The
functor
of
(i)
is
obtained
by
composing
the
pull-back
functor
on
“Loc(−)’s”
of
Corollary
3.1.1
with
an
inverse
to
the
extension
functor
on
“Loc(−)’s”
of
Corollary
3.1.1
(which
is
an
equivalence),
and
then
applying
the
equivalences
of
Theorem
3.1.2
to
the
domain
and
codomain
of
this
composite.
Assertion
(ii)
is
a
formal
consequence
of
assertion
(i);
[Mzk9],
Deﬁnition
2.1;
[Mzk9],
Remark
2.1.1;
and
[Mzk9],
Proposition
2.3,
(i).
To
prove
assertion
(iii),
we
may
assume,
for
simplicity,
(cf.
Proposition
2.1.1,
(iv))
that
S1
→
S2
is
an
isomorphism.
Then
it
follows
that
the
pull-back
functor
on
“Loc(−)’s”
of
(i)
is
an
equivalence:
∼
LocK2
((X2
)K2
)
→
LocK1
((X1
)K1
)
Thus,
the
existence
of
an
extension
as
in
assertion
(iii)
follows
formally
by
thinking
of
Xi
,
Zi
as
subcategories
of
LocKi
((Xi
)Ki
)
(cf.
Proposition
1.2.5,
(ii)).
The
uniqueness
of
such
an
extension
is
a
formal
consequence
of
the
slimness
of
Zi
.
Proposition
3.1.5.
(Absolute
Degrees)
For
i
=
1,
2,
set:
def
degarith
(Xi
)
=
[Ki
:
Fi
]
and
deggeo
(Xi
)
equal
to
the
Euler
characteristic
of
(Xi
)Ki
.
[That
is
to
say,
if
(Xi
)Ki
is
a
hyperbolic
curve
of
type
(gi
,
ri
),
then
we
set
deggeo
(Xi
)
equal
to
2gi
−2+ri
;
more
generally,
if
(Xi
)Ki
is
only
an
orbicurve,
then
we
take
its
deggeo
(−)
to
be
the
deggeo
(−)
of
some
degree
d
ﬁnite
étale
covering
of
(Xi
)Ki
which
is
a
curve,
divided
by
d.]
Then
for
any
ﬁnite
étale
morphism
α
:
X1
→
X2
(which
thus
induces
a
commutative
diagram
as
in
Corollary
3.1.1),
we
have:
deggeo
(X1
)
=
deggeo
(X2
)·(deg(α)/
deg(αS
));
degarith
(X1
)
=
degarith
(X2
)·deg(αS
)
In
particular,
Xi
is
weakly
intrinsically
exhaustive.
We
shall
refer
to
deggeo
(Xi
)
(respectively,
degarith
(Xi
))
as
the
absolute
geometric
(respectively,
absolute
arithmetic)
degree
of
Xi
.

Proof.
Indeed,
this
follows
from
[Mzk8],
Lemma
1.3.9,
(for
the
absolute
geometric
degree)
and
[Mzk8],
Proposition
1.2.1,
(i),
(v)
(for
the
absolute
arithmetic
degree).
Remark
3.1.5.1.
Proposition
3.1.5
already
suggests
the
possibility
that,
under
the
further
assumption
that
(Xi
)Ki
admits
a
Ki
-core,
Xi
should
admit
a
faithful
quasi-core.
In
the
remainder
of
the
present
§,
we
shall
show
that
this
is,
in
fact,
the
case
(at
least
when
(Xi
)Ki
is
non-proper)
—
cf.
Theorem
3.1.6
below.
In
light
of
Proposition
2.3.5,
(ii);
Theorem
3.1.3,
(ii),
this
fact
is
primarily
of
interest
in
the
case
where
Ki
is
a
p-adic
local
ﬁeld
(although
we
shall
not
assume
this
to
be
the
case
in
the
following
discussion).
In
the
following
discussion,
we
would
like
to
assume
that:
(a)
The
hyperbolic
orbicurve
(Xi
)Ki
admits
a
Ki
-core
(Zi
)Ki
(where
i
=
1,
2).
(b)
The
anabelioids
X1
,
X2
are
isogenous.
Choose
basepoints
for
(Zi
)Ki
,
so
that
we
obtain,
for
i
=
1,
2,
exact
sequences:
1
→
ΔZi
→
Π(Zi
)Ki
→
GKi
→
1
def
Write
Zi
=
Ét((Zi
)Ki
).
Then
assumptions
(a),
(b);
Corollary
3.1.4,
(iii);
and
[Mzk8],
Lemma
1.3.9,
imply
that
(Z1
)K1
,
(Z2
)K2
are
hyperbolic
orbicurves
of
the
same
type
(g,
r).
Let
us
choose
once
and
for
all
a
model
Πg,r
of
the
geometric
fundamental
group
of
a
hyperbolic
orbicurve
of
type
(g,
r)
(in
characteristic
0).
To
simplify
notation,
in
the
following
discussion,
we
shall
simply
write
Π
for
Πg,r
.
Thus,
we
have
(noncanonical)
isomorphisms
Π
∼
=
ΔZi
.
Such
isomorphisms
induce
an
outer
homomorphism
Π(Zi
)Ki
→
Aut(Π)
which
is
independent
(as
an
outer
homomorphism)
of
the
choice
of
such
isomorphism
and,
moreover,
ﬁts
into
a
commutative
diagram:

THE
GEOMETRY
OF

51
Here,
we
observe
that
the
vertical
arrows
between
the
ﬁrst
and
second
lines
are
always
injective.
If,
moreover,
(Xi
)Ki
is
non-proper,
then
the
vertical
arrows
between
the
second
and
third
lines
are
also
injective
(by
the
theory
of
[Mtmo]
—
cf.
[Mzk8],
Theorem
1.3.6).
If
we
then
set
def
def
Zcom
=
B(Aut(Π))
→
Mcom
=
B(Out(Π))
—
i.e.,
we
wish
to
think
of
Zcom
→
Mcom
as
a
sort
of
“universal
combinatorial
model”
of
Zi
→
Si
—
then
we
obtain
a
commutative
diagram
of
connected
slim
anabelioids
Xi

Zcom
⏐
⏐
⏐

Si
id

Si

Mcom
in
which
the
horizontal
arrows
are
all
relatively
slim
(cf.
[Mzk8],
Theorem
1.1.1,
(ii);
[Mzk8],
Lemma
1.3.1;
[Mzk6],
Theorem
A).
Next,
let
us
observe
that
the
intrinsic
nature
of
the
anabelioid
associated
to
a
geometric
core
(cf.
Corollary
3.1.4,
(iii))
implies
that
the
morphism
Xi
→
Zcom
is
functorial
with
respect
to
arbitrary
ﬁnite
étale
morphisms
X1
→
X2
.
Finally,
let
us
observe
that
Aut(Π)
(hence
also
Out(Π))
is
countably
(topologically)
generated.
Indeed,
to
show
this,
it
suﬃces
to
show
the
existence
of
a
descending
sequence
of
open
subgroups
.
.
.
⊆
An+1
⊆
An
⊆
.
.
.
⊆
Aut(Π)
such
that
n
An
=
{1}.
To
this
end,
let
us
note
that
Π
admits
a
descending
sequence
of
open
characteristic
subgroups
.
.
.
⊆
Π[n
+
1]
⊆
Π[n]
⊆
.
.
.
⊆
Aut(Π)
such
that
n
Π[n]
=
{1}.
Thus,
if
we
set
def
An
=
Ker(Aut(Π)
→
Aut(Π/Π[n]))
we
obtain
a
sequence
{An
}
with
the
desired
properties.
Thus,
in
summary,
we
see
that
we
have
proven
(most
of)
the
following:
Theorem
3.1.6.
(The
Quasi-Core
Associated
to
a
Geometric
Core)
Let
K
be
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
or
Q;
XK
a
hyperbolic
orbicurve
over
K
which
admits
a
K-core
ZK
of
type
(g,
r).
Write:
def
X
=
Ét(XK
);
Then:
def
Z
=
Ét(ZK
);
def
Zcom
=
B(Aut(Πg,r
));
def
Mcom
=
B(Out(Πg,r
))
52
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI*
(i)
ZK
determines
a
Zcom
-holomorphic
structure
X
→
Zcom
on
X
which
is
a
quasi-core
for
X
.
In
particular,
the
theory
of
§2.3,
2.4
may
be
applied
to
X
.
(ii)
If
XK
is
non-proper,
then
this
quasi-core
is
faithful
and,
moreover,
obtained
as
the
quasi-core
associated
to
an
intrinsic
proﬁnite
subgroup
(cf.
Proposition
2.4.5).
Finally,
if
K
is
a
number
ﬁeld
which
is
a
minimal
ﬁeld
of
deﬁnition
for
ZK
,
then
the
morphism
Z
→
Zcom
is
commensurably
terminal.
Proof.
It
remains
only
to
observe
that
the
ﬁnal
part
of
(ii)
is
a
formal
consequence
of
Theorem
3.1.3,
(i),
(ii);
Proposition
2.2.5.
def
Remark
3.1.6.1.
In
the
case
of
p-adic
local
ﬁelds,
one
does
not
expect
Z
=
Ét(ZK
)
to
be
a
core
(even
if
K
is
a
minimal
extension
of
Qp
over
which
ZK
is
deﬁned).
Nevertheless,
Theorem
3.1.6
shows
that
Z
has
the
interesting
property
of
being
“closer
to
being
a
core”
than,
for
instance,
P
GL2
(Qp
)
(cf.
Example
2.3.7,
(ii),
(iii);
Theorem
3.1.3,
(iii);
Corollary
3.1.7
below).
Remark
3.1.6.2.
Our
use
of
[Mzk8],
Theorem
1.3.6
[i.e.,
the
main
result
of
[Mtmo]]
in
the
above
construction
of
a
faithful
quasi-core
—
which
(by
the
theory
of
§2.4)
allows
us
to
construct
“canonical
fundamental
groups”,
i.e.,
to
assign
canonical
names,
or
labels
(up
to
conjugacy)
to
the
elements
of
the
fundamental
group
—
is
reminiscent
of
the
essential
idea
lying
behind
the
theory
of
the
Grothendieck-Teichmüller
group,
which
applies
this
same
injectivity
to
assign
canonical
names
(up
to
conjugacy)
to
the
elements
of
GQ
.
It
is
interesting
to
note,
however,
that
although
this
theory
of
the
Grothendieck-Teichmüller
group
is
typically
applied
to
analyzing
GQ
,
in
fact,
(by
the
“Neukirch-Uchida
Theorem”
—
cf.,
e.g.,
[Mzk8],
Theorem
1.1.3)
the
elements
of
GQ
already
possess
intrinsic,
canonically
determined
names
(up
to
conjugacy).
Thus,
the
ability
to
assign
canonically
determined
names
has
much
greater
signiﬁcance
in
the
case
of
p-adic
local
ﬁelds.
Remark
3.1.6.3.
Relative
to
Remark
3.1.6.2,
it
is
also
interesting
to
note
that,
just
as
the
theory
of
§2.4
only
applies
in
the
case
where
the
curve
in
question
admits
a
geometric
core,
the
theory
of
the
Grothendieck-Teichmüller
group
centers
around
considering
not
just
the
projective
line
minus
three
points
—
a
curve
which
fails
to
admit
a
geometric
core
—
but
instead
a
certain
system
of
moduli
stacks
of
hyperbolic
curves,
which
includes,
for
instance,
the
moduli
stack
of
hyperbolic
curves
of
type
(0,
5)
which
(by
[Mzk3],
Theorem
C)
does
admit
a
geometric
core.
Finally,
we
have
the
following
analogue
of
Theorem
3.1.3,
(iii),
which
is
valid
in
the
local
p-adic
case
as
well:
Corollary
3.1.7.
(Criteria
for
the
Existence
of
a
Geometric
Core)
Let
K
be
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
or
Q;
XK
a
non-proper
hyperbolic
orbicurve
def
over
K;
write
X
=
Ét(XK
).
Then
the
following
assertions
are
equivalent:
THE
GEOMETRY
OF
ANABELIOIDS
53
(i)
XK
admits
a
K-core.
(ii)
X
admits
a
faithful
quasi-core.
(iii)
X
is
intrinsically
exhaustive.
Proof.
This
is
a
formal
consequence
of
Theorem
3.1.6,
(i),
(ii);
Proposition
2.3.5,
(viii);
and
the
existence
of
Hecke
correspondences
(cf.
the
proof
of
Theorem
3.1.3,
(iii))
when
XK
does
not
admit
a
K-core.
Remark
3.1.7.1.
The
implication
(i)
=⇒
(iii)
of
Corollary
3.1.7
(in
the
p-adic
case)
is
somewhat
surprising
in
light
of
Example
2.3.7,
(v).
That
is
to
say,
Corollary
3.1.7
implies
that
(when
XK
admits
a
K-core)
the
rigidity
of
Ét(XK
)
is
suﬃciently
strong
to
eliminate
the
non-intrinsic
exhaustivity
of
Ét(K).
In
particular,
we
conclude
in
this
case
that
the
natural
inclusion
COut(Δ
Z
)
(GK
)
→
Isog(GK
)
fails
to
be
surjective
(cf.
Propositions
2.3.5,
(viii);
2.3.6,
(iii)).
§3.2.
The
Logarithmic
Special
Fiber
via
Quasi-Cores
In
this
§,
we
interpret
the
results
of
[Mzk8],
§2,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
theory
of
quasi-cores
—
cf.
§2.3,
2.4.
Let
XK
be
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
a
ﬁnite
extension
K
of
Qp
.
Denote
the
ring
of
integers
(respectively,
residue
ﬁeld)
of
K
by
OK
(respectively,
k);
also
we
shall
use
notation
such
as
“k
log
”,
“(k
log
)∼
”,
as
in
[Mzk8],
§2.
Assume
that
XK
admits
a
stable
model
over
OK
(cf.
[Mzk8],
§2),
as
well
as
a
K-core
ZK
,
and
that
XK
is
Galois
over
ZK
.
Then
we
deﬁne
the
stable
model
of
ZK
to
be
the
quotient
—
in
the
sense
of
[log]
stacks
—
of
the
stable
model
of
XK
by
Gal(XK
/ZK
).
Let
us
denote
the
logarithmic
special
ﬁbers
of
the
stable
models
of
XK
,
ZK
by
Xklog
,
Zklog
,
respectively.
Write:
def
X
=
Ét(XK
);
def
Z
=
Ét(ZK
)
Also,
let
us
write
Zcom
for
the
quasi-core
(for
X
,
Z)
of
Theorem
3.1.6.
Now
recall
from
[Mzk8],
the
discussion
following
Remark
2.5.3,
the
“universal
admissible
covering”
Xklog
→
Xklog
of
Xklog
determined
by
the
admissible
quotient
ΠXK

Πadm
XK
.
Put
another
way,
this
covering
is
the
composite
of
all
admissible
coverings
(cf.
[Mzk4],
§3)
of
Xklog
×klog
54
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI*
(k
log
)∼
.
In
the
following
discussion,
let
us
denote
the
category
of
(disjoint
unions
of
coverings
isomorphic
to)
subcoverings
of
this
universal
admissible
covering
(respectively,
subcoverings
of
the
“geometric
universal
admissible
covering”
Xklog
→
Xklog
×klog
(k
log
)∼
)
by:
Étadm
(Xklog
)
(respectively,
Étadm
(Xklog
×klog
(k
log
)∼
))
To
keep
the
notation
simple,
we
set:
def
X0
=
Étadm
(Xklog
);
def
X
0
=
Étadm
(Xklog
×klog
(k
log
)∼
)
[so
the
fundamental
group
of
X0
(respectively,
X
0
)
may
be
identiﬁed
with
Πadm
XK
adm
adm
(respectively,
the
geometric
portion
Δadm
⊆
Π
of
Π
—
cf.
[Mzk8],
§2)].
XK
XK
XK
Similarly,
we
may
construct
def
Z0
=
Étadm
(Zklog
)
[for
instance,
as
the
quotient
of
X0
by
the
faithful
action
on
X0
of
the
ﬁnite
group
Gal(XK
/ZK
)].
Next,
let
us
write
Q0
for
the
“anabelioid
quotient”
of
X
0
by
the
natural
action
on
X
0
by
the
proﬁnite
group
Aut(Xklog
×klog
(k
log
)∼
)
[i.e.,
the
group
of
automorphisms
of
the
abstract
log
scheme
which
do
not

lie
over
k
log
or
(k

!].
That
is
to
say,
at
the
level
of
proﬁnite
groups,
the
fundamental
group
of
the
anabelioid
Q0
is
the
extension
of
the
proﬁnite
group
Aut(Xklog
×klog
(k
log
)∼
)
by
the
[slim!
—
cf.
[Mzk8],
Lemma
2.2,
(i)]
fundamental
group
of
X
0
determined
by
the
natural
outer
action
of
the
former
proﬁnite
group
on
the
latter.
Note
that
by
the
deﬁnition
of
“Aut”,
the
slimness
of
X
0
,
and
the
slimness
of
Gal((klog
)∼
/k
log
)
[cf.
[Mzk8],
Proposition
1.2.3,
(iii)],
it
follows
that
Q0
is
also
slim.
Thus,
we
have
a
commutative
diagram
of
natural
relatively
slim
morphisms
of
slim,
connected
anabelioids

Theorem
3.2.1.
(The
Admissible
Quotient
as
Quasi-Core)
Assume
that
X
→
Z
is
Zcom
-Galois.
Then
the
morphism
X
→
Q0
is
a
quasi-core.
In
particular,
the
theory
of
§2.3,
2.4
may
be
applied
to
this
morphism.
Proof.
By
the
functoriality
of
the
anabelioid
associated
to
a
geometric
core
[(cf.
Corollary
3.1.4,
(iii)]
and
our
hypothesis
that
X
→
Z
is
Zcom
-Galois
[cf.
Proposition
2.3.5,
(vii)],
it
follows
that
it
suﬃces
to
consider,
for
K

a
ﬁnite
extension
of
K,
the
behavior
of
automorphisms
of
the
quotient
(ΠX
⊇)
ΠXK


Πadm
XK

(⊆
ΠX0
)
induced
by
arbitrary
automorphisms
of
ΠXK

.
By
[Mzk8],
Theorem
2.7,
it
follows
that
such
automorphisms
of
Πadm
XK

necessarily
arise
from
automorphisms
of
the
logarithmic
special
ﬁber
of
XK

.
Thus,
we
conclude
by
the
deﬁnition
of
Q0
and
the
easily
veriﬁed
fact
that
base-change
to
totally
wildly
ramiﬁed
extensions
K

of
K

does
not
aﬀect
the
automorphism
group
of
the
logarithmic
special
ﬁber.
Remark
3.2.1.1.
Note
that
the
anabelian
nature
of
the
logarithmic
special
ﬁber
(i.e.,
[Mzk8],
Theorem
2.7)
is
applied
in
Theorem
3.2.1
in
a
fashion
similar
to
the
way
in
which
the
anabelian
nature
of
hyperbolic
curves
over
number
ﬁelds
is
applied
in
Theorem
3.1.3,
(ii).
