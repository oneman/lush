In
§0.6,
§0.9
of
the
Introduction,
the
captions
and
actual
illustrations
of
Fig.
3,
4
[i.e.,
the
complex
and
p-adic
cases]
are
reversed.
The
illustration
in
the
p-adic
case
appears
with
the
correct
caption
in
Fig.
3
of
§1.6
of
[3].
(2.)
In
line
4
of
Theorem
1.3,
(3),
of
§1.2
of
the
Introduction,
“odd”
should
read
“even”.
This
result
is
stated
correctly
in
the
body
of
the
text
—
e.g.,
Chapter
IV,
Theorem
3.2;
Chapter
V,
§1.
(3.)
In
the
statement
of
the
criterion
(*)
in
the
discussion
following
Chapter
I,
Deﬁnition
2.8,
the
word
“horizontal”
in
the
second
and
third
lines
following
the
display
should
be
replaced
by
“vertical”.
(4.)
In
Chapter
II,
§2.3,
the
“versal
families”
should
be
understood
as
being
possibly
empty.
In
particular,
in
item
(1)
of
the
statements
of
Chapter
II,
Theorem
2.8,
Corollary
2.9,
the
phrase
“smooth
of
dimension
...”
should
be
replaced
by
“smooth
of
dimension
...
(if
it
is
not
empty)”
(cf.
the
phrasing
of
the
ﬁnal
paragraph
of
the
statement
of
Chapter
II,
Theorem
2.8).
(5.)
In
the
second
sentence
of
the
third
paragraph
of
§2.3.1
of
the
Introduction,
the
phrase
“the
hypercohomology
of
this
complex”
should
read
“the
ﬁrst
hypercohomology
module
of
this
complex”.
(6.)
With
regard
to
the
notation
“N
log
⊗Zp
Qp
”,
“C
log
⊗Zp
Qp
”
in
the
paragraph
immediately
preceding
Theorem
0.4
of
§0.9
of
the
Introduction,
we
note
the
following:
Let
K
be
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Qp
and
Y
a
formally
smooth
p-adic
formal
scheme
over
the
ring
of
integers
OK
of
K,
i.e.,
such
as
a
suitable
étale
localization
of
N
or
C.
Then
Y
×Zp
Qp
(i.e.,
“Y
⊗Zp
Qp
”)
is
deﬁned
as
the
ringed
space
obtained
by
tensoring
the
structure
sheaf
of
Y
over
OK
with
K.
Thus,
if,
for
instance,
Y
is
the
formal
scheme
obtained
as
the
formal
inverse
limit
of
an
inverse
system
of
schemes

where
n
ranges
over
the
positive
integers,
and
each
“→”
is
a
nilpotent
thickening
—
and
U
is
an
aﬃne
open
of
the
common
underlying
topological
space
of
the
Yn
,
then
the
rings
of
sections
of
the
respective
structure
sheaves
OY
,
OY
of
Y,
Y
over
U
are,
by
deﬁnition,
given
as
follows:
def
OY
(U
)
=
←
lim
−
OYn
(U
);
n
def
OY
(U
)
=
OY
(U
)
⊗OK
K.
Here,
we
observe
that
OY
(U
)
is
the
p-adic
completion
of
a
normal
noetherian
ring
of
ﬁnite
type
over
OK
.
In
particular,
we
observe
that
one
may
consider
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
of
Y
,
i.e.,
by
considering
systems
of
ﬁnite
étale
algebras
AU
over
the
various
OY
(U
)
[that
is
to
say,
as
U
is
allowed
to
vary
over
the
aﬃne
opens
of
the
Yn
]
equipped
with
gluings
over
the
intersections
of
the
various
U
that
appear.
Note,
moreover,
that
by
considering
the
normalizations
of
the
OY
(U
)
in
AU
,
we
conclude
[cf.
the
discussion
of
the
Remark
immediately
following
Theorem
2.6
in
Section
II
of
[1]]
that
def
(NorFor)
any
such
system
{AU
}U
may
be
obtained
as
the
W
=
W
×OK
K
for
some
formal
scheme
W
that
is
ﬁnite
over
Y,
and
that
arises
as
the
formal
inverse
limit
of
an
inverse
system
of
schemes

where

each

each
aﬃne
open
V
of
the
common
underlying
topological
space
of

,
OW
(V
)
is
the
p-adic
completion
of
a
normal
noetherian
ring
of
ﬁnite
type
over
OK
.
Indeed,
this
follows
from
well-known
considerations
in
commutative
algebra,
which
we
review
as
follows.
Let
R
be
a
normal
noetherian
ring
of
ﬁnite
type
over
a
complete
discrete
valuation
ring
A
[i.e.,
such
as
OK
in
the
above
discussion]
with
maximal
ideal
mA
and
quotient
ﬁeld
F
such
that
R
is
separated
in
the
mA
-adic
topology.
Thus,
since
A
is
excellent
[cf.
[2],
Scholie
7.8.3,
(iii)],
it
follows
[cf.
[2],

of
R
is
Scholie
7.8.3,
(ii)]
that
R
is
excellent,
hence
that
the
mA
-adic
completion
R
also
normal
[cf.
[2],
Scholie
7.8.3,
(v)].
Then
it
is
well-known
and
easily
veriﬁed
[by
applying
a
well-known
argument
involving
the
trace
map]
that
the
normalization

Let
S
be

in
any
ﬁnite
étale
algebra
over
R

⊗A
F
is
a
ﬁnite
algebra
over
R.
of
R

such
a
ﬁnite
algebra
over
R.
Then
it
follows
immediately
from
a
suitable
version
of
“Hensel’s
Lemma”
[cf.,
e.g.,
the
argument
of
[4],
Lemma
2.1]
that
S
may
be
obtained,
as
the
notation
suggests,
as
the
mA
-adic
completion
of
a
ﬁnite
algebra
S
over
R,
which
may
in
fact
be
assumed
to
be
separated
in
the
mA
-adic
topology
and
[by
replacing
S
by
its
normalization
and
applying
[2],
Scholie
7.8.3,
(v),
(vi)]
normal.
Let
f
∈
R
be
an
element
that
maps
to
a
non-nilpotent
element
of
R/mA
·R.
def
def
f
,
Sf
for
the
respective
mA
-adic
completions
Write
Rf
=
R[f
−1
];
Sf
=
S
⊗R
Rf
;
R
of
Rf
,
Sf
.
Then
it
follows
again
from
[2],
Scholie
7.8.3,
(v),
that
Sf
,
which
may

be
naturally
identiﬁed
[since
S
is
a
ﬁnite
algebra
over
R]
with
S
⊗R

Rf
,
is
normal.
That
is
to
say,
it
follows
immediately
that
(NorForZar)
the
operation
of
forming
normalizations
[i.e.,
as
in
the
above
discussion]
is
compatible
with
Zariski
localization
on
the
given
formal
scheme.

On
the
other
hand,
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
(NorFor)
follows
formally
from
(NorForZar).
