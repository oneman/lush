In this paper, we study the pro-Σ anabelian geometry of hyperbolic
curves, where Σ is a nonempty set of prime numbers, over Galois groups of “solvably closed extensions” of number ﬁelds — i.e., inﬁnite extensions of number ﬁelds
which have no nontrivial abelian extensions. The main results of this paper are, in
essence, immediate corollaries of the following three ingredients: (a) classical results
concerning the structure of Galois groups of number ﬁelds; (b) an anabelian result of
Uchida concerning Galois groups of solvably closed extensions of number ﬁelds; (c) a
previous result of the author concerning the pro-Σ anabelian geometry of hyperbolic
curves over nonarchimedean local ﬁelds.

Introduction
In this paper, we study various properties of solvably closed Galois groups of
number ﬁelds, i.e., Galois groups of ﬁeld extensions of number ﬁelds that admit no
nontrivial abelian ﬁeld extensions [cf. Deﬁnition 1.1, (i)]. In §1, we show that such
Galois groups satisfy many of the properties of absolute Galois groups of number
ﬁelds that are of importance in the context of anabelian geometry. In particular, this
includes properties concerning Galois cohomology, center-free-ness, decomposition
groups of valuations, and topologically ﬁnitely generated closed normal subgroups.
In §2, after reviewing a fundamental result of Uchida [cf. [Uchida]] to the eﬀect that
solvably closed Galois groups of number ﬁelds are anabelian, we apply the various
results obtained in §1 to give a new version of the main result of [Mzk2] concerning
the pro-Σ anabelian geometry of hyperbolic curves, where Σ is a nonempty set of
prime numbers, in the context of solvably closed Galois groups of number ﬁelds.
Finally, in §3, we observe that “relatively small” solvably closed Galois groups
of number ﬁelds exist in “substantial abundance”. For instance, in the case of

punctured elliptic curves, it is possible in many instances to obtain solvably closed
Galois groups of number ﬁelds that are, on the one hand, “large enough” to be
compatible with the outer Galois action on the pro-Σ geometric fundamental group
of the punctured elliptic curve [i.e., in the sense that this outer Galois action of the
Galois group of the number ﬁeld factors through the quotient determined by the
solvably closed extension], but, on the other hand, “small enough” to be linearly
disjoint from various ﬁeld extensions arising from the l-torsion points of the elliptic
curve, for a prime number l ∈
/ Σ.

Section 1: Basic Properties
We begin by deﬁning the notion of a solvably closed Galois group of a number
ﬁeld and showing that such Galois groups satisfy many properties that are wellknown in the case of absolute Galois groups of number ﬁelds.
Let F be a number ﬁeld [i.e., a ﬁnite extension of the ﬁeld of rational numbers],
F an algebraic closure of F , and F ⊆ F a [not necessarily ﬁnite!] Galois extension
def
def
of F . Write GF = Gal(F /F ), QF = Gal(F/F ). Thus, one may think of QF as a
quotient GF  QF of GF .
Deﬁnition 1.1.
(i) We shall say that a ﬁeld is solvably closed if it has no nontrivial abelian
extensions. If F is solvably closed, then we shall say that F /F is a solvably closed
extension and refer to QF as a solvably closed Galois group of the number ﬁeld F .
(ii) If G is any proﬁnite group, and p is a prime number, then we shall write
cdp (G)
for the smallest positive integer i such that H j (G, A) = 0 for all continuous ptorsion G-modules A and all j > i, if such an integer i exists; if such an integer i
def
does not exist, then we set cdp (G) = ∞ [cf. [NSW], Deﬁnition 3.3.1].
Remark 1.1.1. Observe that the Galois group QF is solvably closed if and only
if, for any open subgroup HQ ⊆ QF , whose inverse image in GF we denote by
HG ⊆ GF , the surjection induced on maximal pro-solvable quotients
sol
sol
HG
 HQ

GLOBAL SOLVABLY CLOSED ANABELIAN GEOMETRY

by the quotient morphism HG  HQ is an isomorphism.
Remark 1.1.2. Thus, if we denote by Fsol ⊆ F the maximal solvable [Galois]
extension of F, then one veriﬁes immediately that Gal(F sol /F ) is a solvably closed
Galois group of the number ﬁeld F . In particular, [by taking F = F , it follows
that] the maximal pro-solvable quotient Gsol
F of GF is a solvably closed Galois group
of the number ﬁeld F .
Remark 1.1.3. One veriﬁes immediately that any open subgroup of a solvably
closed Galois group of a number ﬁeld is again a solvably closed Galois group of a
number ﬁeld.
Proposition 1.2. (Galois Cohomology of Solvably Closed Galois Groups)
Suppose that QF is a solvably closed Galois group of the number ﬁeld F . Then:
(i) The natural surjection GF  QF induces an isomorphism
∼

H i (QF , A) → H i (GF , A)
for all continuous torsion QF -modules A and all integers i ≥ 0. In particular, if F
contains a square root of −1, then cdp (QF ) = 2 for all prime numbers p.
(ii) Let p be a prime number; suppose that F contains a primitive p-th
root of unity. Then for any automorphism σ of the ﬁeld F that preserves and
acts nontrivially on F ⊆ F, the automorphism induced by σ of the set of onedimensional Fp -subspaces of the Fp -vector space
H 2 (QF , Fp )
is nontrivial.
def

Proof. First, we consider assertion (i). Write JF = Ker(GF  QF ). To show the
desired isomorphism, it follows immediately from the Leray-Serre spectral sequence
associated to the extension 1 → JF → GF → QF → 1 that it suﬃces to show that
H i (JF , A) = 0 for all i ≥ 1. Since
H i (JF , A) ∼
=

lim
−→

JF ⊆H⊆GF

H i (H, A)

[where H ranges over the open subgroups of GF containing JF ], we thus conclude
the desired vanishing as follows: If i ≥ 3, then the fact that H i (H, A) = 0 follows
from the fact that cdp (H) ≤ 2, for H suﬃciently small [i.e., H that correspond to
totally imaginary extensions of F — cf. [NSW], Proposition 8.3.17]. If i = 2, then
we recall that by the well-known “Hasse Principle for central simple algebras” [cf.,

4

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

e.g., [NSW], Corollary 8.1.16; the discussion of [NSW], §7.1], it follows that we have
an exact sequence

H 2 (Gv , Fp (1)) → Fp → 0
0 → H 2 (GF , Fp (1)) →
v

where the “(1)” denotes a “Tate twist”; v ranges over the valuations of F ; Gv denotes the decomposition group of v in GF , which is well-deﬁned up to conjugation;
and we recall in passing that the restriction to the various direct summands of the
map to Fp induces an isomorphism H 2 (Gv , Fp (1)) ∼
= Fp for all nonarchimedean
v. Thus, by applying the analogue for H of this exact sequence for GF , together
with the Grunwald-Wang Theorem [which assures the existence of global abelian
ﬁeld extensions with prescribed behavior at a ﬁnite number of valuations — cf.,
2
e.g., [NSW], Corollary 9.2.3], we conclude immediately that −
lim
→H H (H, A) = 0.
1
When i = 1, the fact that −
lim
→H H (H, A) = 0 follows formally from the deﬁnition
of a “solvably closed” Galois group [cf. Deﬁnition 1.1, (i)]. Now the statement concerning cdp (QF ) follows immediately from the isomorphism just veriﬁed, together
with the fact that, if F contains a square root of −1 [hence is totally imaginary],
then cdp (GF ) = 2 [cf. [NSW], Proposition 8.3.17; the exact sequence just discussed
concerning H 2 (GF , Fp (1))]. This completes the proof of assertion (i).
Finally, we observe that assertion (ii) follows immediately from the exact sequence just discussed concerning
H 2 (GF , Fp (1)) ∼
= H 2 (QF , Fp (1)) ∼
= H 2 (QF , Fp )
[cf. assertion (i); our assumption that F contains a primitive p-th root of unity],
together with Tchebotarev’s density theorem [cf., e.g., [Lang], Chapter VIII, §4,
Theorem 10], which implies that if we write F0 ⊆ F for the subﬁeld ﬁxed by σ,
then there exist two distinct nonarchimedean valuations v1 , v2 of F0 that split
completely in F . That is to say, if w1 , w2 are valuations of F lying over v1 , v2 ,
respectively, then there exists an element h ∈ H 2 (QF , Fp ) ∼
= H 2 (GF , Fp (1)) [where
we note that this isomorphism is compatible with the natural actions by σ, up to
multiplication by an element of F×
p ] which maps to a nonzero element of the direct
sum in the above sequence whose unique nonzero components are the components
labeled by v1 , v2 ; thus, σ(Fp · h) = Fp · h, as desired.
Remark 1.2.1. As was pointed out to the author by the referee, one may generalize Proposition 1.2, (i), substantially if one assumes the Bloch-Kato conjecture
— i.e., the assertion that the cup product
∪ : H 1 (GK , Fp (1))⊗i → H i (GK , Fp (i))
induces a surjection for every integer i ≥ 1, every prime number p, and every
ﬁeld K of characteristic zero. Indeed, if GK  QK is a quotient by a closed
 of K which has
normal subgroup JK ⊆ GK corresponding to a ﬁeld extension K
no nontrivial abelian extensions, then to show that the natural morphism
H i (QK , A) → H i (GK , A)

GLOBAL SOLVABLY CLOSED ANABELIAN GEOMETRY

5

is an isomorphism for all integers i ≥ 0 and continuous torsion QK -modules A, it
suﬃces to verify [cf. the proof of Proposition 1.2, (i)], in the case A = Fp , that for
all open subgroups H ⊆ GK containing JK , an arbitrary class ∈ H i (H, A) vanishes
upon restriction to a suﬃciently small open subgroup H1 ⊆ H containing JK ; but
 has no nontrivial abelian extensions if i = 1, hence
this follows from the fact that K
by the Bloch-Kato conjecture if i ≥ 2.
Before proceeding, we recall that a proﬁnite group Δ is slim if every open
subgroup of Δ has trivial centralizer in Δ [cf. [Mzk1], Deﬁnition 0.1, (i)].
Corollary 1.3.
ﬁeld is slim.

(Slimness) Every solvably closed Galois group of a number

Proof. Suppose that QF is solvably closed. Let HQ ⊆ QF be an open subgroup,
σ ∈ QF an element of the centralizer of HQ . Write FH ⊆ F for the extension of F
deﬁned by HQ . Since QF is solvably closed, by taking HQ to be suﬃciently small,
we may assume that FH contains a p-th root of unity, for some prime number p.
Note that since σ commutes with HQ , it follows that σ acts trivially on H 2 (HQ , Fp ).
Thus, by applying Proposition 1.2, (ii), to the action of σ on F/FH , we conclude
that σ acts trivially on FH , i.e., that σ ∈ HQ . On the other hand, since HQ may
be taken to be arbitrarily small, it thus follows that σ = 1, as desired.
The next two results, concerning decomposition groups and topologically ﬁnitely
generated closed normal subgroups, respectively, are well-known in the case of absolute Galois groups [cf., e.g., [NSW], Corollary 12.1.3; [FJ], Proposition 16.11.6].
Proposition 1.4. (Decomposition Groups) Suppose that QF is a solvably
closed Galois group of the number ﬁeld F . Let v, w be valuations of F such
that v = w; write Gv , Gw ⊆ QF for the corresponding decomposition groups
[which are well-deﬁned up to conjugation] in QF and Fv , Fw for the corresponding
completions of F . Then:
(i) Suppose that F contains a square root of −1, and that v, w are nonarchimedean; let K be a ﬁnite extension of Fv . Then there exists a ﬁnite Galois
extension of F contained in F whose restriction to Fv contains K and whose restriction to Fw is the trivial extension.
(ii) Suppose that v, w are archimedean; let K be a nontrivial ﬁnite extension
of Fv . Then there exists a quadratic extension of F contained in F whose restriction
to Fv contains K and whose restriction to Fw is the trivial extension.
(iii) The surjection GF  QF induces an isomorphism of Gv with the decomposition group of v in GF . In particular, if v is nonarchimedean, then Gv is
slim and torsion-free.

(iv) Gv Gw = {1}.

6

(v) Suppose that v is archimedean (respectively, nonarchimedean). Then
the normalizer (respectively, commensurator) of Gv in QF is equal to Gv .
Proof. First, we consider assertion (i). Since the absolute Galois group of Fv is
pro-solvable [cf., e.g., [NSW], Chapter VII, §5], we may assume, by recursion, that
K is an abelian extension of Fv . Since, moreover, F contains a square root of −1, it
follows that we may apply the Grunwald-Wang Theorem [cf., e.g., [NSW], Corollary
9.2.3] to F . Now assertion (i) follows immediately by applying the Grunwald-Wang
Theorem to F . Assertion (ii) follows by considering the quadratic extension of F
determined by taking the square root of an element f ∈ F which is < 0 at v and
either > 0 or nonreal at w [where we note that the existence of such an f follows
immediately from the fact that the valuations v, w are distinct]. In the nonarchimedean case, assertion (iii) follows formally from assertion (i), together with the
well-known facts that the absolute Galois group of a nonarchimedean local ﬁeld is
slim [cf., e.g., [Mzk1], Theorem 1.1.1, (ii)] and [of ﬁnite cohomological dimension
— cf., e.g., [NSW], Corollary 7.2.5 — hence] torsion-free. In the archimedean case,
assertion (iii) follows, for instance, by considering the extension of F obtained by
adjoining a square root of −1. To verify assertion (iv), let us ﬁrst observe that if
at least one of v, w is nonarchimedean, then it follows from the torsion-free-ness
portion of assertion (iii) that both v, w are nonarchimedean [cf. also the wellknown fact that the absolute Galois group of an archimedean local ﬁeld is ﬁnite, of
order ≤ 2!], and, moreover, that [from the point of view of verifying assertion (iv)]
one may replace F by a ﬁnite abelian extension of F that satisﬁes the hypothesis
of assertion (i). Now assertion (iv) follows immediately from assertions (i), (ii),
(iii). Finally, assertion (v) follows formally from assertion (iv) [together with the
torsion-free-ness portion of assertion (iii) in the nonarchimedean case].
Theorem 1.5.
(Topologically Finitely Generated Closed Normal Subgroups) Suppose that F is a Galois extension of the number ﬁeld F such that for
some prime number p, F has no cyclic extensions of degree p [e.g., a solvably
closed extension of F ]. Then every topologically ﬁnitely generated closed normal
subgroup N ⊆ QF is trivial.
Proof. Although this fact only follows formally from the statement of [FJ], Proposition 16.11.6, in the case where F is algebraically closed, as was explained to the
author by A. Tamagawa, the proof given in [FJ] generalizes immediately to the
case of arbitrary F [i.e., as in the statement of Theorem 1.5]: Indeed, if we write
L ⊆ F for the Galois [since N is normal] ﬁeld extension of F determined by N , and
assume that N is nontrivial, then it follows that there exists a proper normal open
subgroup N1 ⊆ N of N . Thus, N1 determines a ﬁnite Galois extension L1 /L of
degree > 1. Now let us recall that number ﬁelds [such as F ] are Hilbertian [cf., e.g.,
[FJ], Theorem 13.4.2]. Thus, by [FJ], Theorem 13.9.1, (b) [i.e., “Weissauer’s extension theorem for Hilbertian ﬁelds”], we conclude that L1 is Hilbertian, hence, by
[repeated application of] [FJ], Theorem 16.11.2, that L1 admits Galois extensions
with Galois group isomorphic to a product of an arbitrary ﬁnite number of copies

GLOBAL SOLVABLY CLOSED ANABELIAN GEOMETRY

of Z/pZ. By our assumption on F , it follows that such Galois extensions of L1 are
contained in F, hence that N1 admits ﬁnite quotients isomorphic to a product of
an arbitrary ﬁnite number of copies of Z/pZ. But this contradicts the assumption
that N is topologically ﬁnitely generated.

Section 2: Anabelian Results
Next, we consider the anabelian geometry of hyperbolic curves, in the context
of solvably closed Galois groups of number ﬁelds.
The following result is due to K. Uchida [cf. the main theorem of [Uchida]]:
Theorem 2.1.
(Solvably Closed Galois Groups are Anabelian) For
def
i = 1, 2, let Fi /Fi be a solvably closed extension of a number ﬁeld Fi ; write Qi =
Gal(Fi /Fi ). Then passing to the induced morphism on Galois groups determines a
bijection between the set of isomorphisms of topological groups
∼

Q1 → Q2
∼

and the set of isomorphisms of ﬁelds F1 → F2 that map F1 onto F2 .
Next, let us assume that we have been given a hyperbolic curve [cf., e.g., [Mzk1],
§0, for a discussion of hyperbolic curves] over F . Let Σ be a nonempty set of prime
numbers. Write
ΔX
for the maximal pro-Σ quotient of the geometric fundamental group π1 (X ×F F ) of
X [relative to some basepoint]. Here, we note in passing that Σ may be recovered
from ΔX as the set of prime numbers that occur as factors of orders of ﬁnite
quotients of ΔX . Thus, one has a natural outer action
GF → Out(ΔX )
of GF on ΔX .
Lemma 2.2.

(Slimness) ΔX is slim.

Proof. This follows immediately by considering Galois actions on abelianizations
of open subgroups of ΔX — cf. the proof of [Mzk1], Lemma 1.3.1, in the case
where Σ is the set of all prime numbers. Another [earlier] approach to proving the
slimness of ΔX is given in [Naka], Corollary 1.3.4.

8

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

Deﬁnition 2.3. We shall say that the [not necessarily solvably closed!] extension
F/F , or, alternatively, the Galois group QF , is Σ-compatible with X if the natural
outer action
GF → Out(ΔX )
factors through the quotient GF  QF . Thus, if QF is Σ-compatible with X, then
one obtains an exact sequence of proﬁnite groups
1 → ΔX → Π X → Q F → 1
by pulling back the natural exact sequence
1 → ΔX → Aut(ΔX ) → Out(ΔX ) → 1
[which is exact by Lemma 2.2!] via the resulting homomorphism QF → Out(ΔX ).
Here, we note that since [it is an easily veriﬁed tautology that] the étale fundamental
group π1 (X) of X may be recovered as the result of pulling back this natural exact
sequence via the homomorphism GF → Out(ΔX ), it thus follows that ΠX may be
thought of as a quotient of π1 (X).
Proposition 2.4. (Geometric Subgroups are Characteristic) For i = 1, 2,
def
let Fi /Fi be a solvably closed extension of a number ﬁeld Fi ; Qi = Gal(Fi /Fi );
Σi a nonempty set of prime numbers; Xi a hyperbolic curve over Fi with which
Qi is Σi -compatible; 1 → ΔXi → ΠXi → Qi → 1 the resulting exact sequence
of proﬁnite groups [cf. Deﬁnition 2.3]. Then any isomorphism of topological
groups
∼
ΠX1 → ΠX2
maps ΔX1 isomorphically onto ΔX2 . In particular, Σ1 = Σ2 .
Proof. We give two proofs of Proposition 2.4. The ﬁrst proof consists of simply
observing [cf. the proof of [Mzk1], Lemma 1.1.4, (i), via [Mzk1], Theorem 1.1.2]
∼
that the image of ΔX1 under the composite of the isomorphism ΠX1 → ΠX2 with
the surjection ΠX2  Q2 forms a topologically ﬁnitely generated closed normal
subgroup of Q2 , hence is trivial, by Theorem 1.5.
The second proof of Proposition 2.4 only uses Theorem 1.5 in the well-known
case of an absolute Galois group of a number ﬁeld. Moreover, when either Σ1 or Σ2
is not equal to the set of all prime numbers, then this second proof does not use
Theorem 1.5 at all.
For i = 1, 2, let Hi ⊆ ΠXi be corresponding [i.e., relative to the given iso∼
morphism ΠX1 → ΠX2 ] normal open subgroups; write Hi  Ji for the quotients
determined by the quotients ΠXi  Qi . By taking the Hi to be suﬃciently small,
we may also assume that the number ﬁelds determined by the Ji contain square
roots of −1. Thus, by Proposition 1.2, (i), it follows that
cdp (Hi ) = 2 + d(p, i)

GLOBAL SOLVABLY CLOSED ANABELIAN GEOMETRY

9

where d(p, i) is equal to 1 or 2 [depending on whether Xi is aﬃne or proper] if p ∈ Σi
∼
and d(p, i) = 0 if p ∈
/ Σi . Since H1 → H2 , we thus conclude that Σ1 = Σ2 , and that
X1 is aﬃne if and only if X2 is. Now if Σ1 = Σ2 is the set of all prime numbers,
and X1 , X2 are aﬃne, then it follows from Matsumoto’s injectivity theorem [cf.
[Mtmo], Theorem 2.1] that the ﬁeld Fi is an algebraic closure of Fi ; thus, in this
case, Proposition 2.4 follows from [Mzk1], Lemma 1.1.4, (i) [i.e., Theorem 1.5 for
absolute Galois groups of number ﬁelds].
Next, let us suppose that there exists a prime number p such that p ∈
/ Σ1 ,
def
p ∈
/ Σ2 . This implies that every ﬁnite quotient group of Di = Ker(Hi  Ji )
has order prime to p, hence [by consideration of the Leray-Serre spectral sequence
associated to the surjection Hi  Ji ] that, for i = 1, 2, the natural homomorphism
H 2 (Ji , Fp ) → H 2 (Hi , Fp )
is an isomorphism. In particular, it follows that ΔXi acts trivially on H 2 (Hi , Fp ).
Thus, the natural action of ΠXi on H 2 (Hi , Fp ) factors through the quotient ΠXi 
Qi /Ji . Now, by taking Hi to be suﬃciently small, we may assume [since Qi is solvably closed!] that the extension ﬁeld of Fi determined by Ji contains a primitive
p-th root of unity. Thus, by Proposition 1.2, (ii), we conclude that the action of
∼
Qi /Ji on H 2 (Hi , Fp ) is faithful. Since the isomorphism ΠX1 → ΠX2 induces an
∼
∼
isomorphism H1 → H2 , hence an isomorphism H 2 (H1 , Fp ) → H 2 (H2 , Fp ) which
is compatible with the respective actions of ΠX1 , ΠX2 , we thus conclude that the
∼
isomorphism ΠX1 → ΠX2 preserves the kernels of the surjections ΠXi  Qi /Ji ,
hence that the subgroup ΔXi = Ker(ΠXi  Qi ) may be recovered as the intersection of the kernels of the surjections ΠXi  Qi /Ji , by letting the Hi range over
all suﬃciently small normal open subgroups of ΠXi . This completes the proof of
Proposition 2.4 in the case where there exists a prime number p such that p ∈
/ Σ1 ,
p∈
/ Σ2 .
Finally, we consider the case where X1 , X2 are proper. Let p be a prime
number; suppose that the Hi have been taken to be suﬃciently small so that the
number ﬁelds determined by the Ji contain a primitive p-th root of unity and a
square root of −1 [which, by Proposition 1.2, (i), implies that cdp (Ji ) = 2]. Since
def

Di = Ker(Hi  Ji ) also satisﬁes cdp (Di ) ≤ 2, it thus follows from the Leray-Serre
spectral sequence associated to the extension 1 → Di → Hi → Ji → 1 that there is
a natural isomorphism
H 4 (Hi , Fp ) ∼
= H 2 (Ji , Fp ) ⊗ H 2 (Di , Fp )
which is compatible with the natural action of ΠXi on the various cohomology modules involved. Here, we note that [by the well-known structure of the cohomology
of the geometric fundamental group of an algebraic curve] ΔXi ⊆ ΠXi acts trivially on H 2 (Di , Fp ). Thus, Proposition 2.4 follows in the present case by applying
Proposition 1.2, (ii), as in the argument given in the preceding paragraph.

Section 3: Some Examples
Finally, we conclude by observing that in various situations, Σ-compatible solvably closed extensions which are, moreover, “relatively small” [e.g., by comparison
to the entire absolute Galois group of a number ﬁeld] exist in substantial abundance.

Proposition 3.1.
(The Case of a Single Prime Number) Let Σ = {r},
where r is a prime number.
(i) Let Δ be a topologically ﬁnitely generated pro-r group. [Thus, since
Δ is topologically ﬁnitely generated, its topology admits a base of characteristic
open subgroups, which determine a natural proﬁnite topology on Out(Δ).] Write
Δ  Δab for the abelianization of Δ. Then the kernel of the natural morphism
of proﬁnite groups
Out(Δ) → Aut(Δab ⊗ Fr )
is a pro-r [hence, in particular, pro-solvable!] group.
(ii) Let X be a hyperbolic curve over F . Then there exists a ﬁnite Galois extension F1 over F such that the maximal solvable extension [which is
def
solvably closed — cf. Remark 1.1.2] F = F sol of F1 is Σ-compatible with X.
1

Proof. First, we consider assertion (i). Since Δ admits a base of characteristic
open subgroups, it suﬃces to verify assertion (i) when Δ is a ﬁnite group of order a

GLOBAL SOLVABLY CLOSED ANABELIAN GEOMETRY

11

power of r. But then consideration of the [manifestly characteristic!] lower central
series of Δ reveals that any automorphism α of Δ that induces the identity on
Δab ⊗ Fr is “unipotent upper triangular” with respect to the ﬁltration given by the
lower central series; thus, the order of α is a power of r. This completes the proof of
assertion (i). Assertion (ii) follows formally from assertion (i) and the deﬁnitions.

Proposition 3.2.
(Basic Properties of Special Linear Groups) Let l be
a prime number. Write SL2 (Fl ) for the special linear group of 2 by 2 matrices
def
with coeﬃcients in Fl , P SL2 (Fl ) = SL2 (Fl )/{±1}.
(i) Suppose that l ≥ 5. Then P SL2 (Fl ) is a simple ﬁnite group.
(ii) No proper subgroup of SL2 (Fl ) surjects onto P SL2 (Fl ).
(iii) P SL2 (F2 ), P SL2 (F3 ), as well as every proper subgroup of P SL2 (Fl ) [for
arbitrary l], is either solvable or isomorphic to P SL2 (F5 ).
Proof. Assertions (i), (ii), (iii) are well-known — cf., e.g., [Serre], Chapter IV,
§3.4, Lemmas 1, 2; [Carter], §1.2.
Remark 3.2.1. The proper subgroups H of SL2 (Fl ) may be analyzed as follows:
If H is of order divisible by l, then H contains a subgroup U of order l. Since F×
l ,

Fl2 are of order prime to l, such a subgroup U is generated by a unipotent matrix;
thus, [by possibly replacing
  H with a conjugate of H] we may assume that U is
generated by a matrix 10 11 . In particular, [as is well-known or easily computed]
the normalizer of U is given by the solvable subgroup of upper triangular matrices

H is proper. That is to say, since H is proper, we conclude that H is solvable,
as desired. On the other hand, if the order of H is prime to l, then H may be
classiﬁed by applying the Hurwitz formula to the tamely ramiﬁed Galois covering
P1F → P1F /H [arising from the natural action of SL2 on P1F , where Fl is an algebraic

closure of Fl ], which gives rise to fairly restrictive conditions on the ramiﬁcation
indices of this covering. In particular, if H is non-abelian, then, by taking an
appropriate isomorphism of P1F /H with P1F , one concludes that this covering is
l

ramiﬁed over the three points “0”, “1”, and “∞” of P1F , with ramiﬁcation index

(respectively, arbitrary, ≥ 2) at “∞” if the ramiﬁcation index at “1” is equal to 3
(respectively, 2). Now it is an elementary exercise to classify the possible groups H
that may occur. For instance, by considering modular curves, it follows immediately
that the case H = P SL2 (F5 ) corresponds to the case where the ramiﬁcation indices
are (2, 3, 5).

number ﬁeld F . Suppose further that F contains an l-th root of unity, and
that the resulting homomorphism
GF → SL2 (Fl )
determined by the action of the absolute Galois group GF of F on the l-torsion
points of the elliptic curve E compactifying X is surjective. Then there exists a
solvably closed extension F/F which is Σ-compatible with X, and, moreover,
linearly disjoint [over F ] from the extension K of F determined by the kernel of
the homomorphism GF → SL2 (Fl ).
Proof. Write L ⊆ K for the extension of F determined by the kernel of the homomorphism GF → P SL2 (Fl ) [obtained by composing the homomorphism GF →
SL2 (Fl ) with the natural surjection SL2 (Fl )  P SL2 (Fl )]. Then it follows immediately from Proposition 3.2, (ii), that any Galois extension of F is linearly
disjoint from K if and only if it is linearly disjoint from L. Now observe that
Gal(L/F ) ∼
= P SL2 (Fl ) is simple [cf. Proposition 3.2, (i)] and non-abelian. Thus,
by Proposition 3.1, (i), it suﬃces to show that the ﬁnite Galois extension R of F
determined by the kernel of the homomorphism GF → GL2 (Fr ) arising from the
Galois action on the r-torsion points of E is linearly disjoint from L. On the other
hand, again since Gal(L/F ) is simple and non-abelian, this linear disjointness property follows from the fact [cf. Proposition 3.2, (iii); our assumption that r = l > 5]
that no subquotient of GL2 (Fr ) [or, equivalently, P SL2 (Fr ), since P SL2 (Fl ) is
simple and nonabelian] is isomorphic to P SL2 (Fl ). This completes the proof of
Proposition 3.3.
Proposition 3.4.

elliptic curve over a number ﬁeld F with stable reduction over the ring of

unity. Suppose further that l ≥ [F : Q] + 2; that [Fμ : F ] divides (l − 1)/2 [which
implies that the homomorphism

def

determined by the action of the absolute Galois group GF of F on the l-torsion
points of the elliptic curve E compactifying X factors through the image of P SL2 (Fl )
in P GL2 (Fl )]; that the resulting homomorphism GF → P SL2 (Fl ) is surjective;
and that, for each prime l of F lying over l at which E has bad reduction, the
following condition is satisﬁed:
Write Fl for the completion of F at l. Thus, the elliptic curve E ×F Fl is
a Tate curve, hence has a well-deﬁned “q-parameter” ql in the ring of
integers OFl . Then the valuation of ql is prime to l.
Then:

(i) There exists an extension F/F which is Σ-compatible with X, and, moreover, linearly disjoint [over F ] from the extension K of F determined by the
kernel of the homomorphism GF → P SL2 (Fl ).
(ii) Write Kμ for the extension of F determined by the kernel of the homomorphism GF → GL2 (Fl ) [arising from the Galois action on the l-torsion points of
def
E]. Thus, Fμ ⊆ Kμ ; write Fμ = Fμ · F for the composite extension [over F ]. Then
the maximal solvable extension Fμsol of Fμ forms a solvably closed extension of
Fμ which is Σ-compatible with X and, moreover, linearly disjoint over Fμ from
the extension Kμ of Fμ .
Proof. First, we consider assertion (i). Let F /F be the extension determined by
the kernel of the homomorphism GF → Out(ΔX ) [cf. Deﬁnition 2.3]. Let l be
a prime of F lying over l. Since P SL2 (Fl ) is simple [cf. Proposition 3.2, (i)], to
complete the proof of assertion (i), it suﬃces to show that the composite [i.e., over
F ] ﬁeld extension K · F is not equal to F. Thus, suppose that K · F = F. Since
l ∈
/ Σ, if E has good reduction at l, then it follows that F/F is unramiﬁed at l;
similarly, if E has bad reduction at l, then the fact that l ∈ Σ implies that F/F is
tamely ramiﬁed at l. On the other hand, if E has good reduction at l, then the fact
that K ⊆ K · F = F is unramiﬁed at l implies, by applying, for instance, results
of Raynaud on the “fully faithfulness of restriction to the generic ﬁber” for ﬁnite
ﬂat group schemes over moderately ramiﬁed discrete valuation rings [cf. [Rayn],
Corollaire 3.3.6, (1); our assumption that l ≥ [F : Q] + 2, which implies that the
ring of integers OFl is indeed “moderately ramiﬁed”], that, if we write E for the
stable model of the elliptic curve E over OFl and E[l] for the kernel of multiplication
by l on E, then E[l] may be written as a direct product
E[l] ∼
=G×G
of two copies of some ﬁnite ﬂat group scheme G over OFl [which implies, for instance, that the tangent space of E[l], hence also of E, is even-dimensional!] — a
contradiction. Finally, if E has bad reduction at l, then the fact that K ⊆ K · F = F
is tamely ramiﬁed at l contradicts our assumption concerning the “valuation of the
q-parameter” [which implies that K is wildly ramiﬁed at l]. This completes the
proof of assertion (i).
To verify assertion (ii), let us ﬁrst observe that by Proposition 3.2, (i) [cf. our
assumption that l > 5], (ii), and the surjectivity assumption in the statement of the
present Proposition 3.4, we have Gal(Kμ /Fμ ) ∼
= SL2 (Fl ). Now, by applying Proposition 3.2, (ii), as in the proof of Proposition 3.3, assertion (ii) follows immediately
from assertion (i), together with the simplicity [and non-solvability] of P SL2 (Fl ).
