ABSOLUTE
ANABELIAN
GEOMETRY

CANONICAL
CURVES”

There
are
a
few
notational
errors
in
the
statement
of
the
condition
(†M
)
of
Lemma
3.4,
which,
however,
do
not
aﬀect
the
proof
of
Lemma
3.4
in
any
substantive
way.
The
subquotient
“G2
(M
)”
(respectively,
“G−1
”)
should
have
been
denoted
“G−2
(M
)”
(respectively,
“G1
”).
The
subquotient
G−2
(M
)
(respectively,
G1
)
is
isomorphic
to
the
tensor
product
of
an
unramiﬁed
module
with
a
Tate
twist
Fp
(−2)
(respectively,
Fp
(1)).
That
is
to
say,
there
is
a
sign
error
in
the
Tate
twists
stated
in
(†M
).
Finally,
in
order
to
obtain
the
desired
dimensions
over
Fp
,
one
must
replace
the
cohomology
module
def
“M
=
H
1
(ΔX
log
,
Ad(VFp
))”
by
the
submodule
of
this
module
consisting
of
elements
whose
restriction
to
each
of
the
cuspidal
inertia
groups
of
ΔX
log
is
upper
triangular
with
respect
to
the
ﬁltration
determined
by
the
nilpotent
monodromy
action
on
VFp
[i.e.,
by
the
cuspidal
inertia
group
in
question].
That
is
to
say,
an
elementary
computation
shows
that
the
operation
of
restriction
to
this
submodule
has
the
eﬀect
of
lowering
the
dimension
of
G−2
(M
)
from
3g
−
3
+
2r
to
3g
−
3
+
r,
as
desired.
