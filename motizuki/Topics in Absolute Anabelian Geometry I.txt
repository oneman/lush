TOPICS IN ABSOLUTE ANABELIAN GEOMETRY I:
GENERALITIES

March 2012
Abstract. This paper forms the ﬁrst part of a three-part series in which we treat
various topics in absolute anabelian geometry from the point of view of developing abstract algorithms, or “software”, that may be applied to abstract proﬁnite
groups that “just happen” to arise as [quotients of] étale fundamental groups from
algebraic geometry. One central theme of the present paper is the issue of understanding the gap between relative, “semi-absolute”, and absolute anabelian
geometry. We begin by studying various abstract combinatorial properties of proﬁnite groups that typically arise as absolute Galois groups or arithmetic/geometric
fundamental groups in the anabelian geometry of quite general varieties in arbitrary
dimension over number ﬁelds, mixed-characteristic local ﬁelds, or ﬁnite ﬁelds. These
considerations, combined with the classical theory of Albanese varieties, allow us
to derive an absolute anabelian algorithm for constructing the quotient of an
arithmetic fundamental group determined by the absolute Galois group of the
base ﬁeld in the case of quite general varieties of arbitrary dimension. Next, we
take a more detailed look at certain p-adic Hodge-theoretic aspects of the absolute
Galois groups of mixed-characteristic local ﬁelds. This allows us, for instance, to
derive, from a certain result communicated orally to the author by A. Tamagawa, a
“semi-absolute” Hom-version — whose absolute analogue is false! — of the anabelian conjecture for hyperbolic curves over mixed-characteristic local ﬁelds.
Finally, we generalize to the case of varieties of arbitrary dimension over arbitrary
sub-p-adic ﬁelds certain techniques developed by the author in previous papers over
mixed-characteristic local ﬁelds for applying relative anabelian results to obtain
“semi-absolute” group-theoretic contructions of the étale fundamental group
of one hyperbolic curve from the étale fundamental group of another closely related
hyperbolic curve.

Introduction
The present paper is the ﬁrst in a series of three papers, in which we continue our study of absolute anabelian geometry in the style of the following papers:
[Mzk6], [Mzk7], [Mzk8], [Mzk9], [Mzk10], [Mzk11], [Mzk13]. If X is a [geometrically
def

integral] variety over a ﬁeld k, and ΠX = π1 (X) is the étale fundamental group of
X [for some choice of basepoint], then roughly speaking, “anabelian geometry”
may be summarized as the study of the extent to which properties of X — such
as, for instance, the isomorphism class of X — may be “recovered” from [various
quotients of] the proﬁnite group ΠX . One form of anabelian geometry is “relative
anabelian geometry” [cf., e.g., [Mzk3]], in which instead of starting from [various quotients of] the proﬁnite group ΠX , one starts from the proﬁnite group ΠX
equipped with the natural augmentation ΠX  Gk to the absolute Galois group of
k. By contrast, “absolute anabelian geometry” refers to the study of properties of X as reﬂected solely in the proﬁnite group ΠX . Moreover, one may consider
various “intermediate variants” between relative and absolute anabelian geometry
such as, for instance, “semi-absolute anabelian geometry”, which refers to the
situation in which one starts from the proﬁnite group ΠX equipped with the kernel
of the natural augmentation ΠX  Gk .
The new point of view that underlies the various “topics in absolute anabelian
geometry” treated in the present three-part series may be summarized as follows.
In the past, research in anabelian geometry typically centered around the establishment of “fully faithfulness” results — i.e., “Grothendieck Conjecture-type” results
— concerning some sort of “fundamental group functor X → ΠX ” from varieties
to proﬁnite groups. In particular, the term “group-theoretic” was typically used
to refer to properties preserved, for instance, by some isomorphism of proﬁnite
∼
groups ΠX → ΠY [i.e., between the étale fundamental groups of varieties X, Y ].
By contrast:
In the present series, the focus of our attention is on the development of
“algorithms” — i.e., “software” — which are “group-theoretic” in the
sense that they are phrased in language that only depends on the structure
of the input data as [for instance] a proﬁnite group.
Here, the “input data” is a proﬁnite group that “just happens to arise” from scheme
theory as an étale fundamental group, but which is only of concern to us in its
capacity as an abstract proﬁnite group. That is to say,
the algorithms in question allow one to construct various objects reminiscent of objects that arise in scheme theory, but the issue of “eventually
returning to scheme theory” — e.g., of showing that some isomorphism of proﬁnite groups arises from an isomorphism of schemes — is no
longer an issue of primary interest.
One aspect of this new point of view is that the main results obtained are no longer
necessarily of the form

(∗) “some scheme is anabelian” — i.e., some sort of “fundamental group
functor X → ΠX ” from varieties to proﬁnite groups is fully faithful —
but rather of the form
(†) “some a priori scheme-theoretic property/construction/operation
may be formulated as a group-theoretic algorithm”, i.e., an algorithm
that depends only on the topological group structure of the arithmetic fundamental groups involved
— cf., e.g., (2), (4) below. A sort of intermediate variant between (∗) and (†) is
constituted by results of the form
(∗ ) “homomorphisms between arithmetic fundamental groups that satisfy
some sort of relatively mild condition arise from scheme theory”
— cf., e.g., (3) below.
Here, we note that typically results in absolute or semi-absolute anabelian
geometry are much more diﬃcult to obtain than corresponding results in relative
anabelian geometry [cf., e.g., the discussion of (i) below]. This is one reason why
one is frequently obliged to content oneself with results of the form (†) or (∗ ), as
opposed to (∗).
On the other hand, another aspect of this new point of view is that, by abolishing the restriction that one must have as one’s ultimate goal the complete reconstruction of the original schemes involved, one gains a greater degree of freedom
in the geometries that one considers. This greater degree of freedom often results in
the discovery of new results that might have eluded one’s attention if one restricts
oneself to obtaining results of the form (∗). Indeed, this phenomenon may already
be seen in previous work of the author:
(i) In [Mzk6], Proposition 1.2.1 [and its proof], various group-theoretic algorithms are given for constructing various objects associated to the absolute Galois group of a mixed-characteristic local ﬁeld. In this case, we
recall that it is well-known [cf., e.g., [NSW], the Closing Remark preceding
Theorem 12.2.7] that in general, there exist isomorphisms between such
absolute Galois groups that do not arise from scheme theory.
(ii) In the theory of pro-l cuspidalizations given in [Mzk13], §3, “cuspidalized geometrically pro-l fundamental groups” are “group-theoretically
constructed” from geometrically pro-l fundamental groups of proper hyperbolic curves without ever addressing the issue of whether or not the
original curve [i.e., scheme] may be reconstructed from the given geometrically pro-l fundamental group [of a proper hyperbolic curve].
(iii) In some sense, the abstract, algorithmic point of view discussed above
is taken even further in [Mzk12], where one works with certain types of
purely combinatorial objects — i.e., “semi-graphs of anabelioids” — whose
deﬁnition “just happens to be” motivated by stable curves in algebraic geometry. On the other hand, the results obtained in [Mzk12] are results

concerning the abstract combinatorial geometry of these abstract combinatorial objects — i.e., one is never concerned with the issue of “eventually
returning” to, for instance, scheme-theoretic morphisms.
The main results of the present paper are, to a substantial extent, “generalities”
that will be of use to us in the further development of the theory in the latter
two papers of the present three-part series. These main results center around the
theme of understanding the gap between relative, semi-absolute, and absolute
anabelian geometry and may be summarized as follows:
(1) In §1, we study various notions associated to abstract proﬁnite groups
such as RTF-quotients [i.e., quotients obtained by successive formation
of torsion-free abelianizations — cf. Deﬁnition 1.1, (i)], slimness [i.e.,
the property that all open subgroups are center-free], and elasticity [i.e.,
the property that every nontrivial topologically ﬁnitely generated closed
normal subgroup of an open subgroup is itself open — cf. Deﬁnition 1.1,
(ii)] in the context of the absolute Galois groups that typically appear
in anabelian geometry [cf. Proposition 1.5, Theorem 1.7].
(2) In §2, we begin by formulating the terminology that we shall use in our
discussion of the anabelian geometry of quite general varieties of arbitrary
dimension [cf. Deﬁnition 2.1]. We then apply the theory of slimness and
elasticity developed in §1 to study various variants of the notion of “semiabsoluteness” [cf. Proposition 2.5]. Moreover, in the case of quite general
varieties of arbitrary dimension over number ﬁelds, mixed-characteristic
local ﬁelds, or ﬁnite ﬁelds, we combine the various group-theoretic considerations of (1) with the classical theory of Albanese varieties [reviewed in
the Appendix] to give various
“group-theoretic algorithms” for constructing the quotient of an
arithmetic fundamental group determined by the absolute
Galois group of the base ﬁeld [cf. Theorem 2.6, Corollary 2.8].
Finally, in the case of hyperbolic orbicurves, we apply the theory of maximal pro-RTF-quotients developed in §1 to give quite explicit “grouptheoretic algorithms” for constructing these quotients [cf. Theorem 2.11].
Such maximal pro-RTF-quotients may be thought of as a sort of analogue,
in the case of mixed-characteristic local ﬁelds, of the reconstruction, in the
case of ﬁnite ﬁelds, of the quotient of an arithmetic fundamental group
determined by the absolute Galois group of the base ﬁeld via the operation of “passing to the maximal torsion-free abelian quotient” [cf. Remark
2.11.1].
(3) In §3, we develop a generalization of the main result of [Mzk1] concerning
the geometricity of arbitrary isomorphisms of absolute Galois groups of mixed-characteristic local ﬁelds that preserve the ramiﬁcation ﬁltration [cf. Theorem 3.5].
This generalization allows one to replace the condition of “preserving
the ramiﬁcation ﬁltration” by various more general conditions, certain

TOPICS IN ABSOLUTE ANABELIAN GEOMETRY I

of which were motivated by a result orally communicated to the author
by A. Tamagawa [cf. Remark 3.8.1]. Moreover, unlike the main result of
[Mzk1], this generalization may be applied, in certain cases, to
arbitrary open homomorphisms — i.e., not just isomorphisms! —
between absolute Galois groups of mixed-characteristic local ﬁelds, hence
implies certain semi-absolute Hom-versions [cf. Corollary 3.8, 3.9] of the
relative Hom-versions of the Grothendieck Conjecture given in [Mzk3],
Theorems A, B. Also, we observe, in Example 2.13, that the corresponding
absolute Hom-version of these results is false in general. Indeed, it was
precisely the discovery of this counterexample to the “absolute Homversion” that led the author to the detailed investigation of the “gap between absolute and semi-absolute” that forms the content of §2.
(4) In §4, we study various “fundamental operations” for passing from one
algebraic stack to another. In the case of arbitrary dimension, these operations are the operations of “passing to a ﬁnite étale covering”
and “passing to a ﬁnite étale quotient”; in the case of hyperbolic
orbicurves, we also consider the operations of “forgetting a cusp” and
“coarsifying a non-scheme-like point”. Our main result asserts that
if one assumes certain relative anabelian results concerning
the varieties under consideration, then there exist group-theoretic
algorithms for describing the corresponding semi-absolute anabelian operations on arithmetic fundamental groups [cf. Theorem 4.7].
This theory, which generalizes the theory of [Mzk9], §2, and [Mzk13], §2,
may be applied not only to hyperbolic orbicurves over sub-p-adic ﬁelds [cf.
Example 4.8], but also to “iso-poly-hyperbolic orbisurfaces” over sub-padic ﬁelds [cf. Example 4.9]. In [Mzk15], this theory will be applied, in an
essential way, in our development of the theory of Belyi and elliptic cuspidalizations. We also give a tempered version of this theory [cf. Theorem
4.12].
Finally, in an Appendix, we review, for lack of an appropriate reference, various wellknown facts concerning the theory of Albanese varieties that will play an important
role in the portion of the theory of §2 concerning varieties of arbitrary dimension.
Much of this theory of Albanese varieties is contained in such classical references
as [NS], [Serre1], [Chev], which are written from a somewhat classical point of
view. Thus, in the Appendix, we give a modern scheme-theoretic treatment of this
classical theory, but without resorting to the introduction of motives and derived
categories, as in [BS], [SS]. In fact, strictly speaking, in the proofs that appear
in the body of the text [i.e., §2], we shall only make essential use of the portion
of the Appendix concerning abelian Albanese varieties [i.e., as opposed to semiabelian Albanese varieties]. Nevertheless, we decided to give a full treatment of
the theory of Albanese varieties as given in the Appendix, since it seemed to the
author that the theory is not much more diﬃcult and, moreover, assumes a much

6

more natural form when formulated for “open” [i.e., not necessarily proper] varieties
[which, roughly speaking, correspond to the case of semi-abelian Albanese varieties]
than when formulated only for proper varieties [which, roughly speaking, correspond
to the case of abelian Albanese varieties].

A ﬁnite ﬁeld extension of Q will be referred to as a number ﬁeld, or NF, for
short. A ﬁnite ﬁeld extension of Qp for some p ∈ Primes will be referred to as a
mixed-characteristic nonarchimedean local ﬁeld, or MLF, for short. A ﬁeld of ﬁnite
cardinality will be referred to as a ﬁnite ﬁeld, or FF, for short. We shall regard the
set of symbols {NF, MLF, FF} as being equipped with a linear ordering
NF > MLF > FF
and refer to an element of this set of symbols as a ﬁeld type.
Topological Groups:
Let G be a Hausdorﬀ topological group, and H ⊆ G a closed subgroup. Let us
write
def

ZG (H) = {g ∈ G | g · h = h · g, ∀ h ∈ H}
for the centralizer of H in G;
def

NG (H) = {g ∈ G | g · H · g −1 = H}
for the normalizer of H in G; and
def

CG (H) = {g ∈ G | (g · H · g −1 )



H has ﬁnite index in H, g · H · g −1 }

for the commensurator of H in G. Note that: (i) ZG (H), NG (H) and CG (H) are
subgroups of G; (ii) we have inclusions H, ZG (H) ⊆ NG (H) ⊆ CG (H); (iii) H is

8

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

normal in NG (H). If H = NG (H) (respectively, H = CG (H)), then we shall say
that H is normally terminal (respectively, commensurably terminal) in G. Note
that ZG (H), NG (H) are always closed in G, while CG (H) is not necessarily closed
def

in G. Also, we shall write Z(G) = ZG (G) for the center of G.
Let G be a topological group. Then [cf. [Mzk14], §0] we shall refer to a normal
open subgroup H ⊆ G such that the quotient group G/H is a free discrete group
as co-free. We shall refer to a co-free subgroup H ⊆ G as minimal if every co-free
subgroup of G contains H. Thus, any minimal co-free subgroup of G is necessarily
unique and characteristic.
We shall refer to a continuous homomorphism between topological groups as
dense (respectively, of DOF-type [cf. [Mzk10], Deﬁnition 6.2, (iii)]; of OF-type) if
its image is dense (respectively, dense in some open subgroup of ﬁnite index; an
open subgroup of ﬁnite index). Let Π be a topological group; Δ a normal closed
subgroup such that every characteristic open subgroup of ﬁnite index H ⊆ Δ admits
 for the proﬁnite completion of Π.
a minimal co-free subgroup H co-fr ⊆ H. Write Π
Let
 Q
Π
be a quotient of proﬁnite groups. Then we shall refer to as the (Q, Δ)-co-free
 ] Q
completion of Π, or co-free completion of Π with respect to [the quotient Π
and [the subgroup] Δ ⊆ Π — where we shall often omit mention of Δ when it is
ﬁxed throughout the discussion — the inverse limit

— where H ⊆ Δ ranges over the characteristic open subgroups of Δ of ﬁnite index;

 co-fr ⊆ Q is the image of
H
Q
 co-fr in Q; “ImQ (−)” denotes the image in Q/H
 co-fr of the group in parentheses.
H
Q
Thus, we have a natural dense homomorphism Π → ΠQ/co-fr .
We shall say that a proﬁnite group G is slim if for every open subgroup H ⊆ G,
the centralizer ZG (H) is trivial. Note that every ﬁnite normal closed subgroup
N ⊆ G of a slim proﬁnite group G is trivial. [Indeed,
 this follows by observing that
for any normal open subgroup H ⊆ G such that N H = {1}, consideration of the
inclusion N → G/H reveals that the conjugation action of H on N is trivial, i.e.,
that N ⊆ ZG (H) = {1}.]
We shall say that a proﬁnite group G is decomposable if there exists an iso∼
morphism of proﬁnite groups H1 × H2 → G, where H1 , H2 are nontrivial proﬁnite
groups. If a proﬁnite group G is not decomposable, then we shall say that it is
indecomposable.
We shall write Gab for the abelianization of a proﬁnite group G, i.e., the quotient of G by the closure of the commutator subgroup of G, and
Gab-t
for the torsion-free abelianization of G, i.e., the quotient of Gab by the closure of
the torsion subgroup of Gab . Note that the formation of Gab , Gab-t is functorial
with respect to arbitrary continuous homomorphisms of proﬁnite groups.

We shall denote the group of automorphisms of a proﬁnite group G by Aut(G).
Conjugation by elements of G determines a homomorphism G → Aut(G) whose
image consists of the inner automorphisms of G. We shall denote by Out(G)
the quotient of Aut(G) by the [normal] subgroup consisting of the inner automorphisms. In particular, if G is center-free, then we have an exact sequence
1 → G → Aut(G) → Out(G) → 1. If, moreover, G is topologically ﬁnitely generated,
then it follows immediately that the topology of G admits a basis of characteristic
open subgroups, which thus determine a topology on Aut(G), Out(G) with respect
to which the exact sequence 1 → G → Aut(G) → Out(G) → 1 may be regarded as
an exact sequence of proﬁnite groups.
Algebraic Stacks and Log Schemes:
We refer to [FC], Chapter I, §4.10, for a discussion of the coarse space associated
to an algebraic stack. We shall say that an algebraic stack is scheme-like if it is, in
fact, a scheme. We shall say that an algebraic stack is generically scheme-like if it
admits an open dense substack which is a scheme.
We refer to [Kato] and the references given in [Kato] for basic facts and definitions concerning log schemes. Here, we recall that the interior of a log scheme
refers to the largest open subscheme over which the log structure is trivial.
Curves:
We shall use the following terms, as they are deﬁned in [Mzk13], §0: hyperbolic
curve, family of hyperbolic curves, cusp, tripod. Also, we refer to [Mzk6], the proof
of Lemma 2.1; [Mzk6], the discussion following Lemma 2.1, for an explanation of
the terms “stable reduction” and “stable model” applied to a hyperbolic curve over
an MLF.
If X is a generically scheme-like algebraic stack over a ﬁeld k that admits a
ﬁnite étale Galois covering Y → X, where Y is a hyperbolic curve over a ﬁnite
extension of k, then we shall refer to X as a hyperbolic orbicurve over k. [Thus,
when k is of characteristic zero, this deﬁnition coincides with the deﬁnition of a
“hyperbolic orbicurve” in [Mzk13], §0, and diﬀers from, but is equivalent to, the
deﬁnition of a “hyperbolic orbicurve” given in [Mzk7], Deﬁnition 2.2, (ii). We refer
to [Mzk13], §0, for more on this equivalence.] Note that the notion of a “cusp of
a hyperbolic curve” given in [Mzk13], §0, generalizes immediately to the notion of
“cusp of a hyperbolic orbicurve”. If X → Y is a dominant morphism of hyperbolic
orbicurves, then we shall refer to X → Y as a partial coarsiﬁcation morphism if the
morphism induced by X → Y on associated coarse spaces is an isomorphism.
Let X be a hyperbolic orbicurve over an algebraically closed ﬁeld; denote its
étale fundamental group by ΔX . We shall refer to the order of the [manifestly ﬁnite!]
decomposition group in ΔX of a closed point x of X as the order of x. We shall
refer to the [manifestly ﬁnite!] least common multiple of the orders of the closed
points of X as the order of X. Thus, it follows immediately from the deﬁnitions
that X is a hyperbolic curve if and only if the order of X is equal to 1.

Section 1: Some Proﬁnite Group Theory
We begin by discussing certain aspects of abstract proﬁnite groups, as they
relate to the Galois groups of ﬁnite ﬁelds, mixed-characteristic nonarchimedean
local ﬁelds, and number ﬁelds. In the following, let G be a proﬁnite group.
Deﬁnition 1.1.
(i) In the following, “RTF” is to be understood as an abbreviation for “recursively torsion-free”. If H ⊆ G is a normal open subgroup that arises as the kernel
of a continuous surjection G  Q, where Q is a ﬁnite abelian group, that factors
through the torsion-free abelianization G  Gab-t of G [cf. §0], then we shall refer
to (G, H) as an RTF-pair. If for some integer n ≥ 1, a sequence of open subgroups
Gn ⊆ Gn−1 ⊆ . . . G1 ⊆ G0 = G
of G satisﬁes the condition that, for each nonnegative integer j ≤ n − 1, (Gj , Gj+1 )
is an RTF-pair, then we shall refer to this sequence of open subgroups as an RTFchain [from Gn to G]. If H ⊆ G is an open subgroup such that there exists an
RTF-chain from H to G, then we shall refer to H ⊆ G as an RTF-subgroup [of G].
If the kernel of a continuous surjection φ : G  Q, where Q is a ﬁnite group, is an
RTF-subgroup of G, then we shall say that φ : G  Q is an RTF-quotient of G.
If φ : G  Q is a continuous surjection of proﬁnite groups such that the topology
of Q admits a basis of normal open subgroups {Nα }α∈A satisfying the property
that each composite G  Q  Q/Nα [for α ∈ A] is an RTF-quotient, then we
shall say that φ : G  Q is a pro-RTF-quotient. If G is a proﬁnite group such
that the identity map of G forms a pro-RTF-quotient, then we shall say that G is
a pro-RTF-group. [Thus, every pro-RTF-group is pro-solvable.]
(ii) We shall say that G is elastic if it holds that every topologically ﬁnitely
generated closed normal subgroup N ⊆ H of an open subgroup H ⊆ G of G is
either trivial or of ﬁnite index in G. If G is elastic, but not topologically ﬁnitely
generated, then we shall say that G is very elastic.
(iii) Let Σ ⊆ Primes [cf. §0] be a set of prime numbers. If G admits an
open subgroup which is pro-Σ, then we shall say that G is almost pro-Σ. We
shall refer to a quotient G  Q as almost pro-Σ-maximal if for some normal open
subgroup N ⊆ G with maximal pro-Σ quotient N  P , we have Ker(G  Q) =
Ker(N  P ). [Thus, any almost pro-Σ-maximal quotient of G is almost pro-Σ.]
def

If Σ = Primes \ {p} for some p ∈ Primes, then we shall write “pro-(= p)” for
“pro-Σ”. Write
 (=p)
Z
 We shall say that G is pro-omissive (refor the maximal pro-(= p) quotient of Z.
spectively, almost pro-omissive) if it is pro-(= p) for some p ∈ Primes (respectively,
if it admits a pro-omissive open subgroup). We shall say that G is augmented pro-p
 (=p) → 1,
if there exists an exact sequence of proﬁnite groups 1 → N → G → Z
where N is pro-p; in this case, the image of N in G is uniquely determined [i.e., as the
 (=p) [which is well-deﬁned up to
maximal pro-p subgroup of G]; the quotient G  Z

TOPICS IN ABSOLUTE ANABELIAN GEOMETRY I

11

 (=p) ] will be referred to as the augmentation of the augmented
automorphisms of Z
pro-p group G. We shall say that G is augmented pro-prime if it is augmented prop for some [not necessarily unique!] p ∈ Primes. If Σ = {p} for some unspeciﬁed
p ∈ Primes, we shall write “pro-prime” for “pro-Σ”. If C is the “full formation”
[cf., e.g., [FJ], p. 343] of ﬁnite solvable Σ-groups, then we shall refer to a pro-C
group as a pro-Σ-solvable group.
Proposition 1.2.

(Basic Properties of Pro-RTF-quotients) Let
φ : G1 → G2

be a continuous homomorphism of proﬁnite groups. Then:
(i) If H ⊆ G2 is an RTF-subgroup of G2 , then φ−1 (H) ⊆ G1 is an RTFsubgroup of G1 .

(ii) If H, J ⊆ G are RTF-subgroups of G, then so is H J.
(iii) If H ⊆ G is an RTF-subgroup of G, then there exists a normal [open]
RTF-subgroup J ⊆ G of G such that J ⊆ H.
(iv) Every RTF-quotient G  Q of G factors through the quotient
def

G  GRTF = ←
lim
− G/N
N

— where N ranges over the normal [open] RTF-subgroups of G. We shall refer
to this quotient G  GRTF as the maximal pro-RTF-quotient. Finally, the
proﬁnite group GRTF is a pro-RTF-group.
(v) There exists a commutative diagram

Proof. Assertion (i) follows immediately from the deﬁnitions, together with the
functoriality of the torsion-free abelianization
[cf. §0]. To verify assertion (ii), one

observes that an RTF-chain
from H J to G may be obtained by concatenating

an RTF-chain from H J to J [whose existence follows from assertion (i) applied
to the natural inclusion homomorphism J → G] with an RTF-chain from J to
G. Assertion (iii) follows by applying assertion (ii) to some ﬁnite intersection of
conjugates of H. Assertion (iv) follows immediately from assertions (ii), (iii), and
the deﬁnitions involved. Assertion (v) follows immediately from assertions (i), (iv).

(i) Let H ⊆ G be an open subgroup of the proﬁnite group G. Then the elasticity of G implies that of H. If G is slim, then the elasticity of H implies that of
G.
(ii) Suppose that G is nontrivial. Then G is very elastic if and only if it
holds that every topologically ﬁnitely generated closed normal subgroup N ⊆ H of
an open subgroup H ⊆ G of G is trivial.
Proof. Assertion (i) follows immediately from the deﬁnitions, together with the
fact that a slim proﬁnite group has no normal closed ﬁnite subgroups [cf. §0]. The
necessity portion of assertion (ii) follows from the fact that the existence of a topologically ﬁnitely generated open subgroup of G implies that G itself is topologically
ﬁnitely generated; the suﬃciency portion of assertion (ii) follows immediately by
def

taking N = G = {1}.
Next, we consider Galois groups.
Deﬁnition 1.4.
We shall refer to a ﬁeld k as solvably closed if, for every ﬁnite
abelian ﬁeld extension k  of k, it holds that k  = k.
Remark 1.4.1. Note that if 
k is a solvably closed Galois extension of a ﬁeld k of
type MLF or FF [cf. §0], then 
k is an algebraic closure of k. Indeed, this follows
from the well-known fact that the absolute Galois group of a ﬁeld of type MLF or
FF is pro-solvable [cf., e.g., [NSW], Chapter VII, §5].
Proposition 1.5.

(Pro-RTF-quotients of MLF Galois Groups) Let k be an
def

algebraic closure of an MLF [cf. §0] k of residue characteristic p; Gk = Gal(k/k);
Gk  GRTF
the maximal pro-RTF-quotient [cf. Proposition 1.2, (iv)] of Gk .

(kH

[where the “∧” denotes the proﬁnite completion of an abelian group; “×” denotes
the group of units of a ring]; moreover, H ab ﬁts into an exact sequence

TOPICS IN ABSOLUTE ANABELIAN GEOMETRY I

[where OkH ⊆ kH is the ring of integers] in which the image of Ok×H in H ab coincides
with the image of the inertia subgroup of H. Observe, moreover, that the quotient
of the abelian proﬁnite group Ok×H by its torsion subgroup is a pro-p group. Thus,
assertion (ii) follows immediately from this observation, together with the deﬁnition
of the maximal pro-RTF-quotient. Next, let us observe that by applying the natural
∼
isomorphism (Ok×H ) ⊗ Qp → kH , it follows that whenever H is normal in Gk , the
action of Gk /H on H ab-t is faithful. Thus, assertion (i) follows immediately.
The following result is well-known.
Proposition 1.6.

(Maximal Pro-p Quotients of MLF Galois Groups) Let
def

k be an algebraic closure of an MLF k of residue characteristic p; Gk = Gal(k/k);
(p)
Gk  Gk the maximal pro-p-quotient of Gk . Then:
(i) Any almost pro-p-maximal quotient Gk  Q of Gk is slim.
(ii) Suppose further that k contains a primitive p-th root of unity. Then
(p)
for any ﬁnite module M annihilated by p equipped with a continuous action by Gk
[which thus determines a continuous action by Gk ], the natural homomorphism
(p)
Gk  Gk induces an isomorphism
∼

H j (Gk , M ) → H j (Gk , M )

on Galois cohomology modules for all integers j ≥ 0.
(iii) If k contains (respectively, does not contain) a primitive p-th root
of unity, then any closed subgroup of inﬁnite index (respectively, any closed
(p)
subgroup of arbitrary index) H ⊆ Gk is a free pro-p group.
Proof. Assertion (i) follows from the argument applied to verify Proposition 1.5,
(i). To verify assertion (ii), it suﬃces to show that the cohomology module
j
H j (J, M ) ∼

def

[where J = Ker(Gk  Gk ); k  ranges over the ﬁnite Galois extensions of k such
that [k  : k] is a power of p; Gk ⊆ Gk is the open subgroup determined by k  ]
vanishes for j ≥ 1. By “dévissage”, we may assume that M ∼
= Fp with the trivial
Gk -action. Since the cohomological dimension of Gk is equal to 2 [cf. [NSW],
Theorem 7.1.8, (i)], it suﬃces to consider the cases j = 1, 2. For j = 2, since
H 2 (Gk , Fp ) ∼
= Fp [cf. [NSW], Theorem 7.1.8, (ii); our hypothesis that k contains
a primitive p-th root of unity], it suﬃces, by the well-known functorial behavior of
H 2 (Gk , Fp ) [cf. [NSW], Corollary 7.1.4], to observe that k  always admits a cyclic
Galois extension of degree p [arising, for instance, from an extension of the residue
ﬁeld of k  ]. On the other hand, for j = 1, the desired vanishing is a tautology,
(p)
in light of the deﬁnition of the quotient Gk  Gk . This completes the proof of
assertion (ii).
(p)

Finally, we consider assertion (iii). If k does not contain a primitive p-th root
(p)
of unity, then Gk itself is a free pro-p group [cf. [NSW], Theorem 7.5.8, (i)], so
(p)
any closed subgroup H ⊆ Gk is also free pro-p [cf., e.g., [RZ], Corollary 7.7.5].
Thus, let us assume that k contains a primitive p-th root of unity, so we may
(p)
apply the isomorphism of assertion (ii). In particular, if J ⊆ Gk is an open
subgroup such that H ⊆ J, and kJ ⊆ k is the subﬁeld determined by J, then one
veriﬁes immediately that the quotient GkJ  J may be identiﬁed with the quotient
∼
(p)
GkJ  GkJ , so we obtain an isomorphism H 2 (J, Fp ) → H 2 (GkJ , Fp ) [where Fp is
equipped with the trivial Galois action]. Thus, to complete the proof that H is free
pro-p, it suﬃces [by a well-known cohomological criterion for free pro-p groups —
cf., e.g., [RZ], Theorem 7.7.4] to show that the cohomology module
2
H 2 (H, Fp ) ∼
= lim
−→ H (GkJ , Fp )
kJ

[where Fp is equipped with the trivial Galois action; kJ ranges over the ﬁnite
(p)
extensions of k arising from open subgroups J ⊆ Gk such that H ⊆ J] vanishes.
As in the proof of assertion (ii), this vanishing follows from the well-known functorial
behavior of H 2 (GkJ , Fp ), together with the observation that, by our assumption that
(p)
H is of inﬁnite index in Gk , kJ always admits an extension of degree p arising
(p)
from an open subgroup of J [where J ⊆ Gk corresponds to kJ ] containing H.

Let k be a solvably closed Galois extension of a ﬁeld k; write Gk = Gal(
Then:
 is neither elastic nor slim.
(i) If k is an FF, then Gk ∼

(ii) If k is an MLF of residue characteristic p, then Gk , as well as any
almost pro-p-maximal quotient Gk  Q of Gk , is elastic and slim.
(iii) If k is an NF, then Gk is very elastic and slim.
Proof. Assertion (i) is immediate from the deﬁnitions; assertion (iii) is the content
of [Mzk11], Corollary 2.2; [Mzk11], Theorem 2.4. The slimness portion of assertion
(ii) for Gk is shown, for instance, in [Mzk6], Theorem 1.1.1, (ii) [via the same
argument as the argument applied to prove Proposition 1.5, (i); Proposition 1.6,
(i)]; the slimness portion of assertion (ii) for Q is precisely the content of Proposition
1.6, (i). Write p for the residue characteristic of k.
To show the elasticity portion of assertion (ii) for Q, let N ⊆ H be a closed
normal subgroup of inﬁnite index of an open subgroup H ⊆ Q such that N is
topologically generated by r elements, where r ≥ 1 is an integer. Then it suﬃces
to show that N is trivial. Since Q has already been shown to be slim [hence has
no nontrivial ﬁnite normal closed subgroups — cf. §0], we may always replace k
by a ﬁnite extension of k. In particular, we may assume that H = Q, and that
Q is maximal pro-p. Since [Q : N ] is inﬁnite, it follows that there exists an open
subgroup J ⊆ Q, corresponding to a subﬁeld kJ ⊆ k, such that N ⊆ J, and

TOPICS IN ABSOLUTE ANABELIAN GEOMETRY I

15

[kJ : Qp ] ≥ r + 1. Here, we recall from our discussion of local class ﬁeld theory in
the proof of Proposition 1.5 that dimQp (J ab ⊗ Qp ) = [kJ : Qp ] + 1 (≥ r + 2). In
particular, we conclude that N is necessarily a subgroup of inﬁnite index of some
topologically ﬁnitely generated closed subgroup P ⊆ J such that [J : P ] is inﬁnite.
[For instance, one may take P to be the subgroup of J topologically generated by
N , together with an element of J that maps to a non-torsion element of the quotient
of J ab by the image of N ab .] Thus, we conclude from Proposition 1.6, (iii), that P
is a free pro-p group which contains a topologically ﬁnitely generated closed normal
subgroup N ⊆ P of inﬁnite index. On the other hand, by [a rather easy special
case of] the theorem of Lubotzky-Melnikov-van den Dries [cf., e.g., [FJ], Proposition
24.10.3; [MT], Theorem 1.5], this implies that N is trivial. This completes the proof
of the elasticity portion of assertion (ii) for Q.
To show the elasticity portion of assertion (ii) for Gk , let N ⊆ H be a closed
normal subgroup of inﬁnite index of an open subgroup H ⊆ Gk such that N is
topologically generated by r elements, where r ≥ 1 is an integer. Then it suﬃces
to show that N is trivial. As in the proof of the elasticity of “Q”, we may assume
that H = Gk ; also, since [Gk : N ] is inﬁnite, by passing to a ﬁnite extension of
k corresponding to an open subgroup of Gk containing N , we may assume that
[k : Qp ] ≥ r. But this implies that the image of N in Gab
k ⊗ Zp [which is of rank
[k : Qp ] + 1 ≥ r + 1] is of inﬁnite index, hence that the image of N in any almost
pro-p-maximal quotient Gk  Q is of inﬁnite index. Thus, by the elasticity of “Q”,
we conclude that such images are trivial. Since, moreover, the natural surjection
Gk  lim
←− Q
Q

[where Q ranges over the almost pro-p-maximal quotients of Gk ] is [by the deﬁnition
of the term “almost pro-p-maximal quotient”] an isomorphism, this is enough to
conclude that N is trivial, as desired.

Section 2: Semi-absolute Anabelian Geometry
In the present §2, we consider the problem of characterizing “group-theoretically”
the quotient morphism to the Galois group of the base ﬁeld of the arithmetic fundamental group of a variety. In particular, the theory of the present §2 reﬁnes the
theory of [Mzk6], Lemma 1.1.4, in two respects: We extend this theory to the case of
quite general varieties of arbitrary dimension [cf. Corollary 2.8], and, in the case of
hyperbolic orbicurves, we give a “group-theoretic version” of the numerical criterion
of [Mzk6], Lemma 1.1.4, via the theory of maximal pro-RTF-quotients developed in
§1 [cf. Corollary 2.12]. The theory of the present §2 depends on the general theory
of Albanese varieties, which we review in the Appendix, for the convenience of the
reader.
Suppose that:
(1) k is a perfect ﬁeld, k an algebraic closure of k, 
k ⊆ k a solvably closed
def
k/k).
Galois extension of k, and Gk = Gal(
(2) X → Spec(k) is a geometrically connected, smooth, separated algebraic
stack of ﬁnite type over k.
(3) Y → X is a connected ﬁnite étale Galois covering which is a [necessarily
separated, smooth, and of ﬁnite type over k] k-scheme such that Gal(Y /X)
acts freely on some nonempty open subscheme of Y [so X is generically
scheme-like — cf. §0].
(4) Y → Y is an open immersion into a connected proper k-scheme Y such
log
that Y is the underlying scheme of a log scheme Y
that is log smooth over
k [where we regard Spec(k) as equipped with the trivial log structure], and
the image of Y in Y coincides with the interior [cf. §0] of the log scheme
log
Y .
Thus, it follows from the log purity theorem [which is exposed, for instance, in
[Mzk4] as “Theorem B”] that the condition that a ﬁnite étale covering Z → Y
be tamely ramiﬁed over the height one primes of Y is equivalent to the condition
log
log
that the normalization Z of Y in Z determine a log étale morphism Z
→Y
[whose underlying morphism of schemes is Z → Y ]; in particular, one concludes
immediately that the condition that Z → Y be tamely ramiﬁed over the height
one primes of Y is independent of the choice of “log smooth log compactiﬁcation”
log
Y
for Y . Thus, one veriﬁes immediately [by considering the various Gal(Y /X)log
conjugates of the “log compactiﬁcation” Y ] that the ﬁnite étale coverings of X
whose pull-backs to Y are tamely ramiﬁed over [the height one primes of] Y form a
Galois category, whose associated proﬁnite group [relative to an appropriate choice
of basepoint for X] we denote by π1tame (X, Y ), or simply
π1tame (X)
when Y → X is ﬁxed. In particular, if we use the subscript “k” to denote basechange from k to k, then by choosing a connected component of Y k , we obtain

a subgroup π1tame (Xk ) ⊆ π1tame (X) which ﬁts into a natural exact sequence 1 →
π1tame (Xk ) → π1tame (X) → Gal(k/k) → 1.
Next, let Σ ⊆ Primes be a set of prime numbers; π1tame (Xk )  ΔX an almost pro-Σ-maximal quotient of π1tame (Xk ) whose kernel is normal in π1tame (X),
hence determines a quotient π1tame (X)  ΠX ; we also assume that the quotient
π1tame (X)  Gal(Y /X) admits a factorization π1tame (X)  ΠX  Gal(Y /X),
and that the kernel of the resulting homomorphism ΔX → Gal(Y /X) is pro-Σ.
Thus, Ker(ΔX → Gal(Y /X)) may be identiﬁed with the maximal pro-Σ quotient
of Ker(π1tame (Xk ) → Gal(Y /X)); we obtain a natural exact sequence
1 → ΔX → ΠX → Gal(k/k) → 1
— which may be thought of as an extension of the proﬁnite group Gal(k/k).
Deﬁnition 2.1.
(i) We shall refer to any proﬁnite group Δ which is isomorphic to the proﬁnite
group ΔX constructed in the above discussion for some choice of data (k, X, Y →

π1tame (Xk )  ΔX with an isomorphism ΔX → Δ as a scheme-theoretic envelope

Δ. [Thus, given a proﬁnite group of GFG-type, there are, in general, many possible
choices of construction data for the proﬁnite group.]
(ii) We shall refer to any extension 1 → Δ → Π → G → 1 of proﬁnite groups
which is isomorphic to the extension 1 → ΔX → ΠX → Gal(k/k) → 1 constructed

refer to (k, X, Y → Y , Σ) as a collection of construction data for this extension.
[Thus, given an extension of AFG-type, there are, in general, many possible choices
of construction data for the extension.]
(iii) Let 1 → Δ∗ → Π∗ → G∗ → 1 be an extension of AFG-type; N ⊆ G∗
the inverse image of the kernel of the quotient Gal(k/k)  Gk relative to some

scheme-theoretic envelope Gal(k/k) → G∗ . Suppose further that Δ∗ is slim, and
that the outer action of N on Δ∗ [arising from the extension structure] is trivial.
Thus, every element of N ⊆ G∗ lifts to a unique element of Π∗ that commutes with
Δ∗ . In particular, N lifts to a closed normal subgroup NΠ ⊆ Π∗ . We shall refer
to any extension 1 → Δ → Π → G → 1 of proﬁnite groups which is isomorphic

to an extension of the form 1 → Δ∗ → Π∗ /NΠ → G∗ /N → 1 just constructed as
an extension of [geometrically almost pro-Σ] GSAFG-type [where “GSAFG” is to
be understood as an abbreviation for “geometrically slim arithmetic fundamental
group”]. In this situation, we shall refer to any surjection π1tame (X)  Π (respectively, π1tame (Xk )  Δ; Gal(k/k)  G) obtained by composing a scheme-theoretic

envelope π1tame (X)  Π∗ (respectively, π1tame (Xk )  Δ∗ ; Gal(k/k) → G∗ ) with
the surjection Π∗  Π (respectively, Δ∗  Δ; G∗  G) in the above discussion as a scheme-theoretic envelope for Π (respectively, Δ; G); we shall refer to
(k, 
k, X, Y → Y , Σ) as a collection of construction data for this extension. [Thus,
given an extension of GSAFG-type, there are, in general, many possible choices of
construction data for the extension.]
(iv) Given construction data “(k, X, Y → Y , Σ)” or “(k, 
k, X, Y → Y , Σ)” as
in (i), (ii), (iii), we shall refer to “k” as the construction data ﬁeld, to “X” as the
construction data base-stack [or base-scheme, if X is a scheme], to “Y ” as the construction data covering, to “Y ” as the construction data covering compactiﬁcation,
and to “Σ” as the construction data prime set. Also, we shall refer to a portion
of the construction data “(k, X, Y → Y , Σ)” or “(k, 
k, X, Y → Y , Σ)” as in (i),
(ii), (iii), as partial construction data. If every prime dividing the order of a ﬁnite
quotient group of Δ is invertible in k, then we shall refer to the construction data
in question as base-prime.
The following result is well-known, but we give the proof below for lack of an
appropriate reference in the case where [in the notation of the above discussion] X
is not necessarily proper.
Proposition 2.2.
(Topological Finite Generation) Any proﬁnite group Δ
of GFG-type is topologically ﬁnitely generated.
Proof. Write (k, X, Y → Y , Σ) for a choice of construction data for Δ. Since
a proﬁnite fundamental group is topologically ﬁnitely generated if and only if it
admits an open subgroup that is topologically ﬁnitely generated, we may assume
that X = Y ; moreover, by applying de Jong’s theory of alterations [as reviewed,
for instance, in Lemma A.10 of the Appendix], we may assume that Y is projective
def

and k-smooth, and that D = Y \ Y is a divisor with normal crossings on Y . Since
we are only concerned with Δ, we may assume that k is algebraically closed, hence,
in particular, inﬁnite. Now suppose that dim(Y ) ≥ 2. Then since Y is smooth
and projective [over k], it follows that there exists a connected, k-smooth closed
subscheme C ⊆ Y obtained
 by intersecting Y with a suﬃciently general hyperplane
section H such that D H forms a divisor with normal crossings on C. Write

def
C = C Y (= ∅). Now if Z → Y is any connected ﬁnite étale covering that is
tamely ramiﬁed over D, then write Z → Y for the normalization of Y in Z. Thus,
since Z is tamely ramﬁed over D — so, by the log purity theorem reviewed above,
one may apply the well-known theory of log étale morphisms to describe the local
structure of Z → Y — and D intersects C transversely, it follows immediately
def
that Z C = Z ×Y C is normal. On the other hand, since the closed subscheme
Z C ⊆ Z arises as the zero locus of a nonzero section of an ample line bundle

TOPICS IN ABSOLUTE ANABELIAN GEOMETRY I

19

on the normal scheme Z, it thus follows [cf., [SGA2], XI, 3.11; [SGA2], XII, 2.4]
that Z C is connected, hence [since Z C is normal] irreducible. But this implies

def
that ZC = Z ×Y C = Z C Y is connected. Moreover, this connectedness of ZC
for arbitrary choices of the covering Z → Y implies that the natural morphism
π1tame (C) → π1tame (Y ) is surjective. Thus, by induction on dim(Y ), it suﬃces to
prove Proposition 2.2 in the case where Y is a curve. But in this case, [as is wellknown] Proposition 2.2 follows by deforming Y → Y to a curve in characteristic
zero, in which case the desired topological ﬁnite generation follows from the wellknown structure of the topological fundamental group of a Riemann surface of ﬁnite
type.
Proposition 2.3.

(Slimness and Elasticity for Hyperbolic Orbicurves)

(i) Let Δ be a proﬁnite group of GFG-type that admits partial construction
data (k, X, Σ) [consisting of the construction data ﬁeld, construction data basestack, and construction data prime set] such that X is a hyperbolic orbicurve
[cf. §0], and Σ contains a prime invertible in k. Then Δ is slim and elastic.
(ii) Let 1 → Δ → Π → G → 1 be an extension of GSAFG-type that
admits partial construction data (k, X, Σ) [consisting of the construction data ﬁeld,
construction data base-stack, and construction data prime set] such that X is a
hyperbolic orbicurve, Σ = ∅, and k is either an MLF or an NF. Then Π is
slim, but not elastic.
Proof. Assertion (i) is the easily veriﬁed “generalization to orbicurves over ﬁelds
of arbitrary characteristic” of [MT], Proposition 1.4; [MT], Theorem 1.5 [cf. also
Proposition 1.3, (i)]. The slimness portion of assertion (ii) follows immediately
from the slimness portion of assertion (i), together with the slimness portion of
Theorem 1.7, (ii), (iii); the fact that Π is not elastic follows from the existence of
the nontrivial, topologically ﬁnitely generated [cf. Proposition 2.2], closed, normal,
inﬁnite index subgroup Δ ⊆ Π.
Deﬁnition 2.4.

For i = 1, 2, let
1 → Δi → Πi → Gi → 1

be an extension which is either of AFG-type or of GSAFG-type. Suppose that
φ : Π1 → Π2
is a continuous homomorphism of proﬁnite groups. Then:
(i) We shall say that φ is absolute if φ is open [i.e., has open image].
(ii) We shall say that φ is semi-absolute (respectively, pre-semi-absolute) if φ
is absolute, and, moreover, the image of φ(Δ1 ) in G2 is trivial (respectively, either
trivial or of inﬁnite index in G2 ).

(iii) We shall say that φ is strictly semi-absolute (respectively, pre-strictly semiabsolute) if φ is semi-absolute, and, moreover, the subgroup φ(Δ1 ) ⊆ Δ2 is open
(respectively, either open or nontrivial).
Proposition 2.5.
i = 1, 2, let

(First Properties of Absolute Homomorphisms) For

be an extension which is either of AFG-type or of GSAFG-type; (ki , Xi , Σi )
partial construction data for Πi  Gi [consisting of the construction data ﬁeld,
construction data base-stack, and construction data prime set]. Suppose that
φ : Π1 → Π2
is a continuous homomorphism of proﬁnite groups. Then:
(i) The following implications hold:
φ strictly semi-absolute =⇒ φ pre-strictly semi-absolute =⇒ φ semi-absolute
=⇒ φ pre-semi-absolute =⇒ φ absolute.
(ii) Suppose that k2 is an NF. Then “φ semi-absolute” ⇐⇒ “φ pre-semiabsolute” ⇐⇒ “φ absolute”.
(iii) Suppose that k2 is an MLF. Then “φ semi-absolute” ⇐⇒ “φ pre-semiabsolute”.
(iv) Suppose that k1 either an FF or an MLF; that X2 is a hyperbolic
orbicurve; and that Σ2 is of cardinality > 1. Then “φ pre-strictly semi-absolute”
⇐⇒ “φ semi-absolute”.
(v) Suppose that X2 is a hyperbolic orbicurve, and that Σ2 contains a
prime invertible in k2 . Then “φ strictly semi-absolute” ⇐⇒ “φ pre-strictly semiabsolute”.
Proof. Assertion (i) follows immediately from the deﬁnitions. Since Δ1 is topologically ﬁnitely generated [cf. Proposition 2.2], assertion (ii) (respectively, (iii))
follows immediately, in light of assertion (i), from the fact that G2 is very elastic
[cf. Theorem 1.7, (iii)] (respectively, elastic [cf. Theorem 1.7, (ii)]). To verify
assertion (iv), it suﬃces, in light of assertion (i), to consider the case where φ is
semi-absolute, but not pre-strictly semi-absolute. Then since Δ2 is elastic [cf. the
hypothesis on Σ2 ; Proposition 2.3, (i)], and Δ1 is topologically ﬁnitely generated [cf.
Proposition 2.2], it follows that the subgroup φ(Δ1 ) ⊆ Δ2 is either open or trivial.
Since φ is not pre-strictly semi-absolute, we thus conclude that φ(Δ1 ) = {1}, so φ
induces an open homomorphism G1 → Π2 . That is to say, every suﬃciently small
open subgroup Δ∗2 ⊆ Δ2 admits a surjection H1  Δ∗2 for some closed subgroup
H1 ⊆ G1 . On the other hand, since X2 is a hyperbolic orbicurve, and Σ2 is of
cardinality > 1, it follows [e.g., from the well-known structure of topological fundamental groups of hyperbolic Riemann surfaces of ﬁnite type] that we may take

TOPICS IN ABSOLUTE ANABELIAN GEOMETRY I

Δ∗2 such that Δ∗2 admits quotients Δ∗2  F  , Δ∗2  F  , where F  (respectively,
F  ) is a nonabelian free pro-p (respectively, pro-p ) group, for distinct p , p ∈ Σ2 .
But this contradicts the well-known structure of G1 , when k1 is either an FF or
an MLF — i.e., the fact that G1 , hence also H1 , may be written as an extension
of a meta-abelian group by a pro-p subgroup, for some prime p. [Here, we recall
that this fact is immediate if k1 is an FF, in which case G1 is abelian, and follows,
for instance, from [NSW], Theorem 7.5.2; [NSW], Corollary 7.5.6, (i), when k1 is a
MLF.] Assertion (v) follows immediately from the elasticity of Δ2 [cf. Proposition
2.3, (i)], together with the topological ﬁnite generation of Δ1 [cf. Proposition 2.2].

Then

are “group-theoretic”] as the intersection of the open subgroups H ⊆ Π such that
ζ(H)/ζ(Π) = [Π : H].
(vi) Suppose that k is an NF. Then the natural surjection Πab-t  Gab-t is an
isomorphism. The kernel of the quotient Π  G may be characterized [“grouptheoretically”] as the maximal topologically ﬁnitely generated closed normal subgroup of Π. In particular, Π is not topologically ﬁnitely generated.
Proof. Write X → A for the Albanese morphism associated to X. [We refer to
the Appendix for a review of the theory of Albanese varieties — cf., especially,
Corollary A.11, Remark A.11.2.] Thus, A is a torsor over a semi-abelian variety
over k such that the morphism X → A induces an isomorphism

onto the l-adic Tate module Tl (A) of A for all l ∈ Σ. Note, moreover, that for l ∈ Σ,
the quotient of Δ determined by the image of Δ in the pro-l completion of Πab-t
factors through the quotient

Δ  Δab-t ⊗ Zl → Tl (A)  Tl (A)/G
— where we use the notation “/G” to denote the maximal torsion-free quotient on
which G acts trivially.

[in which we take “k” to be k and “B” to be the semi-abelian variety over which

A is a torsor]. Here, we observe that Ql is simply the quotient Tl (A)/G considered
above. Thus, the Zl -ranks of Rl , Ql are independent of l ∈ Σ.
The topological ﬁnite generation portion of assertion (i) follows immediately
 together with the topological ﬁnite generation of Δ [cf.
from the fact that G ∼
= Z,
Proposition 2.2]. The remainder of assertion (i) follows immediately from the fact
that Tl (A)/G = 0 [a consequence of the “Riemann hypothesis for abelian varieties
over ﬁnite ﬁelds” — cf., e.g., [Mumf], p. 206]. In a similar vein, assertion (vi)
follows immediately from the fact that Tl (A)/G = 0 [again a consequence of the
“Riemann hypothesis for abelian varieties over ﬁnite ﬁelds”], together with the fact
that G is very elastic [cf. Theorem 1.7, (iii)].
To verify assertion (ii), let us ﬁrst observe that the topological ﬁnite generation
of Π follows from that of Δ [cf. Proposition 2.2], together with that of G [cf. [NSW],
Theorem 7.5.10]. Next, let us recall the well-known fact that
δl1 (G) = 1 if l = p,

δp1 (G) = [k : Qp ] + 1

[cf. our discussion of local class ﬁeld theory in the proofs of Proposition 1.5; Theorem
1.7, (ii)]; in particular, ζ(G) = [k : Qp ]. Moreover, the existence of a rational point
of A over some ﬁnite extension of k [which determines a Galois section of the étale
fundamental group of A over some open subgroup of G] implies that
δl1 (Π) = δl1 (G) + dimQl (Ql ⊗ Ql )
[where we recall that dimQl (Ql ⊗ Ql ) is independent of l] for l ∈ Σ, δl1 (Π) = δl1 (G)
for l ∈
/ Σ. Thus, by considering extensions of k of arbitrarily large degree, we obtain
that 1p (Π) = ∞. This completes the proof of assertion (ii).
Next, we consider assertion (iii). First, let us consider the “E2 -term” of the
Leray spectral sequence of the group extension 1 → Δ → Π → G → 1. Since G is
of cohomological dimension 2 [cf., e.g., [NSW], Theorem 7.1.8, (i)], and δl2 (G) = 0
for all l ∈ Primes [cf., e.g., [NSW], Theorem 7.2.6], the spectral sequence yields an
equality δl2 (Π) = 0 if l ∈
/ Σ, and a pair of injections
H 1 (G, Hom(Rl , Ql )) → H 1 (G, Hom(Δab-t , Ql )) → H 2 (Π, Ql )
if l ∈ Σ [cf. Lemma 2.7, (iii), below]. By applying the analogue of this conclusion
for an arbitrary open subgroup H ⊆ Π, we thus obtain that δl2 (H) = 0 if l ∈
/ Σ,
2
2
i.e., that l (Π) = 0 if l ∈
/ Σ; this already implies that if l ∈
/ Σ, then l ∈
/ θ (Π),
i.e., that θ2 (Π) ⊆ Σ. If the cardinality of θ1 (Π) is ≥ 2, then there exists some
open subgroup H ⊆ Π and some l ∈ Primes such that δl1 (H) ≥ 2, l = p. Now
we may assume without loss of generality that H acts trivially on the quotient
R; also to simplify notation, we may replace Π by H and assume that H = Π.
Then [since δl1 (G) = 1, by assertion (ii)] the fact that δl1 (Π) ≥ 2 implies that
l ∈ Σ, and dimQl (Rl ⊗ Ql ) ≥ 1 [cf. our computation in the proof of assertion (ii)].
But this implies that for any l ∈ Σ, we have dimQl (Rl ⊗ Ql ) ≥ 1, hence that
H 1 (G, Hom(Rl , Ql )) = H 1 (G, Ql ) ⊗ Hom(Rl , Ql ) = 0. Thus, by the injections
discussed above, we conclude that 2l (Π) ≥ δl2 (Π) ≥ 1, so l ∈ θ2 (Π). This completes
the proof of assertion (iii).


Assertion (iv) follows immediately from the existence of a surjection G  Z
[cf., e.g., Proposition 1.5, (ii)], together with the elasticity of G [cf. Theorem 1.7,
(ii)], and the topological ﬁnite generation of Δ [cf. Proposition 2.2].
Next, we consider assertion (v). First, let us observe that whenever Σ =
Primes, it follows from assertion (ii) that ζ(Π) = ζ(G) = [k : Qp ].
Now we consider the case θ2 (Π) = Primes. In this case, Θ = {1} [by definition], and θ2 (Π) = Σ = Primes [by assertion (iii)]. Thus, we obtain that
ζ(Π) = ζ(Π/Θ) = [k : Qp ], as desired [cf. [Mzk6], Lemma 1.1.4, (ii)]. Next,
we consider the case θ1 (Π) = {p} [i.e., θ1 (Π) is of cardinality ≥ 2 — cf. assertion (ii)], θ2 (Π) = Primes. In this case, by assertion (iii), we conclude that
Σ = θ2 (Π) = Primes. Thus, by assertion (iv), Θ = Δ, so ζ(Π/Θ) = ζ(G) = [k : Qp ],
as desired.
Finally, we consider the case θ1 (Π) = {p} [i.e., θ1 (Π) is of cardinality one],
θ (Π) = Primes. If Σ = Primes, then it follows from the deﬁnition of Θ, together
with assertion (iv), that Θ = Δ, hence that ζ(Π/Θ) = ζ(G) = [k : Qp ], as desired.
If, on the other hand, Σ = Primes, then since θ1 (Π) = {p}, it follows [cf. the
computation in the proof of assertion (ii)] that dimQl (Ql ⊗ Ql ) = 0 for all primes
l = p, hence that dimQp (Qp ⊗ Qp ) = 0; but this implies that δl1 (Π) = δl1 (G) for
all l ∈ Primes. Now since Θ ⊆ Δ [by assertion (iv)], it follows that δl1 (Π) ≥
δl1 (Π/Θ) ≥ δl1 (G) for all l ∈ Primes, so we obtain that δl1 (Π) = δl1 (Π/Θ) = δl1 (G)
for all l ∈ Primes. But this implies that ζ(Π) = ζ(Π/Θ) = ζ(G) = [k : Qp ], as
desired. This completes the proof of assertion (v).

Remark 2.6.1. When [in the notation of Theorem 2.6] X is a smooth proper
variety, the portion of Theorem 2.6, (ii), concerning “δl1 (Π) − δl1 (G)” is essentially
equivalent to the main result of [Yoshi].

Proof. Assertion (i) is literally the content of [Mzk6], Lemma 1.1.5. Assertion
(ii) follows immediately from the proof of [Mzk6], Lemma 1.1.5 [more precisely, the
“combinatorial” quotient “Tcom ” of loc. cit.]. Assertion (iii) follows by considering
the long exact cohomology sequence associated to the short exact sequence 0 →

Corollary 2.8. (Field Types and Absolute Homomorphisms) For i = 1, 2,
let 1 → Δi → Πi → Gi → 1, ki , Xi , Σi , φ : Π1 → Π2 be as in Proposition 2.5.
Suppose further that ki is either an FF, an MLF, or an NF, and that every prime
∈ Σi is invertible in ki . Then:
(i) Suppose further that φ is absolute. Then the ﬁeld type of k1 is ≥ [cf.
§0] the ﬁeld type of k2 . If, moreover, it holds either that both k1 and k2 are FF’s
or that both k1 and k2 are NF’s, then φ is semi-absolute, i.e., φ(Δ1 ) ⊆ Δ2 .
(ii) Suppose further that φ is an isomorphism. Then the ﬁeld types of k1 ,
k2 coincide, and φ is strictly semi-absolute, i.e., φ(Δ1 ) = Δ2 . If, moreover,
for i = 1, 2, ki is an MLF of residue characteristic pi , then p1 = p2 .
Proof. Assertion (i) concerning the inequality “≥” follows immediately from the
topological ﬁnite generation portions of Theorem 2.6, (i), (ii), (vi), together with
the estimates of “δl1 (−)”, “1l (−)” in Theorem 2.6, (i), (ii). The ﬁnal portion of
assertion follows, in the case of FF’s, from Theorem 2.6, (i), and, in the case of
NF’s, from Proposition 2.5, (ii). Next, we consider assertion (ii). The fact that
the ﬁeld types of k1 , k2 coincide follows from assertion (i) applied to φ, φ−1 . To
verify that φ is strictly semi-absolute, let us ﬁrst observe that every semi-absolute
isomorphism whose inverse is also semi-absolute is necessarily strictly semi-absolute.
Thus, since the inverse to φ satisﬁes the same hypotheses as φ, to complete the
proof of Corollary 2.8, it suﬃces to verify that φ is semi-absolute. If k1 , k2 are
FF’s (respectively, MLF’s; NF’s), then this follows immediately from the “grouptheoretic” characterizations of Πi  Gi in Theorem 2.6, (i) (respectively, Theorem
2.6, (v); Theorem 2.6, (vi)). Finally, if, for i = 1, 2, ki is an MLF of residue
∼
characteristic pi , then since φ induces an isomorphism G1 → G2 , the fact that
p1 = p2 follows, for instance, from [Mzk6], Proposition 1.2.1, (i).
Remark 2.8.1. In the situation of Corollary 2.8, suppose further that k2 is an
MLF of residue characteristic p2 ; that X2 is a hyperbolic orbicurve; that Σ2 ⊆ {p2 }
[cf. Proposition 2.5, (iv)]; and that if Σ2 = ∅, then k1 is an NF. Then it is not clear
to the author at the time of writing [but of interest in the context of the theory of
the present §2!] whether or not there exists a continuous surjective homomorphism
G1  Π2
[in which case, by Corollary 2.8, (i), k1 is either an NF or an MLF].

The general theory discussed so far for arbitrary X becomes substantially simpler and more explicit, when X is a hyperbolic orbicurve.
Deﬁnition 2.9. Let G be a proﬁnite group. Then we shall refer to as an aug-free
decomposition of G any pair of closed subgroups H1 , H2 ⊆ G that determine an
isomorphism of proﬁnite groups
∼

H1 × H 2 → G
such that H1 is a slim, topologically ﬁnitely generated, augmented pro-prime [cf.
Deﬁnition 1.1, (iii)] proﬁnite group, and H2 is either trivial or a nonabelian pro-Σsolvable free group for some set Σ ⊆ Primes of cardinality ≥ 2. In this situation,
we shall refer to H1 as the augmented subgroup of this aug-free decomposition and
to H2 as the free subgroup of this aug-free decomposition. If G admits an aug-free
decomposition, then we shall say that G is of aug-free type. If G is of aug-free type,
with nontrivial free subgroup, then we shall say that G is of strictly aug-free type.
Proposition 2.10.

(First Properties of Aug-free Decompositions) Let
∼

H1 × H2 → G
be an aug-free decomposition of a proﬁnite group G, in which H1 is the augmented subgroup, and H2 is the free subgroup. Then:
(i) Let J be a topologically ﬁnitely generated, augmented pro-prime
group; φ : J → G a continuous homomorphism of proﬁnite groups such that φ(J)
is normal in some open subgroup of G. Then φ(J) ⊆ H1 .
∼

(ii) Aug-free decompositions are unique — i.e., if J1 × J2 → G is any augfree decomposition of G, in which J1 is the augmented subgroup, and J2 is the free
subgroup, then J1 = H1 , J2 = H2 .
Proof. First, we consider assertion (i). Suppose that φ(J) is not contained in H1 .
Then the image I ⊆ H2 of φ(J) via the projection to H2 is a nontrivial, topologically
ﬁnitely generated closed subgroup which is normal in an open subgroup of H2 . Since
H2 is elastic [cf. [MT], Theorem 1.5], it follows that I is open in H2 , hence that
I is a nonabelian pro-Σ-solvable free group for some set Σ ⊆ Primes of cardinality
≥ 2. On the other hand, since I is a quotient of the augmented pro-prime group J,
it follows that there exists a p ∈ Primes such that the maximal pro-(= p) quotient
of I is abelian. But this implies that Σ ⊆ {p}, a contradiction. Next, we consider
assertion (ii). By assertion (i), J1 ⊆ H1 , H1 ⊆ J1 . Thus, H1 = J1 . Now since
H1 = J1 is slim, it follows that the centralizer ZH1 (G) (respectively, ZJ1 (G)) is
equal to H2 (respectively, J2 ), so H2 = J2 , as desired.

“RTF-aug”, “RTF-free” to denote the augmented and free subgroups of the maximal pro-RTF-quotient whenever this maximal pro-RTF-quotient is of aug-free
type. Then:
(i) Suppose that Π[l] = {1} for some l ∈ Primes. Then Π[l] = Δ, Σ = {l};
Π[l ] = {1} for all l ∈ Primes such that l = l.

(ii) Suppose that Π[l] = {1} for all l ∈ Primes. Then Σ is of cardinality ≥ 2.
Moreover, for every open subgroup J ⊆ Π, there exists an open subgroup H ⊆ J
which is characteristic as a subgroup of Π such that H RTF is of aug-free type.
In particular, [cf. Proposition 2.10, (ii)] the subquotients H RTF-aug , H RTF-free of Π
are characteristic.
(iii) Suppose that Π[l] = {1} for all l ∈ Primes. Suppose, moreover, that
H ⊆ Π is an open subgroup that corresponds to a ﬁnite étale covering Z → X,
where Z is a hyperbolic curve, deﬁned over a ﬁnite extension kZ of k such
that Z has stable reduction [cf. §0] over the ring of integers OkZ of kZ ; that
Z(kZ ) = ∅; that the dual graph ΓZ of the geometric special ﬁber of the resulting
model [cf. §0] over OkZ has either trivial or nonabelian topological fundamental
group; and that the Galois action of G on ΓZ is trivial. Thus, the ﬁnite Galois

[arising from the natural morphisms involved]; the open homomorphism H RTF →
J RTF induced by φ maps H RTF-aug (respectively, H RTF-free ) onto an open subgroup
of J RTF-aug (respectively, J RTF-free ).
Proof. Since Δ is elastic [cf. Proposition 2.3, (i)], every nontrivial topologically
ﬁnitely generated closed normal subgroup of Δ is open, hence almost pro-Σ for
Σ ⊆ Primes if and only if Σ ⊇ Σ. Also, let us observe that by Theorem 2.6, (iv),
Π[l] ⊆ Δ for all l ∈ Primes. Thus, if Π[l] = {1} for some l ∈ Primes, then it follows
that Σ = {l}, Π[l] = Δ, and that Π[l ] is ﬁnite, hence trivial [since Δ is slim — cf.
Proposition 2.3, (i)] for primes l = l. Also, we observe that if Σ is of cardinality
one, i.e., Σ = {l} for some l ∈ Primes, then Δ = Π[l] = {1} [cf. Theorem 2.6,
(iv)]. This completes the proof of assertion (i), as well as of the portion of assertion
(ii) concerning Σ. Also, we observe that the remainder of assertion (ii) follows
immediately from assertion (iii).
Next, we consider assertion (iii). Suppose that H ⊆ Π satisﬁes the hypotheses

def
given in the statement of assertion (iii); write ΔH = Δ H. Thus, one has the
com
quotient H  Δcom
is either trivial or a nonabelian pro-Σ free group,
H , where ΔH
and Σ is of cardinality ≥ 2 [cf. the portion of assertion (ii) concerning Σ]. Write
ab-t
Δab
 R for the maximal pro-Σ quotient of the quotient “R” of Lemma
H = ΔH
2.7, (ii), associated to the Albanese variety of Z.
Now I claim that the quotient ΔH  R coincides with the quotient ΔH 
com ab
(ΔH ) . First, let us observe that by the deﬁnition of R [cf. Lemma 2.7, (ii)], it
ab
follows that the quotient ΔH  (Δcom
factors through the quotient ΔH  R.
H )
ab
In particular, since, for l ∈ Σ, the modules R⊗Zl , (Δcom
H ) ⊗Zl are Zl -free modules
of rank independent of l ∈ Σ [cf. Lemma 2.7, (ii); the fact that Δcom
is pro-Σ free],
H

it suﬃces to show that these two ranks are equal, for some l ∈ Σ. Moreover, let
us observe that for the purpose of verifying this claim, we may enlarge Σ. Thus,
it suﬃces to show that the two ranks are equal for some l ∈ Σ such that l = p.
But then the claim follows immediately from the [well-known] fact that by the
“Riemann hypothesis for abelian varieties over ﬁnite ﬁelds” [cf., e.g., [Mumf], p.
206], all powers of the Frobenius element in the absolute Galois group of the residue
ﬁeld of k act with eigenvalues = 1 on the pro-l abelianizations of the fundamental
groups of the geometric irreducible components of the smooth locus of the special
ﬁber of the stable model of Z over OkZ . This completes the proof of the claim.
Now let us write H  H com for the quotient of H by Ker(ΔH  Δcom
H ). Then
by applying the above claim to various open subgroups of H, we conclude that
the quotient H  H RTF factors through the quotient H  H com [i.e., we have a
∼
natural isomorphism H RTF → (H com )RTF ]. On the other hand, since Z(kZ ) = ∅,
it follows that H  HG , hence also H com  HG admits a section s : HG → H com
whose image lies in the kernel of the quotient H com  Δcom
[cf. the proof of
H
[Mzk3], Lemma 1.4]. In particular, we conclude that the conjugation action of HG

on Δcom

Since HG
is slim, augmented pro-prime, and topologically ﬁnitely generated [cf.
Proposition 1.5, (i), (ii); Theorem 2.6, (ii)], we thus conclude that we have obtained
an aug-free decomposition of H RTF , as asserted in the statement of assertion (iii).
Finally, given an open subgroup J ⊆ Π, the existence of an open subgroup
H ⊆ J which satisﬁes the hypotheses on “H” in the statement of assertion (iii)
follows immediately from well-known facts concerning stable curves over discretely
valued ﬁelds [cf., e.g., the “stable reduction theorem” of [DM]; the fact that Σ = ∅,
so that one may assume that ΓZ is as large as one wishes by passing to admissible
coverings]. The fact that one can choose H to be characteristic follows immediately
from the characteristic nature of Δ [cf., e.g., Corollary 2.8, (ii)], together with the
fact that Δ, Π are topologically ﬁnitely generated [cf., e.g. Proposition 2.2; Theorem
2.6, (ii)]. This completes the proof of assertion (iii).
Finally, we consider assertion (iv). First, we observe that since the augmented
and free subgroups of any aug-free decomposition are slim [cf. Deﬁnition 2.9; [MT],
Proposition 1.4], hence, in particular, do not contain any nontrivial closed normal ﬁnite subgroups, we may always replace H by an open subgroup of H that satisﬁes the
same hypotheses as H. In particular, we may assume that H is an open subgroup
“H” as in assertion (iii) [which exists, by assertion (iii)]. Then by Proposition 2.10,
(i), the image of H RTF-aug in J RTF is contained in J RTF-aug , so we obtain a morRTF
phism H RTF-aug → J RTF-aug . By assertion (iii), H RTF-free = Ker(H RTF  HG

RTF
that the natural morphism H RTF-aug → JG
, hence also the natural morphism

J
→ JG , is open. Thus, the image of J RTF-free in JG
commutes with an
RTF

RTF
open subgroup of JG [i.e., the image of J
in JG ], so by the slimness of
RTF
RTF-free
RTF
JG [cf. Proposition 1.5, (i)], we conclude that J
⊆ Ker(J RTF  JG
).

In particular, we obtain a surjection J

— where we write N = Ker(J RTF-aug  JG
) ⊆ J RTF-aug ⊆ J RTF . Note,
RTF
moreover, that since JG
is an augmented pro-p group [cf. Proposition 1.5, (ii)]
RTF
which admits a surjection JG
 Zp × Zp [cf. the computation of “δp1 (−)” in
Theorem 2.6, (ii)], it follows immediately that [the augmented pro-prime group]
RTF
J RTF-aug is an augmented pro-p group whose augmentation factors through JG
;
in particular, we conclude that N is pro-p. Also, we observe that since the composite
RTF
RTF
H RTF-free → HG
→ JG
is trivial, it follows that the projection under the
quotient J RTF  J RTF-aug of the image of H RTF-free in J RTF is contained in N .

Now I claim that to complete the proof of assertion (iv), it suﬃces to verify
that N = {1} [or, equivalently, since J RTF-aug is slim, that N is ﬁnite]. Indeed,
∼
RTF

if N = {1}, then we obtain immediately the isomorphisms J RTF-aug → JG

RTF-free
RTF
RTF
J
→ Ker(J
 JG ). Moreover, by the above discussion, if N = {1},
then it follows that the image of H RTF-free in J RTF is contained in J RTF-free . Since
the homomorphism H RTF → J RTF is open, this implies that the open homomorphism H RTF  J RTF induced by φ maps H RTF-aug (respectively, H RTF-free ) onto
an open subgroup of J RTF-aug (respectively, J RTF-free ), as desired. This completes
the proof of the claim.

Next, let J ⊆ J be an open subgroup that arises as the inverse image in J
of an [open] RTF-subgroup J G ⊆ JG [so the notation “J G ” does not lead to any
contradictions]. Then one veriﬁes immediately from the deﬁnitions that any RTFsubgroup of J G (respectively, J) determines an RTF-subgroup of JG (respectively,
J). Thus, the natural morphisms
RTF
J RTF
→ JG
;
G

J RTF → J RTF


are injective. Moreover, the subgroups J RTF-aug J RTF , J RTF-free of J RTF clearly
determine an aug-free decomposition of J RTF . Thus, from the point of view of
verifying the ﬁniteness of N , we may replace J by J [and H by an appropriate
smaller open subgroup contained in J and satisfying the hypotheses of the “H” of
(iii)]. In particular, since — by the deﬁnition of “RTF” and of the subgroup N ! —
there exists a J such that N ⊆ J RTF-aug has nontrivial image in (J RTF-aug )ab-t , we
may assume without loss of generality that N has nontrivial image in (J RTF-aug )ab-t .
Thus, we have
RTF
(δp1 (J) ≥) δp1 (J RTF-aug ) > δp1 (JG
) = δp1 (JG )

def

RTF
[cf. the notation of Theorem 2.6], i.e., sJ = δp1 (J RTF-aug ) − δp1 (JG
) > 0. By
Theorem 2.6, (ii), this already implies that p ∈ Σ.

In a similar vein, let J ⊆ J be an open subgroup that arises as the inverse
image in J of an [open] RTF-subgroup J RTF-free ⊆ J RTF-free . Then one veriﬁes
immediately from the deﬁnitions that any RTF-subgroup of J determines an RTFsubgroup of J. Thus, the natural morphism J RTF → J RTF is injective, with image
equal to J RTF-aug × J RTF-free . Moreover, the subgroups J RTF-aug , J RTF-free of J RTF
clearly determine an aug-free decomposition of J RTF [so the notation “J RTF-free ”
does not lead to any contradictions]. Since [by the above discussion applied to
J instead of J] J RTF-free maps to the identity in J RTF
G , we thus obtain a quotient
RTF

J
,
hence
a
quotient
J RTF  J RTF-aug  J RTF
J RTF  J RTF-aug = J RTF-aug
G
G

in which the image of J Δ is a ﬁnite normal closed subgroup, hence trivial [since
is slim — cf. Proposition 1.5, (i)]. That is to say, the surjection J 
J RTF
G
RTF-aug
 J RTF
to the pro-RTF-group J RTF
factors through JG , hence through
J
G
G
RTF

whose composite JG

JG

J G → JG with the natural morphism induced by the inclusion J → J is the

identity [since JG

isomorphism. In particular, we have an isomorphism of kernels Ker(J

Thus,
from
the

of
verifying
the

ﬁniteness of N , we may replace J by J [and H by an appropriate smaller open
subgroup contained in J and satisfying the hypotheses of the “H” of (iii)]. In
∼
particular, since J RTF-aug → J RTF-aug , we may assume without loss of generality
that the rank rJ of the pro-ΣJ -solvable free group J RTF-free [for some subset ΣJ ⊆
Primes of cardinality ≥ 2] is either 0 or > δp1 (J RTF-aug ). In particular, if l ∈ ΣJ ,
then either rJ = 0 or rJ = δl1 (J RTF-free ) > δp1 (J RTF-aug ) ≥ sJ .

Now we compute: Since Σ is of cardinality ≥ 2, let l ∈ Σ be a prime = p. Then:
RTF
δl1 (J RTF-free ) = δl1 (J RTF-free ) + δl1 (J RTF-aug ) − δl1 (JG
)
RTF
) = δl1 (J) − δl1 (JG )
= δl1 (J RTF ) − δl1 (JG
RTF
)
= δp1 (J) − δp1 (JG ) = δp1 (J RTF ) − δp1 (JG
RTF
) = δp1 (J RTF-free ) + sJ
= δp1 (J RTF-free ) + δp1 (J RTF-aug ) − δp1 (JG

— where we apply the “independence of l” of Theorem 2.6, (ii). Thus, we conclude
that sJ = δl1 (J RTF-free ) − δp1 (J RTF-free ) — where δl1 (J RTF-free ), δp1 (J RTF-free ) ∈
{0, rJ } [depending on whether or not l, p belong to ΣJ ] — is a positive integer. But
this implies that 0 < sJ ∈ {0, rJ , −rJ }, hence that sJ = rJ > 0 — in contradiction
to the inequality sJ < rJ [which holds if rJ > 0]. This completes the proof of
assertion (iv).
Remark 2.11.1.
One way of thinking about the content of Theorem 2.11,
(iv), is that it asserts that “aug-free decompositions of maximal pro-RTFquotients play an analogous [though somewhat more complicated] role for absolute
Galois groups of MLF’s to the role played by torsion-free abelianizations for
absolute Galois groups of FF’s” [cf. Theorem 2.6, (i)].
Corollary 2.12. (Group-theoretic Semi-absoluteness via Maximal ProRTF-quotients) For i = 1, 2, let 1 → Δi → Πi → Gi → 1, ki , Xi , Σi , φ :
Π1 → Π2 be as in Proposition 2.5. Suppose further that ki is an MLF; Xi is a
hyperbolic orbicurve; Σi = ∅. Also, for i = 1, 2, let us write
Θi ⊆ Πi
for the maximal almost pro-prime topologically ﬁnitely generated closed normal
subgroup of Πi , whenever a unique such maximal subgroup exists; if there does not
def
exist a unique such maximal subgroup, then we set Θi = {1}. Suppose that φ is
absolute. Then:
(i) For i = 1, 2, Θi ⊆ Δi ; Θi = {1} if and only if Σi is of cardinality
one; if Θi = {1}, then Θi = Δi . Finally, φ(Θ1 ) ⊆ Θ2 [so φ induces a morphism
Π1 /Θ1 → Π2 /Θ2 ].
(ii) In the notation of Theorem 2.11, φ is semi-absolute [or, equivalently,
pre-semi-absolute — cf. Proposition 2.5, (iii)] if and only if the following [“grouptheoretic”] condition holds:
(∗s-ab ) For i = 1, 2, let Hi ⊆ Πi /Θi be an open subgroup such that HiRTF is
of aug-free type, and [the morphism induced by] φ maps H1 into H2 .
Then the open homomorphism
H1RTF → H2RTF
induced by φ maps H1RTF-free into H2RTF-free .

(iii) If, moreover, Σ2 is of cardinality ≥ 2, then φ is semi-absolute if and
only if it is strictly semi-absolute [or, equivalently, pre-strictly semi-absolute
— cf. Proposition 2.5, (v)].
Proof. First, we consider assertion (i). By Theorem 2.6, (iv), any almost proprime topologically ﬁnitely generated closed normal subgroup of Πi — hence, in
particular, Θi — is contained in Δi . Thus, by Theorem 2.11, (i), (ii), Θi = {1}
if and only if Σi is of cardinality one; if Θi = {1}, then Θi = Δi . Now to show
that φ(Θ1 ) ⊆ Θ2 , it suﬃces to consider the case where φ(Θ1 ) = {1} [so Σ1 is of
cardinality one]. Since φ is absolute, it follows that φ(Θ1 ) is normal in some open
subgroup of Π2 . Thus, by Theorem 2.6, (iv), we have φ(Θ1 ) ⊆ Δ2 , so we may
assume that Θ2 = {1} [which implies that Σ2 is of cardinality ≥ 2]. But then the
elasticity of Δ2 [cf. Proposition 2.3, (i)] implies that φ(Θ1 ) is an open subgroup
of Δ2 , hence that φ(Θ1 ) is almost pro-Σ2 [for some Σ2 of cardinality ≥ 2], which
contradicts the fact that φ(Θ1 ) is almost pro-Σ1 [for some Σ1 of cardinality one].
This completes the proof of assertion (i).
Next, we consider assertion (ii). By Proposition 2.5, (iii), one may replace
the term “semi-absolute” in assertion (ii) by the term “pre-semi-absolute”. By
assertion (i), for i = 1, 2, either Θi = {1} or Θi = Δi ; in either case, it follows from
Theorem 2.11, (iv) [cf. also Proposition 1.5, (i), (ii)], that [in the notation of (∗s-ab )]
the projection HiRTF  HiRTF-aug may be identiﬁed with the projection HiRTF 
(Hi )RTF
[which is an isomorphism whenever Θi = Δi ]. Thus, the condition (∗s-ab )
Gi
may be thought of as the condition that the morphism H1RTF → H2RTF be compatible
with the projection morphisms HiRTF  (Hi )RTF
Gi . From this point of view, it
follows immediately that the semi-absoluteness of φ implies (∗s-ab ), and that (∗s-ab )
implies [in light of the existence of H1 , H2 — cf. Theorem 2.11, (ii)] the pre-semiabsoluteness of φ. Assertion (iii) follows from Proposition 2.5, (iv), (v).
Remark 2.12.1. The criterion of Corollary 2.12, (ii), may be thought of as a
“group-theoretic Hom-version”, in the case of hyperbolic orbicurves, of the numerical
criterion “ζ(H)/ζ(Π) = [Π : H]” of Theorem 2.6, (v). Alternatively [cf. the point
of view of Remark 2.11.1], this criterion of Corollary 2.12, (ii), may be thought of
as a [necessarily — cf. Example 2.13 below!] somewhat more complicated version
for MLF’s of the latter portion of Corollary 2.8, (i), in the case of FF’s or NF’s.
Example 2.13.

A Non-pre-semi-absolute Absolute Homomorphism.

(i) In the situation of Theorem 2.11, suppose that Σ = Primes. Fix a natural
number N [which one wants to think of as being “large”]. By replacing Π by an open
subgroup of Π, we may assume that Π satisﬁes the hypotheses of the subgroup “H”
of Theorem 2.11, (iii), and that the dual graph of the special ﬁber of X is not a tree
[cf. the discussion preceding [Mzk6], Lemma 2.4]. Thus, we have a “combinatorial”
quotient Π  Δcom , where Δcom is a nonabelian proﬁnite free group. In particular,
there exists an open subgroup of Δcom which is a proﬁnite free group on > N
generators. Thus, by replacing Π by an open subgroup of Π arising from an open
subgroup of Δcom , we may assume from the start that Δcom is a proﬁnite free group
on > N generators.

TOPICS IN ABSOLUTE ANABELIAN GEOMETRY I

(ii) Now let

33

1 → Δ∗ → Π∗ → G∗ → 1

be an extension of AFG-type that admits a construction data ﬁeld which is an MLF.
Thus, Π∗ is topologically ﬁnitely generated [cf. Theorem 2.6, (ii)], so it follows that
there exists a Π as in (i), together with a surjection of proﬁnite groups
ψ : Π  Π∗
that factors through the quotient Π  Δcom . In particular, ψ is an absolute
homomorphism which is not pre-semi-absolute [hence, a fortiori, not semi-absolute].
In light of the appearance of the “combinatorial quotient” in Theorem 2.11,
(iii), we pause to recall the following result [cf. [Mzk6], Lemma 2.3, in the proﬁnite
case].
Theorem 2.14. (Graph-theoreticity for Hyperbolic Curves) For i = 1, 2,
let 1 → Δi → Πi → Gi → 1, ki , Xi , Σi , φ : Π1 → Π2 be as in Proposition 2.5.
Suppose further that ki is an MLF of residue characteristic pi ; that Σi contains a
prime = pi ; that φ is an isomorphism; and that Xi is a hyperbolic curve with
stable reduction over the ring of integers Oki of ki . Write Γi for the dual semigraph with compact structure [i.e., the dual graph, together with additional
open edges corresponding to the cusps — cf. [Mzk6], Appendix] of the geometric
special ﬁber of the stable model of Xi over Oki . Then:
∼

∼

(i) We have p1 = p2 , Σ1 = Σ2 ; φ induces isomorphisms Δ1 → Δ2 , G1 → G2 ;
∼
φ induces an isomorphism of semi-graphs φΓ : Γ1 → Γ2 which is functorial
in φ. In particular, the natural Galois action of G1 on Γ1 is compatible, relative to
φΓ , with the natural Galois action of G2 on Γ2 .
(ii) For i = 1, 2, suppose that the action of Gi on Γi is trivial. Write Πi 
for the pro-Σi “combinatorial” quotient determined by the ﬁnite Galois
coverings of the semi-graph Γi of degree a product of primes ∈ Σi . Then φ is
compatible with the quotients Πi  Δcom
.
i
Δcom
i

Proof. First, we consider assertion (i). By Corollary 2.8, (ii), p1 = p2 , and φ
∼
∼
induces isomorphisms Δ1 → Δ2 , G1 → G2 . Since [by the well-known structure
of geometric fundamental groups of hyperbolic curves] Σi is the unique minimal
Σ ⊆ Primes such that Δi is almost pro-Σ, we thus conclude that Σ1 = Σ2 . Write
def
def
p = p1 = p2 , Σ = Σ1 = Σ2 ; let l ∈ Σ be such that l = p. Then it follows
immediately from the “Riemann hypothesis for abelian varieties over ﬁnite ﬁelds”
[cf., e.g., [Mumf], p. 206] that the action of Gi on the maximal pro-l quotient Δi 
(l)
Δi is — in the terminology of [Mzk12] — “l-graphically full”. Thus, by [Mzk12],
(l) ∼
(l)
Corollary 2.7, (ii), the isomorphism Δ1 → Δ2 is — again in the terminology
of [Mzk12] — “graphic”, hence induces a functorial isomorphism of semi-graphs
∼
Γ1 → Γ2 , as desired.
Next, we consider assertion (ii). First, we observe that, by assertion (i), the
condition that the action of Gi on Γi be trivial is compatible with φ. Also, let us

34

observe that if Hi ⊆ Πi is an open subgroup corresponding to a ﬁnite étale covering
Zi → Xi of Xi , then the condition that Zi have stable reduction is compatible with
φ [cf. [Mzk6], the proof of Lemma 2.1; our assumption that there exists an l ∈ Σi
such that l = pi ]. Next, I claim that:
if and only
A ﬁnite étale Galois covering Zi → Xi of Xi arises from Δcom
i
if Zi has stable reduction, and the action of Gal(Zi /Xi ) on the dual semigraph with compact structure of the geometric special ﬁber of the stable
model of Zi is free.
Indeed, the necessity of this criterion is clear. To verify the suﬃciency of this
criterion, observe that, by considering the non-free actions of inertia subgroups of
the Galois covering Zi → Xi , it follows immediately that this criterion implies
that all of the inertia groups arising from irreducible components and cusps of
the geometric special ﬁber of a stable model of Xi are trivial, hence [cf., e.g.,
[SGA2], X, 3.4, (i); [Tama2], Lemma 2.1, (iii)] that the covering Zi → Xi extends
to an admissible covering of the respective stable models. On the other hand, once
one knows that the covering Zi → Xi admits such an admissible extension, the
suﬃciency of this criterion is immediate. This completes the proof of the claim.
Now assertion (ii) follows immediately, by applying the functorial isomorphisms of
semi-graphs of assertion (i).

Section 3: Absolute Open Homomorphisms of Local Galois Groups
In the present §, we give various generalizations of the main result of [Mzk1]
concerning isomorphisms between Galois groups of MLF’s. One aspect of these
generalizations is the substitution of the condition given in [Mzk1] for such an
isomorphism to arise geometrically — a condition that involves the higher ramiﬁcation ﬁltration — by various other conditions [cf. Theorem 3.5]. Certain of
these conditions were motivated by a recent result of A. Tamagawa [cf. Remark
3.8.1] concerning Lubin-Tate groups and abelian varieties with complex multiplication; other conditions [cf. Corollary 3.7] were motivated by a certain application of
the theory of the present §3 to be discussed in [Mzk15]. Another aspect of these
generalizations is that certain of the conditions studied below allow one to prove
a “Hom-version” [i.e., involving open homomorphisms, as opposed to just isomorphisms — cf. Theorem 3.5] of the main result of [Mzk1]. Finally, this Hom-version
of the main result of [Mzk1] implies certain semi-absolute Hom-versions [cf. Corollary 3.8, 3.9 below] of the absolute Isom-version of the Grothendieck Conjecture
given in [Mzk13], §2, and the relative Hom-version of the Grothendieck Conjecture
for function ﬁelds given in [Mzk3], Theorem B.

We begin by reviewing some well-known facts.
Proposition 3.2.
(Characterization of Hodge-Tate Characters) Let ρ :
×
Gk → E be a character; write Vρ for the Gk -module obtained by letting Gk act
on E via ρ. Then ρ is Hodge-Tate if and only if
χnσ σ

ρ≡
σ∈Emb(E,k)

for some nσ ∈ Z. Moreover, in this case, we have an isomorphism of 
k[Gk ]-modules:
k∼
Vρ ⊗Qp 
=


k(nσ )
σ∈Emb(E,k)

[where the “(−)” denotes a Tate twist].
Proof. Indeed, this criterion for the character ρ to be Hodge-Tate is precisely the
content of [Serre3], III, §A.5, Corollary. The Hodge-Tate decomposition of Vρ then
follows immediately the Hodge-Tate decomposition of “Vρ ” in the case where one
takes “ρ” to be χσ [cf. [Serre3], III, §A.5, proof of Lemma 2].
Proposition 3.3.
(Characterization of Quasi-Lubin-Tate Characters)
Let ρ, Vρ be as in Proposition 3.2. Then the following conditions on ρ are equivalent:
(i) ρ is of qLT-type.



(ii) We have an isomorphism of 
k[Gk ]-modules: Vρ ⊗Qp 
k∼
= k(1) ⊕ k ⊕ . . . ⊕ k.
(iii) ρ is of ICD-type and Hodge-Tate; the resulting nσ ’s of Proposition 3.2
are ∈ {0, 1}.
(iv) ρ is of ICD-type and of 01-type.
Proof. The fact that (i) implies (ii) follows immediately from the description of
the Hodge-Tate decomposition of “Vρ ” in the case where one takes “ρ” to be χσ
[cf. [Serre3], III, §A.5, proof of Lemma 2]. Next, let us assume that (ii), (iii), or
(iv) holds. In either of these cases, it follows that ρ, hence also the determinant
det(ρ) : Gk → Q×
p of ρ, is Hodge-Tate. Then by applying Proposition 3.2 to ρ, we
obtain that the associated nσ ’s are ∈ {0, 1}; by applying Proposition 3.2 to det(ρ)
[in which case one takes “E” to be Qp ], we obtain that det(ρ) is inertially equivalent
to the ( σ nσ )-th power of χcyclo
. But this allows one to conclude [either from
k
the explicit Hodge-Tate decomposition of (ii), or from the assumption that ρ is
of ICD-type in (iii), (iv)] that σ nσ = 1, hence that there exists precisely one
σ ∈ Emb(E, k) such that nσ = 1, nσ = 0 for σ  = σ. Thus, [sorting through the
deﬁnitions] we conclude that (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) hold. This completes the proof
of Proposition 3.3.

a semi-absolute [or, equivalently, pre-semi-absolute — cf. Proposition 2.5,
(iii)] homomorphism that lifts φ. Suppose that Π2 is of A-qLT-type. Then φ is
geometric.
Proof. First, we observe that by Proposition 3.4, it follows that p1 = p2 ; write
def
p = p1 = p2 . Also, we may always assume without loss of generality that φ is
surjective. Thus, by Proposition 3.4, it follows that φ(Ik1 ) = Ik2 . In the following,
we will use a superscript “Gki ” [where i = 1, 2] to denote the submodule of Gki invariants of a Gki -module.
Next, we consider assertion (i). First, we observe that it is immediate that
condition (d) implies condition (a). Next, let us suppose that condition (a) holds.
Gki
Since k = 
k
is ﬁnite-dimensional over Q , it follows that, for i = 1, 2, any G i

module M which is ﬁnite-dimensional over Qp is Hodge-Tate with weights ∈ {0, 1}

[where the tensor products are over Qp ]. Now suppose that M is a Gk2 -module
that arises as a “Vρ ” for some character ρ : Gk2 → E × of qLT-type [so M is
Hodge-Tate with weights ∈ {0, 1} — cf. Proposition 3.3, (i) =⇒ (iv)]; write Mφ for
the Gk1 -module Mφ obtained by composing the Gk2 -action on M with φ. Thus,
it follows immediately from our assumption that φ is of CHT-type that the above
condition concerning Qp -dimensions for M implies the above condition concerning
Qp -dimensions for Mφ . Applying this argument to corresponding open subgroups
of Gk1 , Gk2 thus shows that φ is of 01-qLT-type, i.e., that condition (b) holds.

Next, let us assume that condition (b) holds. First, I claim that χcyclo

φ. Indeed, by condition (b), it follows that the character χk2 ◦ φ : Gk1 → Qp is
n
of 01-type. Thus, by Proposition 3.2, we conclude that χcyclo
◦ φ ≡ (χcyclo
k2
k1 ) , for
some n ∈ {0, 1}. On the other hand, the restriction of χcyclo
to Ik2 clearly has open
k2
image; since φ(Ik1 ) = Ik2 , it thus follows that the restriction of χcyclo
◦ φ to Ik1 has
k2
open image. This rules out the possibility that n = 0, hence completes the proof
of the claim. Now, by applying this claim, together with Proposition 3.3, (i) ⇐⇒
(iv), we conclude that φ is of qLT-type, i.e., that condition (c) holds.
Next, let us assume that condition (c) holds. First, I claim that this already
implies that φ is injective [i.e., an isomorphism]. Indeed, let γ ∈ Ker(φ) ⊆ Gk1 be
such that γ = 1. Then there exists an open subgroup J1 ⊆ Gk1 ⊆ GQp satisfying
the following conditions: (1) γ ∈
/ J1 ; (2) J1 is characteristic as a subgroup GQp ; (3)
the extension E of Qp determined by J1 contains all Qp -conjugates of k2 . Fix an
embedding σ0 : k2 → E; write H2 ⊆ Gk2 for the corresponding open subgroup. Let
H1 ⊆ J1 ⊆ Gk1 be an open subgroup which is normal in Gk1 such that φ(H1 ) ⊆
H2 ; for i = 1, 2, write kHi for the extension of ki determined by Hi . Thus, the
embedding σ2 : E → kH2 given by the identity E = kH2 (respectively, σ1 : E → kH1
determined by the inclusion H1 ⊆ J1 ) determines a character ρ2 : H2 → E ×
(respectively, ρ1 : H1 → E × ) of qLT-type [i.e., the character “χσ2 ” (respectively,
“χσ1 ”)]. Moreover, by condition (c), the character ρ2 ◦ (φ|H1 ) : H1 → E × is of qLTtype, hence is inertially equivalent to τ ◦ ρ1 : H1 → E × for some τ ∈ Gal(E/Qp ). In

40

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

particular, by replacing σ2 by σ2 ◦ τ −1 , we may assume that τ is the identity, hence
that ρ2 ◦ (φ|H1 ) ≡ ρ1 . On the other hand, since γ ∈
/ J1 , hence acts nontrivially on
the subﬁeld E ⊆ kH1 [relative to the embedding σ1 ], it follows that ρ1 ◦ κγ ≡ δ ◦ ρ1 ,
where we write κγ for the automorphism of H1 given by conjugating by γ, and
δ ∈ Gal(E/Qp ) is not equal to the identity. But since φ(γ) = 1 ∈ Gk2 , we thus
conclude that δ ◦ ρ1 ≡ ρ1 ◦ κγ ≡ ρ2 ◦ (φ|H1 ) ◦ κγ ≡ ρ2 ◦ (φ|H1 ) ≡ ρ1 , which [since
ρ1 has open image] contradicts the fact that δ ∈ Gal(E/Qp ) is not equal to the
identity. This completes the proof of the claim. Thus, we may assume that φ is
an isomorphism of qLT-type, i.e., we are, in eﬀect, in the situation of [Mzk1], §4.
In particular, the fact that φ is geometric, i.e., that condition (d) holds, follows
immediately via the argument of [Mzk1], §4. This completes the proof of assertion
(i).
Next, we consider assertion (ii). Since φ is an isomorphism, it follows [cf.
[Mzk1], Proposition 1.1; [Mzk6], Proposition 1.2.1, (vi)] that χcyclo
= χcyclo
◦ φ. In
k1
k2
particular, φ is of HT-type if and only if φ is of CHT-type. Thus, assertion (ii)
follows from the equivalence of (a), (d) in assertion (i).
Finally, we consider assertion (iii). First, let us recall that by a well-known
result of Tate [cf. [Tate], §4, Corollary 2], if J ⊆ Π1 is an open subgroup with image

def
ab
⊗ Qp is always
JG ⊆ Gk1 and intersection JΔ = J Δ1 , then the JG -module JΔ
Hodge-Tate with weights ∈ {0, 1}. Thus, the condition that Π2 is of A-qLT-type
implies that φ is of 01-qLT-type, hence, by assertion (i), geometric. This completes
the proof of assertion (iii).
Deﬁnition 3.6.
(i) If H ⊆ Gk is an open subgroup corresponding to an extension ﬁeld kH of
k, then by local class ﬁeld theory [cf., e.g., [Serre2]], we have a natural isomorphism
∼

Ok×H → Tor(H)

— where we write Tor(H) [i.e., the “toral portion of H”] for the image of Ik H
in H ab . Thus, by applying the p-adic logarithm Ok×H → kH , we obtain a natural
∼
isomorphism λH : Tor(H) ⊗ Qp → kH .
(ii) We shall refer to a collection {NH }H , where H ranges over a collection of
open subgroups of Gk that form a basis of the topology of Gk , as a uniformly toral
neighborhood of Gk if there exist nonnegative integers a, b [which are independent
of H!] such that [in the notation of (i)] NH ⊆ Tor(H) ⊗ Qp is an open subgroup
such that pa · OkH ⊆ λH (NH ) ⊆ p−b · OkH ⊆ kH .
∼

(iii) Let φ : Gk1 → Gk2 be an isomorphism of proﬁnite groups. Then we shall
say that φ is uniformly toral if Gk1 admits a uniformly toral neighborhood {NH }H
def

such that {Nφ(H) = φ(NH )}φ(H) forms a uniformly toral neighborhood of Gk2 . We
shall say that φ is RF-preserving [i.e., “ramiﬁcation ﬁltration preserving”] if φ is
compatible with the ﬁltrations on Gk1 , Gk2 given by the [positively indexed] higher
ramiﬁcation groups in the upper numbering [cf., [Mzk1], Theorem].

Corollary 3.7.
(Uniform Torality and Geometricity) In the situation
of Theorem 3.5, suppose further that φ is an isomorphism. Then the following
conditions on φ are equivalent: (a) φ is RF-preserving; (b) φ is uniformly
toral; (c) φ is geometric.
Proof. First, we observe that by Proposition 3.4, it follows that p1 = p2 ; write
def
p = p1 = p2 . Also, we observe that it is immediate that condition (c) implies
condition (a). Next, we recall that the fact that condition (a) implies condition
(b) is precisely the content of the discussion preceding [Mzk1], Proposition 2.2.
That is to say, for i = 1, 2, the images of appropriate higher ramiﬁcation groups
in Tor(H) ⊗ Qp [for open subgroups H ⊆ Gki ] multiplied by appropriate integral
powers of p yield a uniformly toral neighborhood of Gki that is compatible with φ
whenever φ is RF-preserving.
i
Next, let us assume that condition (b) holds. For i = 1, 2, let {NH
}H be
a uniformly toral neighborhood of Gki . Again, we take the point of view of the
discussion preceding [Mzk1], Proposition 2.2. That is to say, we think of k i as the
inductive limit
def
Ii = lim
−→ Tor(H) ⊗ Qp
H

i
— where H ranges over the open subgroups ⊆ Gki involved in {NH
}H ; the morphisms in the inductive system are those induced by the Verlagerung, or transfer,
i
map. Write Ni ⊆ Ii for the subgroup generated by the NH
⊆ Tor(H) ⊗ Qp . Then
∼
relative to the isomorphism [of abstract modules!] λi : Ii → k i determined by the
λH ’s, we have
pa · Oki ⊆ λi (Ni ) ⊆ p−b · Oki ⊆ k i

for some nonnegative integers a, b [cf. Deﬁnition 3.6, (ii)]. In particular, it follows
that the topology on Ii determined by the submodules pc · Ni , where c ≥ 0 is an
integer, coincides, relative to λi , with the p-adic topology on k i [i.e., the topology
determined by the pc · Oki , where c ≥ 0 is an integer]. Write Ii for the completion
of Ii relative to the topology determined by the pc · Ni . Thus, λi determines an
∼
k i . In particular, the assumption that
isomorphism of topological Gki -modules Ii → 
φ is uniformly toral implies that φ is of HT-type. Thus, by Theorem 3.5, (ii), we
conclude that φ is geometric, i.e., that condition (c) holds. This completes the proof
of Corollary 3.7.
Remark 3.7.1. In fact, one veriﬁes immediately that the argument applied in the
proof of Corollary 3.7 implies that the equivalences of Corollary 3.7 [as well as the
deﬁnitions of Deﬁnition 3.6] continue to hold when φ is replaced by an isomorphism
of proﬁnite groups between the maximal pro-p quotients of the Gki . We leave the
routine details to the reader.

(iii)] homomorphism that lifts a homomorphism φ : G1 → G2 . Suppose further
that X2 is a hyperbolic orbicurve, that p2 ∈ Σ2 , and that one of the following
conditions holds:
(a) φ is of CHT-type;
(b) φ is of 01-qLT-type;
(c) φ is of qLT-type;
(d) φ is an isomorphism of HT-type;
(e) φ is a uniformly toral isomorphism;
(f ) φ is an RF-preserving isomorphism;
(g) Π2 is of A-qLT-type.
(h) φ is geometric;
Then ψ is geometric, i.e., arises [relative to the αi ] from a unique dominant
morphism of schemes X1 → X2 lying over a morphism Spec(k1 ) → Spec(k2 ).
Proof. Indeed, by Theorem 3.5, (i), (ii), (iii); Corollary 3.7, it follows that any of
the conditions (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h) implies condition (h). Thus, since
X2 is a hyperbolic orbicurve, and p2 ∈ Σ2 , the fact that ψ is geometric follows from
[Mzk3], Theorem A.
Remark 3.8.1. One important motivation for the theory of the present §3 is the
following result, orally communicated to the author by A. Tamagawa:
(∗A-qLT ) Let X be a hyperbolic orbicurve over k that admits a ﬁnite étale covering
Y → X by a hyperbolic curve Y such that Y admits a dominant kmorphism Y → P , where P is the projective line minus three points
over k [i.e., a tripod — cf. §0]. Then the arithmetic fundamental group
π1 (X)  Gk of X is of A-qLT-type.
In particular, it follows that:
Corollary 3.8 may be applied [in the sense that condition (g) is satisﬁed]
whenever X2 satisﬁes the conditions placed on the hyperbolic orbicurve
“X” of (∗A-qLT ).
Indeed, Tamagawa’s original motivation for considering (∗A-qLT ) was precisely the
goal of applying the methods of [Mzk1] to obtain an “isomorphism version” of
Corollary 3.8, (g). Upon learning of these ideas of Tamagawa, the author proceeded

TOPICS IN ABSOLUTE ANABELIAN GEOMETRY I

43

to re-examine the theory of [Mzk1]. This led the author to the discovery of the
various generalizations of [Mzk1] — and, in particular, the Hom-version of Corollary
3.8, (g) — given in the present §3. Tamagawa derives (∗A-qLT ) from the following
result:
(∗CM ) Given a character ρ : Gk → E × of qLT-type, there exists an abelian
variety with complex multiplication A over some ﬁnite extension kA of k
such that ρ|GkA is inertially equivalent to some character whose associated
GkA -module appears as a subquotient of the GkA -module given by the padic Tate module of A.
Indeed, to derive (∗A-qLT ) from (∗CM ), one reasons as follows: Every abelian variety
with complex multiplication A is deﬁned over a number ﬁeld, hence arises as a
quotient of a Jacobian of a smooth proper curve Z over a number ﬁeld. Moreover,
by considering Belyi maps, it follows that some open subscheme UZ ⊆ Z arises as
a ﬁnite étale covering of the projective line minus three points. Thus, any Galois
module that appears as a subquotient of the p-adic Tate module of A also appears
as a subquotient of the p-adic Tate module of the Jacobian of some ﬁnite étale
covering of the curve P of (∗A-qLT ), hence, a fortiori, as a subquotient of the p-adic
Tate module of the Jacobian of some ﬁnite étale covering of the curves Y , X of
(∗A-qLT ). Thus, we conclude that π1 (X) is of A-qLT-type, as desired.
Corollary 3.9.
(Geometricity of Strictly Semi-absolute Homomorphisms for Function Fields) Assume that either of the results (∗A-qLT ), (∗CM ) of
Remark 3.8.1 holds. For i = 1, 2, let ki be an MLF, Ki a function ﬁeld of transcendence degree ≥ 1 over ki [so ki is algebraically closed in Ki ], K i an algebraic
def

closure of Ki , k i the algebraic closure of ki determined by K i , Πi = Gal(K i /Ki ),
def

def

Gi = Gal(k i /ki ), Δi = Ker(Πi  Gi ). Then every open homomorphism
ψ : Π1 → Π2
that induces an open homomorphism ψΔ : Δ1 → Δ2 [hence also an open homomorphism φ : G1 → G2 ] is geometric, i.e., arises from a unique embedding of ﬁelds
K2 → K1 that induces an embedding of ﬁelds k2 → k1 of ﬁnite degree.
Proof. Since every function ﬁeld of transcendence degree ≥ 1 over k2 contains the
function ﬁeld of a tripod over k2 , it follows from (∗A-qLT ), hence also from (∗CM )
[cf. Remark 3.8.1], that there exists a hyperbolic curve X over k2 whose function
def

ﬁeld is contained in K2 such that if we write Π2  Π3 = π1 (X) for the resulting
surjection, then Π3 is of A-qLT-type. Now we wish to apply a “birational analogue”
of Corollary 3.8, (g), to the composite homomorphism Π1 → Π2  Π3 [where the
ﬁrst arrow is ψ].
To verify that such an analogue holds, it suﬃces to verify that φ is of 01-qLTdef
def
type [cf. Theorem 3.5, (i), (b) =⇒ (d)]. To this end, set k3 = k2 , G3 = G2 ,
def

Δ3 = Ker(Π3  G3 ); let us suppose, for i = 1, 3, that Hi ⊆ Δi , Ji ⊆ Gi
are characteristic open subgroups such that ψΔ (H1 ) ⊆ H3 , φ(J1 ) ⊆ J3 . Thus, if

44

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

we write p for the common residue characteristic of k1 , k3 [cf. Proposition 3.4],
then we obtain a surjection H1ab ⊗ Qp  H3ab ⊗ Qp that is compatible with φ.
Moreover, it follows immediately from Corollary A.11 [cf. also Proposition A.3,
(v)] of the Appendix that the J1 -module H1ab-t ⊗ Zp admits a quotient J1 -module
H1ab-t ⊗ Zp  Q1 such that Q1 is the p-adic Tate module of some abelian variety
over a ﬁnite extension of k1 , and, moreover, the kernel Ker(H1ab-t ⊗ Zp  Q1 ) is
topologically generated by topologically cyclic subgroups [i.e., “copies of Zp ”] on
which some open subgroup of J1 [which may depend on the cyclic subgroup] acts via
the cyclotomic character. Next, let us observe that if V3 is any J3 -module associated
to a character of qLT-type of dimension ≥ 2, then V3 does not contain any sub-J3 modules of dimension 1 over Qp . From this observation, it follows immediately that
any subquotient [cf. Deﬁnition 3.1, (v)] of the J3 -module H3ab ⊗Qp that is isomorphic
to the J3 -module associated to a character of qLT-type of dimension ≥ 2 determines
a subquotient [not only of the J1 -module H1ab-t ⊗ Qp , but also] of the J1 -module
Q1 ⊗ Qp . Thus, we conclude that any such subquotient of the J1 -module Q1 ⊗ Qp
is Hodge-Tate with weights ∈ {0, 1}. Moreover, by considering determinants of such
subquotients, one concludes that the pull-back of the cyclotomic character J3 → Z×
p
is a character J1 → Z×
p which is Hodge-Tate, and whose unique weight w is ≥ 0. If
w ≥ 2, then the fact that the J3 -module determined by the cyclotomic character of
J3 occurs as a subquotient of H3ab ⊗ Qp [for suﬃciently small H3 ], hence determines
a J1 -module that occurs as a subquotient [not only of the J1 -module H1ab-t ⊗ Qp ,
but also, in light of our assumption that w ≥ 2!] of the J1 -module Q1 ⊗ Qp leads to
a contradiction [since the J1 -module Q1 ⊗ Qp is Hodge-Tate with weights ∈ {0, 1}].
Thus, we conclude that φ : G1 → G2 = G3 is of 01-qLT-type, hence geometric,
i.e., arises from a unique embedding of ﬁelds k2 → k1 of ﬁnite degree. Finally,
the geometricity of φ implies that the geometricity of ψ may be derived from the
“relative” result given in [Mzk3], Theorem B.
Remark 3.9.1. The proof given above of Corollary 3.9 shows that the “Π2 ” of
Corollary 3.9 may, in fact, be taken to be a “Π2 ” as in Corollary 3.8, (g).

Section 4: Chains of Elementary Operations
In the present §4, we generalize [cf. Theorems 4.7, 4.12; Remarks 4.7.1, 4.12.1
below] the theory of “categories of dominant localizations” discussed in [Mzk9],
§2 [cf. also the tempered versions of these categories, discussed in [Mzk10], §6],
to include “localizations” obtained by more general “chains of elementary operations” — i.e., the operations of passing to a ﬁnite étale covering, passing to a ﬁnite
étale quotient, “de-cuspidalization”, and “de-orbiﬁcation” [cf. Deﬁnition 4.2 below;
[Mzk13], §2] — which are applied to some given algebraic stack over a ﬁeld. The
ﬁeld and algebraic stack under consideration are quite general in nature [by comparison, e.g., to the theory of [Mzk9], §2; [Mzk13], §2], but are subject to various
assumptions. One key assumption asserts that the algebraic stack satisﬁes a certain
relative version of the “Grothendieck Conjecture”.
Before proceeding, we recall the following immediate consequence of [Mzk13],
Lemma 2.1; [Mzk12], Proposition 1.2, (ii).
Lemma 4.1.
(Decomposition Groups of Hyperbolic Orbicurves) Let Σ
be a nonempty set of prime numbers, Δ a pro-Σ group of GFG-type that admits
base-prime [cf. Deﬁnition 2.1, (iv)] partial construction data (k, X, Σ) [consisting
of the construction data ﬁeld, construction data base-stack, and construction data
prime set] such that X is a hyperbolic orbicurve [cf. §0], and k is algebraically
closed. Let xA (respectively, xB = xA ) be either a closed point or a cusp [cf.
§0] of X; A ⊆ Δ (respectively, B ⊆ Δ) the decomposition group [well-deﬁned
up to conjugation in Δ] of xA (respectively, xB ). Then:

(i) A, B are pro-cyclic groups; A B = {1}. If xA is a closed point of
X, and A = {1}, then A is a ﬁnite, normally terminal [cf. §0] subgroup of Δ.
If xA is a cusp, then A is a torsion-free, commensurably terminal [cf. §0]
inﬁnite subgroup of Δ.
(ii) The order of every ﬁnite cyclic closed subgroup C ⊆ Δ divides the
order of X [cf. §0].
(iii) Every ﬁnite nontrivial closed subgroup C ⊆ Δ is contained in a
decomposition group of a unique closed point of X. In particular, the nontrivial decomposition groups of closed points of X may be characterized [“grouptheoretically”] as the maximal ﬁnite nontrivial closed subgroups of Δ.
(iv) X is a hyperbolic curve if and only if Δ is torsion-free.
(v) Suppose that the quotient ψA : Δ  ΔA of Δ by the closed normal subgroup of Δ topologically generated by A is slim and nontrivial. If xA is a closed
point of X (respectively, a cusp), then we suppose further that Σ = Primes [which
forces the characteristic of k to be zero] (respectively, that A ⊆ J for some normal
open torsion-free subgroup J of Δ). Then ΔA is a proﬁnite group of GFG-type
that admits base-prime partial construction data (k, XA , Σ) [consisting of the construction data ﬁeld, construction data base-stack, and construction data prime set]
such that XA is a hyperbolic orbicurve equipped with a dominant k-morphism
φA : X → XA that is uniquely determined [up to a unique isomorphism] by the

46

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

property that it induces [up to composition with an inner automorphism] ψA . Moreover, if xA is a closed point of X (respectively, a cusp), then φA is a partial
coarsiﬁcation morphism [cf. §0] which is an isomorphism either over XA or
over the complement in XA of the point of XA determined by xA (respectively, is an
open immersion whose image is the complement of the point of XA determined
by xA ).
(vi) In the notation of (v), if B = {1}, then ψA (B) = {1}.
Proof. First, we recall that by the deﬁnition of a proﬁnite group of GFG-type
[cf. the discussion at the beginning of §2], it follows that there exists a normal
open subgroup H ⊆ Δ such that if we write XH → X for the corresponding
Galois covering, then XH is a hyperbolic curve. Next, let us observe that, in light
of our assumption that the partial construction data is base-prime, we may lift
the entire situation to characteristic zero, hence assume, at least for the proof of
assertions (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), that k is of characteristic zero. Thus, assertions (i),
(ii), (iii) when xA , xB are closed points (respectively, cusps) of X follow immediately
from [Mzk13], Lemma 2.1 (respectively, [Mzk12], Proposition 1.2, (ii)). Next, we
consider assertion (iv). First, we observe that the necessity portion of assertion
(iv) follows immediately from assertion (iii). To verify suﬃciency, let us suppose
that Δ is torsion-free. Let π1tame (X)  Δ be a scheme-theoretic envelope of Δ.
Then since XH is a scheme, it follows that the nontrivial [ﬁnite closed] subgroups
of π1tame (X) that arise as decomposition groups of closed points map injectively,
via the composite surjection π1tame (X)  Δ  Δ/H, into Δ/H, hence, a fortiori,
injectively via the surjection π1tame (X)  Δ, into Δ [which is torsion-free]. Thus,
the decomposition groups in π1 (X) = π1tame (X) [cf. our assumption that k is
algebraically closed of characteristic zero] of closed points of X are trivial. But this
implies [by considering, for instance, the Galois covering XH → X] that X is a
scheme, as desired. This completes the proof of assertion (iv).
Next, we consider assertion (v). First, let us observe that XA admits a ﬁnite
étale covering YA → XA arising from a normal open subgroup of ΔA such that YA is
a curve, which will necessarily be hyperbolic, in light of the slimness and nontriviality
of ΔA . Indeed, when xA is a closed point of X [so Σ = Primes; k is of characteristic
zero], this follows immediately from the equivalence of deﬁnitions of a “hyperbolic
orbicurve” discussed in §0; when xA is a cusp, this follows from assertion (iv) and
our assumption of the existence of the subgroup J ⊆ Δ. Now the remainder of
assertion (v) follows immediately from the deﬁnitions. This completes the proof of
assertion (v). Finally, we consider assertion (vi). Assertion (vi) is immediate if xB
is a cusp [cf. assertion (i)]; thus, we may assume that xB is a closed point of X.
If ψA (B) = {1}, then it follows that the decomposition group ⊆ ΔA of the image
of xB in XA is trivial. Since [by assertion (v)] XA admits a ﬁnite étale covering
YA → XA arising from an open subgroup of ΔA such that YA is a hyperbolic curve,
we thus conclude that XA is scheme-like in a neighborhood of the image of xB in
XA , hence [in light of the explicit description of the morphism φA in the statement
of assertion (v)] that X is scheme-like in a neighborhood of xB . But this implies
that B = {1}. This completes the proof of assertion (vi).
Remark 4.1.1. Note that Lemma 4.1, (iv), is false if we only assume that Δ is
almost pro-Σ. Indeed, such an example may be constructed by taking X to be a

hyperbolic curve over an algebraically closed ﬁeld k of characteristic zero, Y → X a
ﬁnite étale Galois covering of degree prime to Σ, and Δ to be the quotient of π1 (X)
by the kernel of the surjection (π1 (X) ⊇) π1 (Y )  π1 (Y )(Σ) to the maximal pro-Σ
quotient π1 (Y )(Σ) of π1 (Y ). Then for any prime p dividing the order of Gal(Y /X)
[so p ∈ Σ], it follows by considering Sylow p-subgroups that Δ contains an element
of order p, despite the fact that X is a curve.
Deﬁnition 4.2.

Let G be a slim proﬁnite group;
1→Δ→Π→G→1

an extension of GSAFG-type that admits base-prime partial construction data
(k, X, Σ), where Σ = ∅; α : π1tame (X)  Π is a scheme-theoretic envelope. Thus, if
we write π1tame (X)  Gk for the quotient given by the absolute Galois group Gk

for the pro-ﬁnite étale covering of X determined by the surjection α; k for the

resulting ﬁeld extension of k. In a similar vein, we shall write Π
system of proﬁnite groups determined by the open subgroups of Π. [Thus, one

Here, an elementary operation “Xj  Xj+1 ” is deﬁned to consist of the datum of
a dominant “operation morphism” φ either from Xj to Xj+1 or from Xj+1 to Xj
which is compatible with ρj , ρj+1 , and, moreover, is of one of the following four
types:
(a) Type : In this case, the elementary operation Xj  Xj+1 consists of
a ﬁnite étale covering φ : Xj+1 → Xj . Thus, φ determines an open
immersion of proﬁnite groups Πj+1 → Πj .
(b) Type : In this case, the elementary operation Xj  Xj+1 consists of a
ﬁnite étale morphism φ : Xj → Xj+1 — i.e., a “ﬁnite étale quotient”.
Thus, φ determines an open immersion of proﬁnite groups Πj → Πj+1 .
(c) Type •: This type of elementary operation is only deﬁned if X is a
hyperbolic orbicurve. In this case, the elementary operation Xj  Xj+1
consists of an open immersion φ : Xj → Xj+1 [so kj = kj+1 ] — i.e., a
“de-cuspidalization” — such that the image of φ is the complement
of a single kj+1 -valued point of Xj+1 whose decomposition group in Δj
is contained in some normal open torsion-free subgroup of Δj . Thus, φ
determines a surjection of proﬁnite groups Πj  Πj+1 .
(d) Type : This type of elementary operation is only deﬁned if X is a
hyperbolic orbicurve and Σ = Primes [which forces the characteristic of k
to be zero]. In this case, the elementary operation Xj  Xj+1 consists
of a partial coarsiﬁcation morphism [cf. §0] φ : Xj → Xj+1 [so kj =
kj+1 ] — i.e., a “de-orbiﬁcation” — such that φ is an isomorphism over
the complement in Xj+1 of some kj+1 -valued point of Xj+1 . Thus, φ
determines a surjection of proﬁnite groups Πj  Πj+1 .

Thus, any X/X-chain
determines a sequence of symbols ∈ {, , •, } [correspond
ing to the types of elementary operations in the X/X-chain],
which we shall refer

to as the type-chain associated to the X/X-chain.

morphisms implies that every automorphism of an X/X-chain
is given by the iden
tity, and that every isomorphism of X/X-chains is compatible with the respective

an open immersion of proﬁnite groups φ : Πj → Πj+1 .
(c) Type •: This type of elementary operation is only deﬁned if X is a

consists of a surjection of proﬁnite groups φ : Πj  Πj+1 , such that Ker(φ)
is topologically normally generated by a cuspidal decomposition group C
in Δj such that C is contained in some normal open torsion-free subgroup
of Δj .
(d) Type : This type of elementary operation is only deﬁned if X is a
hyperbolic orbicurve and Σ = Primes [which forces the characteristic of k
to be zero]. In this case, the elementary operation Πj  Πj+1 consists
of a surjection of proﬁnite groups φ : Πj  Πj+1 , such that Ker(φ) is
topologically normally generated by a ﬁnite closed subgroup of Δj .
Thus, any Π-chain determines a sequence of symbols ∈ {, , •, } [corresponding
to the types of elementary operations in the Π-chain], which we shall refer to as the
type-chain associated to the Π-chain.

j = 0, . . . , n] that are compatible with the rigidifying homomorphisms. [Here, we
note that the condition of compatibility with the rigidifying homomorphisms implies
[since all of the proﬁnite groups involved are slim] that every automorphism of a Πchain is given by the identity, and that every isomorphism of Π-chains is compatible
with the respective operation homomorphisms.] Thus, one obtains a category
Chain(Π)
whose objects are the Π-chains [with arbitrary associated type-chain], and whose
morphisms are the isomorphisms between Π-chains [with identical type-chains].
A terminal homomorphism between two Π-chains [with arbitrary associated typechains]

is deﬁned to be an open outer homomorphism Πn → Ψm that is compatible [up to
composition with an inner automorphism] with the open homomorphisms Πn → G,
Ψm → G. Thus, one obtains a category

obtain natural functors Chain(Π) → Chainiso-trm (Π) → Chaintrm (Π).
(v) We shall use the notation
Chainiso-trm (∼){−} ⊆ Chainiso-trm (∼);

Chaintrm (∼){−} ⊆ Chaintrm (∼)


— where “(∼)” is either equal to “(X/X)”
or “(Π)”, and “{−}” contains some
subset of the set of symbols {, , •, } — to denote the respective full subcategories
determined by the chains whose associated type-chain only contains the symbols
that belong to “{−}”. In particular, we shall write:

[cf. the theory of [Mzk9], §2; Remark 4.7.1 below].
Remark 4.2.1. Thus, it follows immediately from the deﬁnitions that if, in the
notation of Deﬁnition 4.2, (i),
X0  X1  . . .  Xn−1  Xn

is an X/X-chain,
then the resulting proﬁnite groups Πj determine a Π-chain
Π0  Π1  . . .  Πn−1  Πn
with the same associated type-chain. In particular, we obtain natural functors

Chain(X/X)
→ Chain(Π)

Chainiso-trm (X/X)
→ Chainiso-trm (Π);


Chaintrm (X/X)
→ Chaintrm (Π)

which are compatible with the natural functors of Deﬁnition 4.2, (ii), (iv).
Remark 4.2.2. Note that in the situation of Deﬁnition 4.2, (i), Gj is a slim
proﬁnite group; 1 → Δj → Πj → Gj → 1 is an extension of GSAFG-type that
admits base-prime partial construction data (kj , Xj , Σ), where Xj is a hyperbolic
orbicurve whenever X0 is a hyperbolic orbicurve; α, ρj determine [in light of the
slimness of Πj ] a scheme-theoretic envelope αj : π1tame (Xj )  Πj . That is to say,
we obtain, for each j, similar data to the data introduced at the beginning of
Deﬁnition 4.2. Here, relative to issue of verifying that Δj admits an open subgroup
that corresponds to a scheme-like covering of Xj , it is useful to recall, in the case
of de-cuspidalization operations, i.e., “•”, the condition [cf. Deﬁnition 4.2, (i), (c);
Deﬁnition 4.2, (iii), (c)] that the cuspidal decomposition group under consideration
be contained in a normal open torsion-free subgroup [cf. Lemma 4.1, (iv)]; in the
case of de-orbiﬁcation operations, i.e., “”, it is useful to recall the assumption
that Σ = Primes, together with the equivalence of deﬁnitions of the notion of a
“hyperbolic orbicurve” discussed in §0.

Proposition 4.3. (Re-ordering of Chains) In the notation of Deﬁnition 4.2,

suppose that Σ = Primes; let X0  . . .  Xn be an X/X-chain.
Then there

exists a terminally isomorphic X/X-chain Y0  . . .  Ym whose associated
type-chain is of the form
, •, •, . . . , •, , , , . . . , , 
— i.e., consists of the symbol , followed by a sequence of the symbols •, followed
by the symbol , followed by a sequence of the symbols , followed by the symbol
. Moreover, Ym−1 → Ym may be taken to arise from an extension of the base ﬁeld
[where we recall that this base ﬁeld will always be a ﬁnite extension of k].
Proof. Indeed, let us ﬁrst observe that by taking Ym−1 → Ym to arise from an
appropriate extension of the base ﬁeld, we may ignore the “kj -rationality” issues
that occur in Deﬁnition 4.2, (i), (c), (d). Next, let us observe that it is immediate
from the deﬁnitions that we may always “move the symbol  to the top of the typechain”. This completes the proof of Proposition 4.3 when X is not a hyperbolic
orbicurve. Thus, in the remainder of the proof, we may assume without loss of
generality that X is a hyperbolic orbicurve, and that the symbols indexed by j ≥ 1
of the type-chain are ∈ {, •, }. Next, let us observe that the operation morphisms
indexed by j ≥ 1 always have domain indexed by j and codomain indexed by j + 1.
Thus, by composing these operation morphisms, we obtain a morphism X1 →
Xn−1 . Here, we may assume, without loss of generality, that X1 is a hyperbolic
curve, and that X1 → Xn−1 induces a Galois extension of function ﬁelds and an
isomorphism of base ﬁelds. Also, we may assume that the morphism X1 → Xn−1
factors through a connected ﬁnite étale covering Z → Xn−1 , where Z is a hyperbolic
curve. Thus, by considering the extension of function ﬁelds determined by X1 →
Xn−1 , it follows immediately that Xn−1 may be obtained from X1 by applying
de-cuspidalization operations [i.e., “•”] to X1 at the cusps of X1 that map to points
of Xn−1 , then forming the stack-theoretic quotient by the action of Gal(X1 /Xn−1 )
[i.e., “”], and ﬁnally applying suitable de-orbiﬁcation [i.e., “”] operations to this
quotient to recover Xn−1 . This yields a type-chain of the desired form.
As the following example shows, the issue of permuting the symbols “”, “”
is not so straightforward.
Example 4.4. Non-permutability of Étale Quotients and De-orbiﬁcations.
In the notation of Deﬁnition 4.2, let us assume further Σ = Primes [so k is of char
acteristic zero]. Then there exists an X/X-chain
X0  X1  X2 of length 2 with
associated type-chain ∗0 , ∗1 , where ∗0 , ∗1 ∈ {, }, ∗0 = ∗1 , which is not terminally

isomorphic to any X/X-chain
Y0  Y1  Y2 of length 2 with associated type-chain
∗1 , ∗0 . Indeed:
(i) The case of type-chain , : Let X be a hyperbolic curve of type (g, r)
over k equipped with an automorphism σ of the k-scheme X of order 2 that has
precisely one ﬁxed point x ∈ X(k); X0 = X  X1 the elementary operation of type
 given by forming the stack-theoretic quotient of X by the action of σ; x1 ∈ X1 (k)
the image of x in X1 ; X1  X2 the nontrivial elementary operation of type  [i.e.,

such that the corresponding operation morphism X1 → X2 is a non-isomorphism]
determined by the point x1 ∈ X1 (k). Thus, we assume that X2 is a hyperbolic curve,
whose type we denote by (g2 , r2 ). On the other hand, since X is a scheme, any

which is unramiﬁed, of some degree d, yields equations

def

[where we write χ = 2g − 2 + r, χ2 = 2g2 − 2 + r2 ] — which imply [since d, χ,
χ2 are positive integers] that d − 2 = χ2 = 1, hence that d = 3, χ2 = 1, χ = 3. In
particular, by choosing X so that χ is > 3 [e.g., X such that g ≥ 3], we obtain a
contradiction.
(ii) The case of type-chain , : Let X be a proper hyperbolic orbicurve over
k; X → C the coarse space associated to the algebraic stack X. Let us assume
further that C is a [proper] hyperbolic curve over k; that the morphism X → C
is a non-isomorphism which restricts to an isomorphism away from some point
c ∈ C(k); and that there exists a ﬁnite étale covering  : C → D of degree 2 [so D
is also a proper hyperbolic curve over k, which is not isomorphic to C]. [It is easy
to construct such objects by starting from D and then constructing C, X.] Now
def

we take X0 = X  X1 = C to be the elementary operation of type  determined
def
by the unique point of x ∈ X(k) lying over c ∈ C(k); C = X1  X2 = D to be the
elementary operation of type  determined by the ﬁnite étale covering  : C → D.
Write ex ≥ 2 for the ramiﬁcation index of X → C at x; gD ≥ 2 for the genus of
def
D; χD = 2gD − 2 ≥ 2. On the other hand, let us suppose that Y0  Y1  Y2
∼
is a chain of length 2 with associated type-chain ,  such that X2 → Y2 over k.
∼
Then since D = X2 → Y2 is a scheme, it follows that the hyperbolic orbicurve Y1
admits a point y1 ∈ Y1 (k) such that Y1 is a scheme away from y1 . Write ey1 for
the ramiﬁcation index of the operation morphism Y1 → Y2 at y1 . Note that if Y1 is
a scheme, then the ﬁnite étale covering X = Y0 of Y1 is as well — a contradiction.
Thus, we conclude that Y1 is not a scheme at y1 , i.e., ey1 ≥ 2. Next, let us observe
that if the ﬁnite étale morphism Y0 → Y1 is not an isomorphism, i.e., of degree
d ≥ 2, then the morphisms X → C → D and X = Y0 → Y1 give rise to a relation
2χD + (ex − 1)/ex = d(χD + (ey1 − 1)/ey1 )
— i.e., 1 > (ex − 1)/ex = (d − 2)χD + d(ey1 − 1)/ey1 ≥ d(ey1 − 1)/ey1 ≥ d/2 ≥ 1,
a contradiction. Thus, we conclude that d = 1, i.e., that the operation morphism
X = Y0 → Y1 is an isomorphism. But this implies that Y2 is isomorphic to the
∼
coarse space associated to X, i.e., that we have an isomorphism Y2 → C, hence an
∼
∼
isomorphism D = X2 → Y2 → C — a contradiction.
Next, we recall the group-theoretic characterization of the cuspidal decomposition groups of a hyperbolic [orbi]curve given in [Mzk12].

this correspondence is functorial in H and compatible with the natural actions

Proof. Assertion (i) may be reduced to the case of hyperbolic curves via Lemma 4.1,

is immediate from the deﬁnitions. Assertion (iii) follows immediately from [Mzk12],
Proposition 2.4, (iv), (vii); the proof of [Mzk12], Corollary 2.7, (i). Assertion (iv) is
[in light of assertion (iii)] precisely a summary of the argument of [Mzk12], Theorem

a subset of the direct product set V × F × S, which we shall think of as a set of
collections of partial construction data. In the following discussion, we shall use
“[−]” to denote the isomorphism class of “−”. We shall say that D is chain-full if
for every extension 1 → Δ → Π → G → 1 of GSAFG-type, where G is slim, that
admits base-prime partial construction data (X, k, Σ) such that ([X], [k], Σ) ∈ D [cf.

Remark 4.6.1. Of course, in a similar vein, one may also formulate the notions
that “the absolute isomorphism version of the Grothendieck Conjecture holds for
D”, “the absolute homomorphism version of the Grothendieck Conjecture holds for
D”, “the semi-absolute isomorphism version of the Grothendieck Conjecture holds
for D”, “the semi-absolute homomorphism version of the Grothendieck Conjecture
holds for D”, etc. Since we shall not use these versions in the discussion to follow,
we leave the routine details of their formulation to the interested reader.
Theorem 4.7. (Semi-absoluteness of Chains of Elementary Operations)
Let D be a chain-full set of collections of partial construction data [cf. Definition 4.6, (i)] such that the rel-isom-DGC holds [cf. Deﬁnition 4.6, (ii)]. For
i = 1, 2, let Gi be a slim proﬁnite group;
1 → Δi → Πi → Gi → 1
an extension of GSAFG-type that admits base-prime [cf. Deﬁnition 2.1,
(iv)] partial construction data (ki , 
ki , Xi , Σi ) such that ([Xi ], [ki ], Σi ) ∈ D; αi :
tame
π1 (Xi )  Πi a scheme-theoretic envelope. Also, let us suppose further that
the following conditions are satisﬁed:
(a) if either X1 or X2 is a hyperbolic orbicurve, then both X1 and X2
are hyperbolic orbicurves;
(b) if either X1 or X2 is a non-proper
hyperbolic orbicurve, then there

exists a prime number l ∈ Σ1 Σ2 such that for i = 1, 2, the cyclotomic

Proof. First, we consider the natural functor
i /Xi ) → Chain(Πi )
Chain(X
of Remark 4.2.1. To conclude that this functor is an equivalence of categories, it
follows immediately from the deﬁnitions of the categories involved that it suﬃces to
i /Xi -chain and Πi -chain versions of the four types of elementary
verify that the X
operations , , •,  described in Deﬁnition 4.2, (i), (iii), correspond bijectively
to one another. This is immediate from the deﬁnitions (respectively, the cuspidal
portion of Lemma 4.1, (i), (v); the “closed point of X” portion of Lemma 4.1, (iii),
(v)) for  (respectively, •; ). [Here, we note that in the case of •, , the “kj+1 rationality” [in the notation of Deﬁnition 4.2, (i), (c), (d)] of the cusp or possibly
non-scheme-like point in question follows immediately from Lemma 4.1, (vi), by
taking “xB ” to be the various Galois conjugates of this point.] Finally, the desired
correspondence for  follows from our assumption that the rel-isom-DGC holds
by applying this “rel-isom-DGC” as was done in the proofs of [Mzk7], Theorem
2.4; [Mzk9], Theorem 2.3, (i). This completes the proof that the natural functor
i /Xi ) → Chain(Πi ) is an equivalence. A similar application of the “relChain(X

i /Xi ) →
isom-DGC” then yields the equivalences Chainiso-trm (X
Chainiso-trm (Πi ),

Chaintrm (Πi ),
∼
i /Xi ) → DLoc(Πi ) of assertion (iii). This completes the proof of assertions
DLoc(X
(i), (iii).
Finally, to obtain the equivalences of assertions (ii), (iv), it suﬃces to observe
that the deﬁnitions of the various categories involved are entirely “group-theoretic”.
Here, we note that the “group-theoreticity” of the elementary operations of type ,
,  is immediate; the “group-theoreticity” of the elementary operations of type
• follows immediately from Lemma 4.5, (v) [in light of our assumptions (a), (b)].
Also, we observe that whenever the Xi [for i = 1, 2] are hyperbolic orbicurves, Σi
may be recovered “group-theoretically” from Δi [i.e., as the unique minimal subset
Σ ⊆ Primes such that Δi is almost pro-Σ ]. This completes the proof of assertions
(ii), (iv).
Remark 4.7.1. The portion of Theorem 4.7 concerning the categories “ÉtLoc(−)”
[cf. also Example 4.8 below; Corollary 2.8, (ii)] and “DLoc(−)” allows one to relate
the theory of the present §4 to the theory of [Mzk9], §2 [cf., especially, [Mzk9],
Theorem 2.3].
Example 4.8.
Hyperbolic Orbicurves. Let p be a prime number; S the set
of subsets of Primes containing p; V the set of isomorphism classes of hyperbolic
orbicurves over ﬁelds of cardinality ≤ the cardinality of Qp .
(i) Let F be the set of isomorphism classes of generalized sub-p-adic ﬁelds [i.e.,
subﬁelds of ﬁnitely generated extensions of the quotient ﬁeld of the ring of Witt
vectors with coeﬃcients in an algebraic closure of Fp — cf. [Mzk5], Deﬁnition 4.11];
D = V × F × S. Then let us observe that:
The hypotheses of Theorem 4.7, (i), (ii), are satisﬁed relative to this D.
Indeed, it is immediate that D is chain-full; the rel-isom-DGC follows from [Mzk5],
Theorem 4.12; the prime p clearly serves as a prime “l” as in the statement of
Theorem 4.7. Moreover, we recall from [Mzk5], Lemma 4.14, that the absolute
Galois group of a generalized sub-p-adic ﬁeld is always slim.
(ii) Let F be the set of isomorphism classes of sub-p-adic ﬁelds [i.e., subﬁelds of
ﬁnitely generated extensions of Qp — cf. [Mzk3], Deﬁnition 15.4, (i)]; D = V×F×S.
Then let us observe that:
The hypotheses of Theorem 4.7, (iii), (iv), are satisﬁed relative to this D.
Indeed, it is immediate that D is chain-full; the rel-hom-DGC follows from [Mzk3],
Theorem A; the prime p clearly serves as a prime “l” as in the statement of Theorem
4.7. Moreover, we recall from [Mzk3], Lemma 15.8, that the absolute Galois group
of a sub-p-adic ﬁeld is always slim.

Iso-poly-hyperbolic Orbisurfaces.

(i) Let k be a ﬁeld of characteristic zero. Then we recall from [Mzk3], Deﬁnition
a2.1, that a smooth k-scheme X is called a hyperbolically ﬁbred surface if it admits
the structure of a family of hyperbolic curves [cf. §0] over a hyperbolic curve Y
over k. If X is a smooth, generically scheme-like, geometrically connected algebraic
stack over k, then we shall say that X is an iso-poly-hyperbolic orbisurface [cf. the
term “poly-hyperbolic” as it is deﬁned in [Mzk4], Deﬁnition 4.6] if X admits a ﬁnite
étale covering which is a hyperbolically ﬁbred surface over some ﬁnite extension of
k.
def

(ii) Let p be a prime number; S = {Primes} [where we regard Primes as the
unique non-proper subset of Primes]; F the set of isomorphism classes of sub-p-adic
ﬁelds; V the set of isomorphism classes of iso-poly-hyperbolic orbisurfaces [cf. (i)]
over sub-p-adic ﬁelds; D = V × F × S. Then let us observe that:
The hypotheses of Theorem 4.7, (i), (ii), are satisﬁed relative to this D.
Indeed, it is immediate that D is chain-full; the rel-isom-DGC, as well as the slimness of the Δi [for i = 1, 2], follows immediately from [Mzk3], Theorem D. Moreover,
we recall from [Mzk3], Lemma 15.8, that the absolute Galois group of a sub-p-adic
ﬁeld is always slim.
(iii) Let k be a sub-p-adic ﬁeld; X the moduli stack of hyperbolic curves of type
(0, 5) [i.e., the moduli stack of smooth curves of genus 0 with 5 distinct, unordered
 → X a “universal” pro-ﬁnite étale covering of X; k the algebraic
points] over k; X
 → X. Then one veriﬁes immediately that X is an
closure of k determined by X
iso-poly-hyperbolic orbisurface over k. Write 1 → Δ → Π → G → 1 for the GSAFG
extension deﬁned by the natural surjection π1 (X) = Gal(X/X)
 Gal(k/k) [which
we regard as equipped with the tautological scheme-theoretic envelope given by the


identity] and Loc(X/X)
⊆ Chaintrm (X/X)
(respectively, Loc(Π) ⊆ Chaintrm (Π))
for the subcategory determined by the terminal morphisms (respectively, homomorphisms) which are ﬁnite étale (respectively, injective). Then it follows immediately
from (ii); Theorem 4.7, (i), that we have an equivalence of categories
∼


Loc(X/X)
→ Loc(Π)
[cf. [Mzk7], Theorem 2.4; [Mzk9], Theorem 2.3, (i)]. Moreover, the objects of these
categories “Loc(−)” determined by X, Π [i.e., by the unique chain of length 0] is
terminal [cf. [Mzk2], Theorem C] — i.e., a “core” [cf. the terminology of [Mzk7],
§2; [Mzk8], §2].
Finally, we observe that the theory of the present §4 admits a “tempered version”, in the case of hyperbolic orbicurves over MLF’s. We begin by recalling basic
facts concerning tempered fundamental groups. Let k be an MLF of residue characteristic p; k an algebraic closure of k; X a hyperbolic orbicurve over k. We shall
use a subscript k to denote the result of a base-change from k to k. Write
π1tp (X);

π1tp (Xk )

60

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

for the tempered fundamental groups of X, Xk [cf. [André], §4; [Mzk10], Examples 3.10, 5.6]. Thus, the proﬁnite completion of π1tp (X) (respectively, π1tp (Xk ))
is naturally isomorphic to the usual étale fundamental group π1 (X) (respectively,
π1 (Xk )). If H ⊆ π1tp (Xk ) is an open subgroup of ﬁnite index, then recall that the
minimal co-free subgroup of H
H co-fr ⊆ H
[cf. §0] is precisely the subgroup of H with the property that the quotient H 
H/H co-fr corresponds to the tempered covering of Xk determined by the universal
covering of the dual graph of the special ﬁber of a stable model of Xk — cf. [André],
proof of Lemma 6.1.1.

maximal compact subgroups (respectively, nontrivial intersections of two
distinct maximal compact subgroups) of H [l] . In particular, the graph ΓH
may be reconstructed — “group-theoretically” — from the verticial and edgelike subgroups of H [l] , together with their various mutual inclusion relations.
(v) The prime number p may be characterized — “group-theoretically”
— as the unique prime number l such that their exist open subgroups H, J ⊆ Δtp

of ﬁnite index, together with distinct prime numbers l1 , l2 , satisfying the following
properties: (a) H is a normal subgroup of J of index l; (b) for i = 1, 2, the outer
action of J on H [li ] [cf. (iv)] ﬁxes [the conjugacy class in H [li ] of ] and induces
the trivial outer action on some maximal compact subgroup of H [li ] [cf.
(iv)].
(vi) Let l be a prime number = p [a “group-theoretic” condition, by (v)!];
H ⊆ Δtp
X an open subgroup of ﬁnite index. Then the set of cusps of the covering
of Xk corresponding to H may be characterized — “group-theoretically” — as
the set of conjugacy classes in H [l] of the commensurators in H [l] of the images in
H [l] of edge-like subgroups of J [l] [cf. (iv)], where J ⊆ H is an open subgroup of
ﬁnite index, which are not contained in edge-like subgroups of H [l] . In particular,
by allowing H to vary, this yields a [“group-theoretic”] characterization of the

decomposition groups of cusps in Δtp

Lemma 4.5, (v)].
Proof. Assertion (i) follows immediately from the discussion at the beginning of
[Mzk10], §6 [cf. also the discussion of [André], §4.5]. Assertion (ii) is the content
of [Mzk10], Lemma 6.1, (ii), (iii) [cf. also [André], Corollary 6.2.2]. Assertion (iii)
follows immediately from assertion (i). Assertion (iv) follows immediately from
[Mzk10], Theorem 3.7, (iv); [Mzk10], Corollary 3.9 [cf. also the proof of [Mzk10],
Corollary 3.11]. Assertions (v), (vi) amount to summaries of the relevant portions
of the proof of [Mzk10], Corollary 3.11. Here, in assertion (v), we observe that at
least one of the li is = p; thus, for this choice of li , the action of J ﬁxes and induces
the trivial outer action on some verticial subgroup of H [li ] .
Remark 4.10.1. It is not clear to the author at the time of writing how to prove
a version of Proposition 4.10, (vi), for decomposition groups of closed points which
are not cusps [i.e., a “tempered version” of Lemma 4.1, (iii)].
Remark 4.10.2. A certain fact applied in the portion of the proof of [Mzk10],
Corollary 3.11, summarized in Proposition 4.10, (vi), is only given a somewhat
sketchy proof in loc. cit. A more detailed treatment of this fact is given in [Mzk15],
Corollary 2.11.
Now we are ready to state the tempered version of Deﬁnition 4.2.
Deﬁnition 4.11.

is deﬁned to be a collection of isomorphisms of topological groups Πj → Ψj [for
j = 0, . . . , n] that are compatible with the rigidifying homomorphisms. [Here, we
note that the condition of compatibility with the rigidifying homomorphisms implies
[since all of the topological groups involved are residually ﬁnite with slim proﬁnite
completions] that every automorphism of a Π-chain is given by the identity, and that
every isomorphism of Π-chains of the same length is compatible with the respective
operation homomorphisms.] Thus, one obtains a category
Chain(Π)
whose objects are the Π-chains [with arbitrary associated type-chain], and whose
morphisms are the isomorphisms between Π-chains [with identical type-chains].
A terminal homomorphism between two Π-chains [with arbitrary associated typechains]

6.4] Πn → Ψm that is compatible [up to composition with an inner automorphism]
with the open homomorphisms Πn → G, Ψm → G. Thus, one obtains a category
Chaintrm (Π)
whose objects are the Π-chains [with arbitrary associated type-chain], and whose
morphisms are the terminal homomorphisms between Π-chains; write
Chainiso-trm (Π) ⊆ Chaintrm (Π)
for the subcategory determined by the terminal isomorphisms [i.e., the isomorphisms of Chaintrm (Π)]. Thus, it follows immediately from the deﬁnitions that we

Appendix: The Theory of Albanese Varieties
In the present Appendix, we review the basic theory of Albanese varieties [cf.,
e.g., [NS], [Serre1], [Chev], [BS], [SS]], as it will be applied in the present paper.
One of our aims here is to present the theory in modern scheme-theoretic language
[i.e., as opposed to [NS], [Serre1], [Chev]], but without resorting to the introduction
of motives and derived categories, as in [BS], [SS]. Put another way, although there
is no doubt that the content of the present Appendix is implicit in the literature,
the lack of an appropriate reference that discusses this material explicitly seemed
to the author to constitute suﬃcient justiﬁcation for the inclusion of a detailed
discussion of this material in the present paper.
In the following discussion, we ﬁx a perfect ﬁeld k, together with an algebraic
closure k of k. The result of base-change [of k-schemes and morphisms of k-schemes]
def

from k to k will be denoted by means of a subscript “k”. Write Gk = Gal(k/k) for
the absolute Galois group of k.
We will apply basic well-known properties of commutative group schemes of
ﬁnite type over k without further explanation. In particular, we recall the following:
(I) The category of such group schemes is abelian [cf., e.g., [SGA3-1], VIA ,
5.4]; subgroup schemes are always closed [cf., e.g., [SGA3-1], VIB , 1.4.2];
reduced group schemes over k are k-smooth [cf., e.g., [SGA3-1], VIA , 1.3.1].
(II) Every connected reduced subquotient of a semi-abelian variety over k
[i.e., an extension of an abelian variety by a torus] is itself a semi-abelian
variety over k. [Indeed, this may be veriﬁed easily by applying a wellknown theorem of Chevalley [cf., e.g., [Con], for a treatment of this result
in modern language; [Bor], Theorems 10.6, 10.9], to the eﬀect that any
smooth connected commutative group scheme over k may be written as
an extension of a semi-abelian variety by a successive extension of copies
of the additive group (Ga )k .]
(III) Let φ : B → A be a connected ﬁnite étale Galois covering of a semiabelian variety A over k, with identity element 0A ∈ A(k), such that
(φ−1 (0A ))(k) = ∅, and the degree of φ is prime to the characteristic of
k. Then each element of b ∈ (φ−1 (0A ))(k) determines on B a unique
structure of semi-abelian variety over k on B such that b is the identity
element of the group B(k), and φ is a homomorphism of group schemes
over k. [Indeed this may be veriﬁed easily by applying the theorem of
Chevalley quoted in (II) above.] Note, moreover, that in this situation,
if k = k, then we obtain an inclusion Gal(B/A) → B(k), which implies,
in particular, that the covering φ is abelian, and, moreover, appears as
a subcovering of a covering A → A given by multiplication by some n
invertible in k.
Deﬁnition A.1.
(i) A variety over k, or k-variety, is deﬁned to be a geometrically integral
separated scheme of ﬁnite type over k. A k-variety will be called complete if it is

TOPICS IN ABSOLUTE ANABELIAN GEOMETRY I

67

proper over k. We shall refer to a pair (V, v), where V is a k-variety and v ∈ V (k),
as a pointed variety over k; a morphism of pointed varieties over k, or pointed kmorphism, (V, v) → (W, w) [which we shall often simply write V → W , when v, w
are ﬁxed] is a morphism of k-varieties that maps v → w. Any reduced group scheme
G over k has a natural structure of pointed variety over k determined by the identity
element 0G ∈ G(k). If G, H are group schemes over k, then we shall refer to a
k-morphism G → H as a [k-]trans-homomorphism if it factors as the composite of a
homomorphism of group schemes G → H over k with an automorphism of H given
by translation by an element of H(k). If V is a k-variety, then we shall use the
notation π1 (V ) to denote the étale fundamental group [relative to an appropriate
choice of basepoint] of V . Thus, we have a natural exact sequence of fundamental
groups 1 → π1 (Vk ) → π1 (V ) → Gk → 1. Let Σk ⊆ Primes [cf. §0] be the set of
primes invertible in k; use the superscript “(Σk )” to denote the maximal pro-Σk
quotient of a proﬁnite group; if V is a k-variety, then we shall write
def

ΔV = π1 (Vk )(Σk ) ;

def

ΠV = π1 (V )/Ker(π1 (Vk )  π1 (Vk )(Σk ) )

for the resulting geometrically pro-Σk fundamental groups, so we have a natural
exact sequence of fundamental groups 1 → ΔV → ΠV → Gk → 1.
(ii) Let C be a class of commutative group schemes of ﬁnite type over k. If A
is a group scheme over k that belongs to the class C, then we shall write A ∈ C. If
(V, v) is a pointed k-variety, then we shall refer to a morphism of pointed k-varieties
φ:V →A
as a C-Albanese morphism if A ∈ C [so A is equipped with a point 0A ∈ A(k), as
discussed in (i)], and, moreover, for any pointed k-morphism φ : V → A , where
A ∈ C, there exists a unique homomorphism ψ : A → A of group schemes over k
such that φ = ψ ◦ φ. In this situation, A will also be referred to as the C-Albanese
variety of V . We shall write Ckab for the class of abelian varieties over k and Cks-ab for
the class of semi-abelian varieties over k. When C = Cks-ab , the term “C-Albanese”,
will often be abbreviated “Albanese”.
(iii) If X is a k-variety (respectively, noetherian scheme) which admits a log
structure such that the resulting log scheme X log is log smooth over k [where we
regard Spec(k) as equipped with the trivial log structure] (respectively, log regular
[cf. [Kato]]), then we shall refer to X as k-toric (respectively, absolutely toric)
and to X log as a toriﬁer, or torifying log scheme, for X. [Thus, “k-toric” implies
“absolutely toric”.]
(iv) If k is of positive characteristic, then, for any k-scheme X and integer
n
n ≥ 1, we shall write X F for the result of base-changing X by the n-th iterate
of the Frobenius morphism on k; thus, we obtain a k-linear relative Frobenius
n
n def
morphism ΦnX : X → X F . If k is of characteristic zero, then we set X F = X,
def

ΦnX = idX , for integers n ≥ 1. If φ : X → Y is a morphism of k-schemes, then
we shall refer to φ as a sub-Frobenius morphism if, for some integer n ≥ 1, there
n
n
exists a k-morphism ψ : Y → X F such that ψ ◦ φ = ΦnX , φF ◦ ψ = ΦnY . [Thus, in
characteristic zero, a sub-Frobenius morphism is simply an automorphism.]

68

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

Remark A.1.1.
As is well-known, if V is a k-variety, then ΦnV induces an
∼
isomorphism ΠV → ΠV F n , for all integers n ≥ 1. Note that this implies that every
∼
sub-Frobenius morphism V → W of k-varieties induces isomorphisms ΠV → ΠW ,
∼
ΔV → Δ W .
Before proceeding, we review the following well-known result.
Lemma A.2.
(Morphisms to Abelian and Semi-abelian Schemes) Let
S be a noetherian scheme; X an S-scheme whose underlying scheme is absolutely
toric; A an abelian scheme over S (respectively, a semi-abelian scheme over
S which is an extension of an abelian scheme B → S by a torus T → S); V ⊆ X
an open subscheme whose complement in X is of codimension ≥ 1 (respectively,
≥ 2) in X. Then any morphism of S-schemes V → A extends uniquely to X.
Proof. First, we consider the case where A is an abelian scheme. If X is regular,
then Lemma A.2 follows from [BLR], §8.4, Corollary 6. When X is an arbitrary
absolutely toric scheme with toriﬁer X log , we reduce immediately to the case where
X is strictly henselian, hence admits a resolution of singularities [cf., e.g., [Mzk4],
§2]
Y log → X log
∼

— i.e., a log étale morphism of log schemes which induces an isomorphism UY → UX
between the respective interiors such that Y log arises from a divisor with normal
crossings in a regular scheme Y . Since the “regular case” has already been settled,
we may assume that UX ⊆ V ; also, it follows that the restriction UY → A to
UY of the resulting morphism UX → A extends uniquely to a morphism Y → A.
def
The graph of this morphism determines a closed subscheme Z ⊆ AY = A ×S Y .
def
Moreover, by considering the image of Z under the morphism AY → AX = A ×S
X of proper X-schemes, we conclude from “Zariski’s main theorem” [since X is
normal] that to obtain the [manifestly unique, since V is schematically dense in
X] desired extension X → A, it suﬃces to show that the ﬁbers of Y → X map
to points of A. On the other hand, as is observed in the discussion of [Mzk4], §2,
each irreducible component of the ﬁber of Y → X at a point x ∈ X is a rational
variety over the residue ﬁeld k(x) at x, hence maps to a point in the abelian variety
def

Ax = A ×S k(x) [cf., e.g., [BLR], §10.3, Theorem 1, (b), (c)]. This completes the
proof of Lemma A.2 in the non-resp’d case. Thus, to complete the proof of Lemma
A.2 in the resp’d case, we may assume that A = T is a torus over S. In fact, by étale
descent, we may even assume that T is a split torus over S. Then it suﬃces to show
that if L is any line bundle on X that admits a generating section sV ∈ Γ(V, L),
then it follows that sV extends to a generating section of L over X. But since X is
normal, this follows immediately from [SGA2], XI, 3.4; [SGA2], XI, 3.11.
Proposition A.3.
(Basic Properties of Albanese Varieties) Let C ∈

s-ab
{Ck , Ck }; φV : V → A, φW : W → B C-Albanese morphisms. Then:
(i) (Base-change) Let k  be an algebraic ﬁeld extension of k; denote the

means of a subscript “k  ”. If C = Ckab (respectively, C = Cks-ab ), then set C  = Ckab
(respectively, C  = Cks-ab
). Then (φV )k : Vk → Ak is a C  -Albanese morphism.

(ii) (Functoriality) Given any k-morphism βV : V → W , there exists a
unique k-trans-homomorphism βA : A → B such that φW ◦ βV = βA ◦ φV . If,
moreover, βV is pointed, then βA is a homomorphism.

(iv) (Sub-Frobenius Morphisms) If, in (ii), βV is a sub-Frobenius morphism, then so is βA .
(v) (Toric Open Immersions) Suppose, in (ii), that βV is an open immersion, that W is k-toric, and that if C = Ckab (respectively, C = Cks-ab ), then
the codimension of the complement of the image of βV in W is ≥ 1 (respectively,
≥ 2). Then βA is an isomorphism.
(vi) (Dominant Quotients) If, in (ii), βV is dominant, then βA is surjective.
(vii) (Surjectivity of Fundamental Groups) The [outer] homomorphisms
ΠφV : ΠV → ΠA , ΔφV : ΔV → ΔA induced by φV are surjective.
(viii) (Semi-abelian versus Abelian Albanese Morphisms) Suppose that
C = Cks-ab . Write A  Aab for the maximal quotient of group schemes over k such
that Aab ∈ Ckab . Then the composite morphism V → A  Aab is a Ckab -Albanese
morphism.
(ix) (Group Law Generation) For integers n ≥ 1, write
ζn : V ×k . . . ×k V → A
(v1 , . . . , vn ) →

vj

for the morphism from the product over k of n copies of V to A given by adding
the images under φV of the points in the n factors. Then there exists an integer N
such that ζn is surjective for all n ≥ N . In particular, if V is proper, then so is
A.
Proof. To verify assertion (i), we may assume that k  is a ﬁnite [hence necessarily
étale, since k is perfect] extension of k. Then assertion (i) follows immediately
by considering the Weil restriction functor Wk /k (−) from k  to k. That is to
say, it is immediate that Wk /k (−) takes objects in C  to objects in C. Thus, to
give a k  -morphism Vk → A (respectively, Ak → A ) is equivalent to giving a
k-morphism V → Wk /k (A ) (respectively, A → Wk /k (A )). This completes the
proof of assertion (i). Assertions (ii), (iii) follow immediately from the deﬁnition of
a “C-Albanese morphism”; assertion (iv) follows immediately from assertion (iii).
Assertion (v) follows immediately from the deﬁnition of a “C-Albanese morphism”,
in light of Lemma A.2.

70

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

Assertion (vi) follows from the deﬁnition of a “C-Albanese morphism”, by arguing as follows: First, we observe that βV is an epimorphism in the category of
schemes. Also, we may assume without loss of generality that βV is pointed. Now
consider the composite β ◦ φW : W → B/C of φW : W → B with the natural quodef

tient morphism β : B  B/C, where we write C = Im(βA ) ⊆ B [so C ∈ C]. Since
β ◦ φW has the same restriction [via βV ] to V as the constant pointed morphism
W → B/C, we thus conclude that β ◦ φW is constant, i.e., that Im(φW ) ⊆ C.
But, by the deﬁnition of a “C-Albanese morphism”, this implies the existence of
a section B → C of the natural inclusion C → B [i.e., such that the composite
B → C → B is equal to the identity], hence that B = C, as desired. In a similar
vein, assertion (vii) follows from the deﬁnition of a “C-Albanese morphism”, by observing that if ΠφV : ΠV → ΠA fails to surject, then [after possibly replacing k by a
ﬁnite extension of k, which is possible, by assertion (i)] it follows that φV : V → A
factors V → C → A, where the morphism C → A is a nontrivial ﬁnite étale Galois
covering, with C geometrically connected over k, so C ∈ C. But this implies, by
the deﬁnition of a “C-Albanese morphism”, the existence of a section A → C of the
surjection C  A [i.e., such that the composite A → C  A is the identity], hence
∼
that this surjection is an isomorphism C → A, a contradiction.
Next, we observe that assertion (viii) follows immediately from the deﬁnitions,
in light of the well-known fact that any homomorphism G → H of group schemes
over k, where G is a torus and H is an abelian variety, is trivial [cf., e.g., [BLR],
§10.3, Theorem 1, (b), (c)].
Finally, we consider assertion (ix). First, let us observe that we may assume
without loss of generality that k = k. Next, let us observe that since the image
of φV contains 0A ∈ A(k), it follows that for n ≥ m, the image In ⊆ A(k) of ζn
contains the image Im of ζm . Write Fn ⊆ A for the [reduced closed subscheme given
by the] closure of In . Since the domain of ζn is irreducible, it follows immediately
that Fn is irreducible. Thus, the ascending sequence . . . ⊆ Fm ⊆ . . . ⊆ Fn ⊆ . . .
def
terminates, i.e., we have Fn = Fm for all n, m ≥ N  , for some N  ; write F = FN  .
Since IN  is constructible, it follows that IN  contains a nonempty open subset U
of [the underlying topological space of] F ; let u ∈ U (k). Now let us write In for
the union of the translates of U by elements of In ; thus, one veriﬁes immediately
that In is open in F , that In ⊆ In+N  , and that u + In ⊆ In . Since F is noetherian,

it thus follows that the ascending sequence . . . ⊆ Im
⊆ . . . ⊆ In ⊆ . . . terminates,




i.e., that for some N > N , we have In = Im for all n, m ≥ N  ; write I ⊆ F
for the resulting open subscheme. Thus, for n ≥ N  , u + I ⊆ u + In+N  ⊆ I. On
the other hand, again since F is noetherian, it follows that the ascending sequence
I ⊆ I − u ⊆ I − 2u ⊆ . . . terminates, hence that u + I = I. In particular, for some
N  > N  , we have In = I, for n ≥ N  . Next, let us observe that for any j ∈ I(k),
it follows from the deﬁnition of the In that j + I ⊆ I, hence [as in the case where
j = u], we have j + I = I. Since 0A ∈ I, it thus follows that I is closed under
the group operation on A, as well as taking inverses in A. Thus, it follows that
I is a subgroup scheme of A, hence that I is a closed subscheme of A [so I = F ].
But this implies, by the deﬁnition of a “C-Albanese morphism”, the existence of a
homomorphism A → I whose composite with the inclusion I → A is the identity
on A. Thus, we conclude that the inclusion I → A is a surjection, i.e., that I = A,
as desired.

A proof of the following result may be found, in essence, in [NS] [albeit in
somewhat archaic language], as well as in [FGA], 236, Théorème 2.1, (ii) [albeit
in somewhat sketchy form]. Various other approaches [e.g., via Weil divisors] to
this result are discussed in [Klei], Theorem 5.4, and the discussion following [Klei],
Theorem 5.4.
Theorem A.4.
(Properness of the Identity Component of the Picard
Scheme) The identity component of the Picard scheme
Pic0V /k
[cf., e.g., [BLR], §8.2, Theorem 3; [BLR], §8.4] associated to a complete normal
variety V over a ﬁeld k is proper.
Proof. Write G for the reduced group scheme (Pic0V /k )red over k. Then by a
well-known theorem of Chevalley [cf., e.g., [Con], for a treatment of this result
in modern language; [Bor], Theorems 10.6, 10.9], it follows that to show that G
[hence also Pic0V /k ] is proper, it suﬃces to show that G does not contain any copies
of the multiplicative group (Gm )k or the additive group (Ga )k . On the other hand,
since (Gm )k , (Ga )k may be thought of as open subschemes of the aﬃne line A1k ,
this follows immediately from Lemma A.5 below [i.e., by applying the functorial
interpretation of Pic0V /k — cf., e.g., [BLR], §8.1, Proposition 4].
Lemma A.5.
(Rational Families of Line Bundles) Let V be a normal
variety over k; U ⊆ A1k a nonempty open subscheme of the aﬃne line A1k . Then
every line bundle LU on V ×k U arises via pull-back from a line bundle Lk on V .
Proof. In the following, let us regard A1k as an open subscheme A1k ⊆ P1k of the
projective line [obtained in the standard way by removing the point at inﬁnity
∞k ∈ P1k (k)]. First, let us verify Lemma A.5 under the further hypothesis that
V is smooth over k. Then it follows immediately that V ×k P1k is smooth over k,
hence locally factorial [cf., e.g., [SGA2], XI, 3.13, (i)]. Thus, LU extends to a line
def

bundle LP on P = V ×k P1k (⊇ V ×k A1k ⊇ V ×k U ). Moreover, by tensoring
with line bundles associated to multiples of the divisor on P arising from ∞k , we
may assume that the degree of LP on the ﬁbers of the trivial projective bundle
f : P → V is zero. Thus, the natural morphism f ∗ f∗ LP → LP is an isomorphism,
which exhibits LP , hence also LU , as a line bundle Lk pulled back from V .
Now we return to the case of an arbitrary normal variety V . As is well-known,
V contains a dense open subscheme W ⊆ V which is smooth over k and such that
def
the closed subscheme F = V \ W [where we equip F with the reduced induced
structure] is of codimension ≥ 2 in V [cf., e.g., [SGA2], XI, 3.11, applied to the
geometric ﬁber of V → Spec(k)]. Thus, by the argument given in the smooth case,
def

we conclude that MU = LU |W ×k U arises from a line bundle Mk on W . Next, let
us write ιk : W → V , ιU : W ×k U → V ×k U for the natural open immersions.
Since U is k-ﬂat, it follows immediately that we have a natural isomorphism
∼

((ιk )∗ Mk )|V ×k U → (ιU )∗ MU

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

[arising, for instance, by computing the right-hand side by means of an aﬃne covering of W ×k U obtained by taking the product over k with U of an aﬃne covering of W ]. On the other hand, since V ×k U is normal and F ×k U ⊆ V ×k U
is a closed subscheme of codimension ≥ 2, it follows from the deﬁnition of MU
∼
that (ιU )∗ MU → LU [cf., e.g., [SGA2], XI, 3.4; [SGA2], XI, 3.11], i.e., that
((ιk )∗ Mk )|V ×k U is a line bundle on V ×k U . On the other hand, since the morphism
U → Spec(k), hence also the projection morphism V ×k U → V , is faithfully ﬂat,
def

we thus conclude that Lk = (ιk )∗ Mk is a line bundle on V whose pull-back to
V ×k U is isomorphic to LU , as desired.

the associated Picard scheme; A the dual abelian variety to G = (Pic0V /k )red
[which is an abelian variety by Theorem A.4]; v ∈ V (k). Then the universal
line bundle PV [cf., e.g., [BLR], §8.1, Proposition 4] on V ×k G relative to the
rigidiﬁcation determined by v [i.e., such that PV |{v}×G is trivial] determines [by
the deﬁnition of A] a morphism of pointed k-varieties
φ:V →A
such that the pull-back of the Poincaré bundle PA on A ×k G via φ ×k G : V ×k
G → A ×k G is isomorphic to PV [in a fashion compatible with the respective
rigidiﬁcations]. Moreover:
(i) The morphism φ is a Ckab -Albanese morphism.
(ii) Suppose, in the situation of Proposition A.3, (ii), that W is also complete
and normal, and that βV is pointed and birational. Then the dual morphism
βG : H → G to βA : A → B is a closed immersion. In particular, βA is an
isomorphism if and only if dimk (A) ≤ dimk (B).
(iii) The morphism φ induces an injection H 1 (A, OA ) → H 1 (V, OV ).

→ ΔA [where we refer
(iv) The morphism φ induces an isomorphism Δab-t
V
to §0 for the notation “ab-t”].
Proof. First, we consider assertion (i). Let ψV : V → C be a morphism of pointed
k-varieties, where C ∈ Ckab . Now by the functoriality of “Pic0(−)/k ”, ψV induces a
def

morphism D = Pic0C/k → Pic0V /k [so D is the dual abelian variety to C], hence a
morphism ψD : D → G, whose dual gives a morphism ψA : A → C. The fact that
ψV = ψA ◦φ : V → C follows by thinking of morphisms as classifying morphisms for
line bundles and considering the following [a priori, not necessarily commutative]
diagram of morphisms between varieties equipped with [isomorphism classes of] line

— which implies that ψV = ψA ◦ φ. Finally, the uniqueness of such a “ψA ” follows
immediately by applying “Pic0(−)/k ” to the condition “ψV = ψA ◦ φ : V → A → C”.
This completes the proof of assertion (i).
Next, we consider assertion (ii). First, observe that there exists a k-smooth
open subscheme U ⊆ W such that W \ U has codimension ≥ 2 in W [cf., e.g.,
[SGA2], XI, 3.11, as it was applied in the proof of Lemma A.5], and, moreover,
βV : V → W admits a section σ : U → V over U . Note, moreover, that if S is any
def
def
local artinian ﬁnite k-scheme, and we write ιS : US = U ×k S → WS = W ×S k
for the natural inclusion, then for any line bundle L on WS , we have a natural
∼
isomorphism (ιS )∗ (ι∗S L) → L [cf., e.g., [SGA2], XI, 3.4; [SGA2], XI, 3.11]. Thus, by
applying this natural isomorphism, together with the section σ, we conclude that
the map Pic0W/k (S) → Pic0V /k (S) [induced by βV ] is an injection, which implies
that the kernel group scheme of βG : H → G is trivial, hence that βG is a closed
immersion, as desired. This completes the proof of assertion (ii).
Next, we consider assertion (iii). The morphism H 1 (A, OA ) → H 1 (V, OV ) in
question may be interpreted as the morphism induced by φ on tangent spaces to the
Picard scheme, i.e., as the morphism
G(k[]/(2 )) = Pic0A/k (k[]/(2 )) → Pic0V /k (k[]/(2 ))
[cf., e.g., [BLR], §8.4, Theorem 1, (a)]. But, by the deﬁnition of G, this morphism
arises from the natural closed immersion G → Pic0V /k , hence is an injection, as
desired.
Finally, we consider assertion (iv). The surjectivity portion of assertion (iv)
follows immediately from Proposition A.3, (vii). To verify the fact that the surjection Δab-t
 ΔA is an isomorphism, we reason as follows: First, we recall that
V
if n ≥ 1 is an integer invertible in k, then a line bundle L on V such that L⊗n
is trivial may be interpreted [via the Kummer exact sequence in étale cohomology] as a continuous homomorphism ΔV → (Z/nZ)(1) [where the “(1)” denotes
a “Tate twist”]. On the other hand, by [BLR], §8.4, Theorem 7, there exists an
integer m ≥ 1 such that for every integer n ≥ 1, the cokernel of the inclusion
n G(k) → n PicV /k (k) [where the “n ” preceding an abelian group denotes the kernel
of multiplication by n] is annihilated by m. In light of the functorial interpretation
of the inclusion G → Pic0V /k ⊆ PicV /k , this implies that the cokernel of the homomorphism Hom(ΔA , Q/Z) → Hom(ΔV , Q/Z) is annihilated by m. But, by applying
Hom(−, Q/Z), this implies that the induced homomorphism Δab
V → ΔA has ﬁnite
kernel, hence [in light of the surjectivity already veriﬁed] induces an isomorphism
upon passing to “ab-t”.

Remark A.6.1. The content of Proposition A.6, (i), is discussed in [FGA], 236,
Théorème 3.3, (iii).
Remark A.6.2. Suppose that we are in the situation of Proposition A.6, (ii).
Then it is not necessarily the case that the induced morphism βA is an isomorphism.
This phenomenon already appears in the work of Chevalley — cf. [Chev]; the
discussion of [Klei], p. 248; Example A.7 below.
Example A.7.
Albanese Varieties and Resolution of Singularities. For
simplicity, suppose that k = k. Write P2k = Proj(k[x1 , x2 , x3 ]) [i.e., where we
consider k[x1 , x2 , x3 ] as a graded ring, in which x1 , x2 , x3 are of degree 1]. Let
f ∈ k[x1 , x2 , x3 ] be a homogeneous polynomial that deﬁnes a smooth plane curve
X ⊆ P2k of genus ≥ 1. Thus, any x ∈ X(k) determines an embedding X → J, where
def

J is the Jacobian variety of X. Set Y = Spec(k[x1 , x2 , x3 ]/(f )); write y ∈ Y (k)
def

for the origin, UY = Y \ {y}. Thus, we have a natural morphism Y ⊇ UY → X;
UY → X is a Gm -torsor over X. In particular, UY is k-smooth. Thus, since Y
is clearly a local complete intersection [hence, in particular, Cohen-Macaulay], it
follows from Serre’s criterion of normality [cf., e.g., [SGA2], XI, 3.11] that Y is
normal. Let Z → Y be the blow-up of Y at the origin y. Thus, we obtain an
def
∼
isomorphism UZ = Z ×Y UY → UY . Moreover, one veriﬁes immediately that the
∼
morphism UZ → UY → X extends to a morphism Z → X which has the structure
def
∼
of an A1 -bundle, in which E = Z ×Y {y} ⊆ Z forms a “zero section” [so E → X].
Thus, Z admits a natural compactiﬁcation Z → Z ∗ to a P1 -bundle Z ∗ → X.
∼
Moreover, by gluing Z ∗ \ E to Y along Z \ E = UZ → UY ⊆ Y , we obtain a
compactiﬁcation Y → Y ∗ such that the blow-up morphism extends to a morphism
Z ∗ → Y ∗ [which may be thought of as the blow-up of Y ∗ at y ∈ Y (k) ⊆ Y ∗ (k)].
On the other hand, note that the composite Z ∗ → X → J determines a closed
∼
∼
immersion Z ∗ ⊇ E → X → J. Thus, the restriction UY → UZ → J of this
∼
morphism Z ∗ → J to UY → UZ does not extend to Y or Y ∗ . In particular, it follows
that if we write Y ∗ → AY , Z ∗ → AZ for the Ckab -Albanese varieties of Proposition
A.6, (i), then the surjection AZ  AY induced by Z ∗ → Y ∗ [cf. Proposition A.6,
(ii)] is not an isomorphism.
Proposition A.8. (Albanese Varieties of Complements of Divisors with
Normal Crossings) Let Z be a smooth projective variety over k; D ⊆ Z a
def

divisor with normal crossings; Y = Z \ D ⊆ Z; y ∈ Y (k);
D=

[for some integer r ≥ 1] the decomposition of D into irreducible components; M
the free Z-module [of rank r] of divisors supported on D; P ⊆ M the submodule

(i) (Y, y) admits an Albanese morphism Y → AY .

(ii) Suppose that each of the Dn is geometrically irreducible. Then the AY
of (i) may be taken to be an extension of the abelian variety AZ given by the
def

dual to GZ = (Pic0Z/k )red [cf. Propositions A.3, (viii); A.6, (i)] by a torus whose
character group is naturally isomorphic to P .
∼

(iii) The morphism Y → AY of (i) induces an isomorphism Δab-t
→ ΔAY .
Y
Proof. By étale descent [with respect to ﬁnite extensions of k], it follows immediately that to verify assertion (i), it suﬃces to verify assertion (ii). Next, we consider
assertion (ii). Again, by étale descent, we may assume without loss of generality
that k = k. Note that the tautological homomorphism P → GZ (k) determines an
extension
0 → TY → AY → AZ → 0
of AZ by a split torus TY with character group P . Now the fact that AY serves
as an Albanese variety for Y is essentially a tautology: Indeed, since any pointed
morphism from Y to an abelian variety C extends [cf. Lemma A.2] to a pointed
morphism Z → C, and, moreover, we already know that AZ is a Ckab -Albanese
variety for Z [cf. Proposition A.6, (i)], it follows that it suﬃces to consider pointed
morphisms Y → B, where B is an extension of AZ by a [split] torus, and the
composite morphism Y → B  AZ coincides with the morphism that exhibits
AZ as a Ckab -Albanese variety for Y . In fact, for simplicity, we may even assume
that this torus is simply (Gm )k . Thus, it suﬃces to consider pointed morphisms
Y → B, where B is an extension of AZ by (Gm )k , determined by some extension
class κB ∈ GZ (k), and the composite morphism Y → B  AZ coincides with
the morphism that exhibits AZ as a Ckab -Albanese variety for Y . Then the datum
of such a morphism Y → B corresponds precisely to an invertible section of the
restriction to Y of the line bundle L on Z given by pulling back the Gm -torsor
B → AZ via the Albanese morphism Z → AZ . Note that such an invertible section
∼
of L|Y may be thought of as the datum of an isomorphism OZ (E) → L for some
divisor E supported on D. That is to say, since the isomorphism class of L is
precisely the class determined by the element κB ∈ GZ (k) ⊆ PicZ/k (k), it thus
follows that E ∈ P , and that κB is the image of E ∈ P in Pic0Z/k (k) = GZ (k).
Thus, in summary, the datum of a pointed morphism Y → B, where B is an
extension of AZ by a [split] torus, and the composite morphism Y → B  AZ
coincides with the morphism that exhibits AZ as a Ckab -Albanese variety for Y , is
equivalent [in a functorial way] to the datum of a homomorphism AY → B lying
over the identity morphism of AZ . In particular, the identity morphism AY → AY
determines a morphism Y → AY . This completes the proof of assertion (ii).
Finally, we consider assertion (iii). We may assume without loss of generality
that k = k [cf. Proposition A.3, (i)]. Let F ⊆ D be a closed subscheme of
def

codimension ≥ 1 in D such that Z  = Z \ F ⊆ Z, D = D \ F ⊆ D are k-smooth.

that we have an isomorphism

that the surjection Δab-t

Remark A.8.1. A sharper version [in the sense that it includes a computation of
the torsion subgroup of Δab
Y ] of Proposition A.8, (iii), is given in [SS], Proposition
4.2. The discussion of [SS] involves the point of view of 1-motives. On the other
hand, such a sharper version may also be obtained directly from the Gysin sequence
argument of the above proof of Proposition A.8, (iii), by working with torsion
coeﬃcients.
The following result is elementary and well-known.
Lemma A.9.
(Descending Chains of Subgroup Schemes) Let G be a
[not necessarily reduced] commutative group scheme of ﬁnite type over k;
. . . ⊆ Gn ⊆ . . . ⊆ G1 ⊆ G0 = G
a descending chain of [not necessarily reduced!] subgroup schemes of G, indexed
by the nonnegative integers. Then there exists an integer N such that Gn = Gm
for all n, m ≥ N .
Proof. First, let us consider the case where all of the Gn , for n ≥ 0, are reduced and
connected. Then since all of the Gn are closed integral subschemes of G, it follows
immediately that if we take any integer N such that dimk (Gn ) = dimk (Gm ) for
all n, m ≥ N , then Gn = Gm for all n, m ≥ N . Now we return to the general
case. By what we have done so far, we may assume without loss of generality that
(G0 )red = (Gn )red for all n ≥ 0. Thus, by forming the quotient by (G0 )red , we
may assume that all of the Gn are ﬁnite over Spec(k). Then Lemma A.9 follows
immediately.

Before proceeding, we recall the following result of de Jong.
Lemma A.10.
(Equivariant Alterations) Suppose that k = k; let V be
a variety over k. Then there exists a smooth projective variety Z over k, a
ﬁnite group Γ of automorphisms of Z over k, a divisor with normal crossings
D ⊆ Z stabilized by Γ, and a Γ-equivariant [relative to the trivial action of Γ on V ]
surjective, proper, generically quasi-ﬁnite morphism
def

Y = Z \D →V
such that if we write k(Z), k(V ) for the respective function ﬁelds of Z, V , then the
subﬁeld of Γ-invariants k(Z)Γ ⊆ k(Z) forms a purely inseparable extension of
k(V ).
Proof. This is the content of [deJong], Theorem 7.3.
We are now ready to prove the main result of the present Appendix, the ﬁrst
portion of which [i.e., Corollary A.11, (i)] is due to Serre [cf. [Serre1]].
Corollary A.11.

(Albanese Varieties of Arbitrary Varieties)

(i) Every pointed variety (V, v) over k admits an Albanese morphism
V → A.
(ii) Let φ : V → A be an Albanese morphism, where (V, v) is a k-toric
∼
pointed variety. Then φ induces an isomorphism Δab-t
→ ΔA .
V
Proof. First, we consider assertion (i). By applying étale descent, we may assume
without loss of generality that k = k. Let Z ⊇ Y → V be as in Lemma A.10,
y ∈ Y (k) a point that maps to v ∈ V (k) [where we observe that, as is easily veriﬁed,
the existence of an Albanese morphism as desired is independent of the choice of
v]. Then by Proposition A.8, (i), it follows that Y admits an Albanese morphism
Y → B. Thus, every pointed morphism ν : V → C, where C ∈ Cks-ab , determines,
by restriction to Y , a homomorphism B → C, whose kernel is a subgroup scheme
Hν ⊆ B. In particular, the collection of such pointed morphisms ν : V → C
determines a projective system of subgroup schemes Hν ⊆ B which is ﬁltered [a
fact that is easily veriﬁed by considering product morphisms V → C1 ×k C2 of
pointed morphisms ν1 : V → C1 , ν2 : V → C2 ]. Moreover, by Lemma A.9, this
projective system admits a coﬁnal subsystem which is constant, i.e., given by a
single subgroup scheme H ⊆ B. Now it is a tautology that the composite morphism
Y → B  B/H factors uniquely [where we observe that uniqueness follows from
the fact that Y → V is dominant] through a morphism V → B/H which serves as
an Albanese morphism for V .
Next, we consider assertion (ii). First, let us observe that, by Proposition A.3,
(i), we may assume without loss of generality that k = k. Next, let Z ⊇ Y → V ,
Γ be as in Lemma A.10; write Y → V  → V for the factorization through the
normalization V  → V of V in the purely inseparable extension k(Z)Γ of k(V ). Let

78

SHINICHI MOCHIZUKI

φ : V  → A be an Albanese morphism [which exists by assertion (i)]. Since V is
normal, it follows immediately that V  → V is a sub-Frobenius morphism. Thus,
by Proposition A.3, (iv) [cf. also Remark A.1.1], it follows that V  → V induces
∼
∼
ab-t
isomorphisms Δab-t
V  → ΔV , ΔA → ΔA . In particular, to complete the proof of
∼
assertion (ii), it suﬃces to verify that φ induces an isomorphism Δab-t
V  → ΔA .
Next, let Y → B be an Albanese morphism for Y [cf. Proposition A.8, (i)].
Then, by Proposition A.3, (ii), the action of Γ on Y extends to a compatible action
of Γ on B by k-trans-homomorphisms. This action of Γ on B may be thought of
as the combination of an action of Γ on the group scheme B [i.e., via group scheme
automorphisms], together with a twisted homomorphism χ : Γ → B(k) [where Γ
acts on B(k) via the group scheme action of Γ on B]. Write B  C  for the quotient
semi-abelian scheme of B by the group scheme action Γ, i.e., the quotient of B by
the subgroup scheme generated by the images of the group scheme endomorphisms
(1 − γ) : B → B, for γ ∈ Γ. Thus, χ determines a homomorphism χ : Γ → C  (k);
write C  → C for the quotient semi-abelian scheme of C  by the ﬁnite subgroup
scheme of C  determined by the image of χ . Note that every trans-homomorphism
of semi-abelian schemes B → D which is Γ-equivariant with respect to the trivial
action of Γ on D and the trans-homomorphism action of Γ of B factors uniquely
through B  C.
Now I claim that the composite Y → B  C factors uniquely through V  .
Indeed, this is clear generically; write ξ  : ηV  → C for the resulting morphism.
Here, we use the notation “η(−) ” to denote the spectrum of the function ﬁeld of
“(−)”. Since the morphism V  → V is a sub-Frobenius morphism, it thus follows
n
that for some integer n ≥ 1, the composite ηV  → C → C F of ξ  with ΦnC factors
n
through the natural morphism ηV  → ηV , thus yielding a morphism ξ : ηV → C F .
Now since V is normal, it follows from the properness of Y → V that ξ extends
uniquely to points of height 1 of V ; thus, since V is k-toric, it follows from Lemma
A.2 that ξ extends uniquely to the entire scheme V . Finally, by the deﬁnition of
V  → V as a normalization morphism, it follows that from the fact that ΦnC is ﬁnite
and surjective that ξ  extends uniquely to the entire scheme V  . This completes the
proof of the claim.
Next, let us observe that it is a tautology that the morphism V  → C resulting
from the above claim is an Albanese morphism for V  . In particular, we may
assume without loss of generality that φ : V  → A is V  → C. Next, let us
observe that it follows immediately from the description of ﬁnite étale coverings
of semi-abelian schemes reviewed at the beginning of the present Appendix that
the functor “(−) → Δ(−) ” transforms exact sequences of semi-abelian schemes
into exact sequences of proﬁnite groups. Thus, if follows immediately from the
construction of C (= A ) from B that, for l ∈ Σk , the surjection ΔB ⊗Ql  ΔA ⊗Ql
induces an isomorphism
∼

(ΔB ⊗ Ql )/Γ → ΔA ⊗ Ql
[where the “/Γ” denotes the maximal quotient on which Γ acts trivially].
On the other hand, by Proposition A.8, (iii), it follows that we have a natural

for l ∈ Σk . Moreover, since the morphism Y → V  is dominant, it induces an open
homomorphism ΔY → ΔV  , hence a surjection Δab-t
⊗ Ql  Δab-t
Y
V  ⊗ Ql which is
Γ-equivariant [with respect to the trivial action of Γ on Δab-t

composite of surjections
(Δab-t

Y
V  ⊗ Ql  ΔA ⊗ Ql
[cf. Proposition A.3, (vii)]. Thus, we conclude that these surjections are isomor
phisms, hence that the surjection Δab-t
V   ΔA induced by φ [cf. Proposition A.3,
(vii)], is an isomorphism, as desired.
Remark A.11.1.
In fact, given any variety V over k, one may construct an
“Albanese morphism” V → A, where A is a torsor over a semi-abelian variety over
k, by passing to a ﬁnite [separable] extension k  of k such that V (k  ) = ∅, applying
Corollary A.11, (i), over k  , and then descending back to k. This morphism V → A
will then satisfy the universal property for morphisms V → A to torsors A over
semi-abelian varieties over k [i.e., every such morphism V → A admits a unique
factorization V → A → A , where the morphism A → A is a k-morphism that basechanges to a trans-homomorphism over k]. In the present Appendix, however, we
always assumed the existence of rational points in order to simplify the discussion.
Remark A.11.2. One may further generalize Remark A.11.1, as follows. If V is
a generically scheme-like [cf. §0] geometrically integral separated algebraic stack of
ﬁnite type over k that is obtained by forming the quotient, in the sense of stacks,
of some variety W over k by the action of a ﬁnite group of automorphisms Γ ⊆
Aut(W ), then, by applying Remark A.11.1 to W to obtain an Albanese morphism
W → B for W , one may construct an “Albanese morphism”
V →A
for V [i.e., which satisﬁes the universal property described in Remark A.11.1] by
forming the quotient B → A of B as in the proof of Corollary A.11, (ii): That
is to say, after reducing, via étale descent, to the case k = k, the action of Γ on
W induces an action of Γ by k-trans-homomorphisms on B, hence an action of
Γ by group scheme automorphisms on B, together with a twisted homomorphism
χ : Γ → B(k). Then we take B  A to be the quotient by the images of the
group scheme endomorphisms [arising from the group scheme action of Γ on B]
(1 − γ) : B → B, for γ ∈ Γ, and A  A to be the quotient by the image of the
homomorphism χ : Γ → A (k) determined by χ. If, moreover, V [i.e., W ] is k-toric,
then just as in the proof of Corollary A.11, (ii), we obtain a natural isomorphism
∼

Δab-t
→ ΔA
V
[where we use the notation “Δ(−) ” to denote the evident stack-theoretic generalization of this notation for varieties].
The content of more classical works [cf., e.g., [NS], [Chev]] written from the
point of view of birational geometry may be recovered via the following result.

Corollary A.12.

(Albanese Varieties and Birational Geometry)

(i) Let βV : V  → V be a proper birational morphism of normal varieties
def

∼

over k which restricts to an isomorphism βU : U  = V  ×V U → U over some
nonempty open subscheme U ⊆ V ; βA : A → A the induced morphism on Albanese varieties [cf. Corollary A.11, (i)]; W ⊆ V a k-toric open subscheme.

∼
Then the composite morphism U W → U → U  → V  → A extends uniquely
to a morphism W → A which induces a surjection ΔW  ΔA .
(ii) Let
. . . → V n → . . . → V 1 → V0 = V
be a sequence [indexed by the nonnegative integers] of birational morphisms of
complete normal varieties over k. Then there exists an integer N such that
for all n, m ≥ N , where n ≥ m, the induced morphism on Albanese varieties
An → Am is an isomorphism. If V is k-toric, then one may take N = 0.
Proof. First, we consider assertion (i). We may assume without loss of generality
that U ⊆ W . Then since V  → V is proper, and W is normal, it follows that
∼
the morphism U → U  → V  extends uniquely to an open subset W \ F ⊆ W ,
where F is a closed subscheme of codimension ≥ 2 in W . Thus, the fact that the
resulting morphism W \ F → V  → A extends uniquely to W follows immediately
from Lemma A.2. To verify the surjectivity of ΔW → ΔA , it suﬃces to verify the
surjectivity of ΔU → ΔA , i.e., of ΔU  → ΔV  → ΔA . On the other hand, this
follows from the surjectivity of ΔV  → ΔA [cf. Proposition A.3, (vii)], together
with the surjectivity of ΔU  → ΔV  [cf. the fact that U  ⊆ V  is a nonempty open
subscheme of the normal variety V  ].
Next, we consider assertion (ii). By Proposition A.6, (i), (ii) [cf. also Proposition A.3, (viii), (ix); Corollary A.11, (i)], each induced morphism on Albanese
varieties An → Am , for n ≥ m, is a surjection of abelian varieties which is an
isomorphism if and only if dimk (An ) ≤ dimk (Am ). On the other hand, if W ⊆ V
is any nonempty k-toric [e.g., k-smooth] open subscheme, whose Albanese morphism [cf. Corollary A.11, (i)] we denote by W → AW , then assertion (i) yields a
morphism W → An that induces a surjection ΔW  ΔAn , hence, in particular, a
morphism AW → An that induces a surjection ΔAW  ΔAn . But this implies that
dimk (An ) ≤ dimk (AW ), hence that for some integer N , dimk (An ) = dimk (Am ), for
all n, m ≥ N . In particular, if W = V , then dimk (An ) ≤ dimk (A0 ), for all n ≥ 0.
