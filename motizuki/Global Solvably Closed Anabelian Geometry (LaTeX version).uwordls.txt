Abstract.
In
this
paper,
we
study
the
pro-Σ
anabelian
geometry
of
hyperbolic
curves,
where
Σ
is
a
nonempty
set
of
prime
numbers,
over
Galois
groups
of
“solvably
closed
extensions”
of
number
ﬁelds
—
i.e.,
inﬁnite
extensions
of
number
ﬁelds
which
have
no
nontrivial
abelian
extensions.
The
main
results
of
this
paper
are,
in
essence,
immediate
corollaries
of
the
following
three
ingredients:
(a)
classical
results
concerning
the
structure
of
Galois
groups
of
number
ﬁelds;
(b)
an
anabelian
result
of
Uchida
concerning
Galois
groups
of
solvably
closed
extensions
of
number
ﬁelds;
(c)
a
previous
result
of
the
author
concerning
the
pro-Σ
anabelian
geometry
of
hyperbolic
curves
over
nonarchimedean
local
ﬁelds.

Introduction
In
this
paper,
we
study
various
properties
of
solvably
closed
Galois
groups
of
number
ﬁelds,
i.e.,
Galois
groups
of
ﬁeld
extensions
of
number
ﬁelds
that
admit
no
nontrivial
abelian
ﬁeld
extensions
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1,
(i)].
In
§1,
we
show
that
such
Galois
groups
satisfy
many
of
the
properties
of
absolute
Galois
groups
of
number
ﬁelds
that
are
of
importance
in
the
context
of
anabelian
geometry.
In
particular,
this
includes
properties
concerning
Galois
cohomology,
center-free-ness,
decomposition
groups
of
valuations,
and
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated
closed
normal
subgroups.
In
§2,
after
reviewing
a
fundamental
result
of
Uchida
[cf.
[11]]
to
the
eﬀect
that
solvably
closed
Galois
groups
of
number
ﬁelds
are
anabelian,
we
apply
the
various
results
obtained
in
§1
to
give
a
new
version
of
the
main
result
of
[6]
concerning
the
pro-Σ
anabelian
geometry
of
hyperbolic
curves,
where
Σ
is
a
nonempty
set
of
prime
numbers,
in
the
context
of
solvably
closed
Galois
groups
of
number
ﬁelds.
Finally,
in
§3,
we
observe
that
“relatively
small”
solvably
closed
Galois
groups
of
number
ﬁelds
exist
in
“substantial
abundance”.
For
instance,
in
the
case
of
punctured
elliptic
curves,
it
is
possible
in
many
instances
to
obtain
solvably
closed
Galois
groups
of
number
ﬁelds
that
are,
on
the
one
hand,
“large
enough”
to
be
compatible
with
the
outer
Galois
action
on
the
pro-Σ
geometric
fundamental
group
of
the
punctured
elliptic
curve
[i.e.,
in
the
sense
that
this
outer
Galois
action
of
the
Galois
group
of
the
number
ﬁeld
factors
through
the
quotient
determined
by
the
solvably
closed
extension],
but,
on
the
other
hand,
“small
enough”
to
be
linearly
disjoint

Basic
Properties
We
begin
by
deﬁning
the
notion
of
a
solvably
closed
Galois
group
of
a
number
ﬁeld
and
showing
that
such
Galois
groups
satisfy
many
properties
that
are
well-known
in
the
case
of
absolute
Galois
groups
of
number
ﬁelds.
Let
F
be
a
number
ﬁeld
[i.e.,
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
the
ﬁeld
of
rational
numbers],
F
an
algebraic
closure
of
F
,
and
F
⊆
F
a
[not
necessarily
ﬁnite!]
def
def
Galois
extension
of
F
.
Write
GF
=
Gal(F
/F
),
QF
=
Gal(F/F
).
Thus,
one
may
think
of
QF
as
a
quotient
GF

QF
of
GF
.
Deﬁnition
1.
(i)
We
shall
say
that
a
ﬁeld
is
solvably
closed
if
it
has
no
nontrivial
abelian
extensions.
If
F
is
solvably
closed,
then
we
shall
say
that
F/F
is
a
solvably
closed
extension
and
refer
to
QF
as
a
solvably
closed
Galois
group
of
the
number
ﬁeld
F
.
(ii)
If
G
is
any
proﬁnite
group,
and
p
is
a
prime
number,
then
we
shall
write
cdp
(G)
for
the
smallest
positive
integer
i
such
that
H
j
(G,
A)
=
0
for
all
continuous
p-torsion
G-modules
A
and
all
j
>
i,
if
such
an
integer
i
exists;
if
such
an
def
integer
i
does
not
exist,
then
we
set
cdp
(G)
=
∞
[cf.
[8],
Deﬁnition
3.3.1].
Remark
1.
Observe
that
the
Galois
group
QF
is
solvably
closed
if
and
only
if,
for
any
open
subgroup
HQ
⊆
QF
,
whose
inverse
image
in
GF
we
denote
by
HG
⊆
GF
,
the
surjection
induced
on
maximal
pro-solvable
quotients
sol
sol
HG

HQ
by
the
quotient
morphism
HG

HQ

Remark
2.
Thus,
if
we
denote
by
Fsol
⊆
F
the
maximal
solvable
[Galois]
extension
of
F
,
then
one
veriﬁes
immediately
that
Gal(Fsol
/F
)
is
a
solvably
closed
Galois
group
of
the
number
ﬁeld
F
.
In
particular,
[by
taking
F
=
F
,
it
follows
that]
the
maximal
pro-solvable
quotient
Gsol
F
of
GF
is
a
solvably
closed
Galois
group
of
the
number
ﬁeld
F
.
Remark
3.
One
veriﬁes
immediately
that
any
open
subgroup
of
a
solvably
closed
Galois
group
of
a
number
ﬁeld
is
again
a
solvably
closed
Galois
group
of
a
number
ﬁeld.
Proposition
2.1
(Galois
Cohomology
of
Solvably
Closed
Galois
Groups).
Suppose
that
QF
is
a
solvably
closed
Galois
group
of
the
number
ﬁeld
F
.
Then:
(i)
The
natural
surjection
GF

QF
induces
an
isomorphism
∼
H
i
(QF
,
A)
→
H
i
(GF
,
A)
for
all
continuous
torsion
QF
-modules
A
and
all
integers
i
≥
0.
In
particular,
if
F
contains
a
square
root
of
−1,
then
cdp
(QF
)
=
2
for
all
prime
numbers
p.
(ii)
Let
p
be
a
prime
number;
suppose
that
F
contains
a
primitive
p-th
root
of
unity.
Then
for
any
automorphism
σ
of
the
ﬁeld
F
that
preserves
and
acts
nontrivially
on
F
⊆
F,
the
automorphism
induced
by
σ
of
the
set
of
one-dimensional
Fp
-subspaces
of
the
Fp
-vector
space
H
2
(QF
,
Fp
)
is
nontrivial.
def
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
Write
JF
=
ker(GF

QF
).
To
show
the
desired
isomorphism,
it
follows
immediately
from
the
Leray-Serre
spectral
sequence
associated
to
the
extension
1
→
JF
→
GF
→
QF
→
1
that
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
H
i
(JF
,
A)
=
0
for
all
i
≥
1.
Since
H
i
(H,
A)
H
i
(JF
,
A)
∼
lim
=
−→
JF
⊆H⊆GF
[where
H
ranges
over
the
open
subgroups
of
GF
containing
JF
],
we
thus
conclude
the
desired
vanishing
as
follows:
If
i
≥
3,
then
the
fact
that
H
i
(H,
A)
=
0
follows
from
the
fact
that
cdp
(H)
≤
2,
for
H
suﬃciently
small
[i.e.,
H
that
correspond
to
totally
imaginary
extensions
of
F
—
cf.
[8],
Proposition
8.3.17].
If
i
=
2,
then
we
recall
that
by
the
well-known
4
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
“Hasse
Principle
for
central
simple
algebras”
[cf.,
e.g.,
[8],
Corollary
8.1.16;
the
discussion
of
[8],
§7.1],
it
follows
that
we
have
an
exact
sequence

H
2
(Gv
,
Fp
(1))
→
Fp
→
0
0
→
H
2
(GF
,
Fp
(1))
→
v
where
the
“(1)”
denotes
a
“Tate
twist”;
v
ranges
over
the
valuations
of
F
;
Gv
denotes
the
decomposition
group
of
v
in
GF
,
which
is
well-deﬁned
up
to
conjugation;
and
we
recall
in
passing
that
the
restriction
to
the
various
direct
summands
of
the
map
to
Fp
induces
an
isomorphism
H
2
(Gv
,
Fp
(1))
∼
=
Fp
for
all
nonarchimedean
v.
Thus,
by
applying
the
analogue
for
H
of
this
exact
sequence
for
GF
,
together
with
the
Grunwald-Wang
Theorem
[which
assures
the
existence
of
global
abelian
ﬁeld
extensions
with
prescribed
behavior
at
a
ﬁnite
number
of
valuations
—
cf.,
e.g.,
[8],
Corollary
9.2.3],
we
conclude
immediately
that
lim
H
2
(H,
A)
=
0
−→
H
[where
H
ranges
over
the
open
subgroups
of
GF
containing
JF
].
When
i
=
1,
the
fact
that
lim
H
1
(H,
A)
=
0
−→
H
follows
formally
from
the
deﬁnition
of
a
“solvably
closed”
Galois
group
[cf.
Deﬁnition
1,
(i)].
Now
the
statement
concerning
cdp
(QF
)
follows
immediately
from
the
isomorphism
just
veriﬁed,
together
with
the
fact
that,
if
F
contains
a
square
root
of
−1
[hence
is
totally
imaginary],
then
cdp
(GF
)
=
2
[cf.
[8],
Proposition
8.3.17;
the
exact
sequence
just
discussed
concerning
H
2
(GF
,
Fp
(1))].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Finally,
we
observe
that
assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
the
exact
sequence
just
discussed
concerning
H
2
(GF
,
Fp
(1))
∼
=
H
2
(QF
,
Fp
(1))
∼
=
H
2
(QF
,
Fp
)
[cf.
assertion
(i);
our
assumption
that
F
contains
a
primitive
p-th
root
of
unity],
together
with
Tchebotarev’s
density
theorem
[cf.,
e.g.,
[3],
Chapter
VIII,
§4,
Theorem
10],
which
implies
that
if
we
write
F0
⊆
F
for
the
subﬁeld
ﬁxed
by
σ,
then
there
exist
two
distinct
nonarchimedean
valuations
v1
,
v2
of
F0
that
split
completely
in
F
.
That
is
to
say,
if
w1
,
w2
are
valuations
of
F
lying
over
v1
,
v2
,
respectively,
then
there
exists
an
element
h
∈
H
2
(QF
,
Fp
)
∼
=
2
H
(GF
,
Fp
(1))
[where
we
note
that
this
isomorphism
is
compatible
with
the
natural
actions
by
σ,
up
to
multiplication
by
an
element
of
F×
p
]
which
maps
to
a
nonzero
element
of
the
direct
sum
in
the
above
sequence
whose
unique
nonzero
components
are
the
components
labeled

thus,

Remark
4.
As
was
pointed
out
to
the
author
by
the
referee,
one
may
generalize
Proposition
2.1,
(i),
substantially
if
one
assumes
the
Bloch-Kato
conjecture
—
i.e.,
the
assertion
that
the
cup
product
∪

H

(GK

Fp

→

a
surjection
for
every
integer
i
≥
1,
every
prime
number
p,
and
every
ﬁeld
K
of
characteristic
zero.
Indeed,
if
GK

QK
is
a
quotient
by
a

of
closed
normal
subgroup
JK
⊆
GK
corresponding
to
a
ﬁeld
extension
K
K
which
has
no
nontrivial
abelian
extensions,
then
to
show
that
the
natural
morphism
H
i
(QK
,
A)
→
H
i
(GK
,
A)
is
an
isomorphism
for
all
integers
i
≥
0
and
continuous
torsion
QK
-modules
A,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
[cf.
the
proof
of
Proposition
2.1,
(i)],
in
the
case
A
=
Fp
,
that
for
all
open
subgroups
H
⊆
GK
containing
JK
,
an
arbitrary
class
∈
H
i
(H,
A)
vanishes
upon
restriction
to
a
suﬃciently
small
open
sub
has
no
group
H1
⊆
H
containing
JK
;
but
this
follows
from
the
fact
that
K
nontrivial
abelian
extensions
if
i
=
1,
hence
by
the
Bloch-Kato
conjecture
if
i
≥
2.
Before
proceeding,
we
recall
that
a
proﬁnite
group
Δ
is
slim
if
every
open
subgroup
of
Δ
has
trivial
centralizer
in
Δ
[cf.
[5],
Deﬁnition
0.1,
(i)].
Corollary
2.2
(Slimness).
Every
solvably
closed
Galois
group
of
a
number
ﬁeld
is
slim.
Proof.
Suppose
that
QF
is
solvably
closed.
Let
HQ
⊆
QF
be
an
open
subgroup,
σ
∈
QF
an
element
of
the
centralizer
of
HQ
.
Write
FH
⊆
F
for
the
extension
of
F
deﬁned
by
HQ
.
Since
QF
is
solvably
closed,
by
taking
HQ
to
be
suﬃciently
small,
we
may
assume
that
FH
contains
a
p-th
root
of
unity,
for
some
prime
number
p.
Note
that
since
σ
commutes
with
HQ
,
it
follows
that
σ
acts
trivially
on
H
2
(HQ
,
Fp
).
Thus,
by
applying
Proposition
2.1,
(ii),
to
the
action
of
σ
on
F/FH
,
we
conclude
that
σ
acts
trivially
on
FH
,
i.e.,
that
σ
∈
HQ
.
On
the
other
hand,
since
HQ
may
be
taken
to
be
arbitrarily
small,
it
thus
follows
that
σ
=
1,
as
desired.

The
next
two
results,
concerning
decomposition
groups
and
topologically
ﬁnitely

closed

subgroups,
respectively,
are
well-known
in
the

Proposition
2.3
(Decomposition
Groups).
Suppose
that
QF
is
a
solvably
closed
Galois
group
of
the
number
ﬁeld
F
.
Let
v,
w
be
valuations
of
F
such
that
v
=
w;
write
Gv
,
Gw
⊆
QF
for
the
corresponding
decomposition
groups
[which
are
well-deﬁned
up
to
conjugation]
in
QF
and
Fv
,
Fw
for
the
corresponding
completions
of
F
.
Then:
(i)
Suppose
that
F
contains
a
square
root
of
−1,
and
that
v,
w
are
nonarchimedean;
let
K
be
a
ﬁnite
extension
of
Fv
.
Then
there
exists
a
ﬁnite
Galois
extension
of
F
contained
in
F
whose
restriction
to
Fv
contains
K
and
whose
restriction
to
Fw
is
the
trivial
extension.
(ii)
Suppose
that
v,
w
are
archimedean;
let
K
be
a
nontrivial
ﬁnite
extension
of
Fv
.
Then
there
exists
a
quadratic
extension
of
F
contained
in
F
whose
restriction
to
Fv
contains
K
and
whose
restriction
to
Fw
is
the
trivial
extension.
(iii)
The
surjection
GF

QF
induces
an
isomorphism
of
Gv
with
the
decomposition
group
of
v
in
GF
.
In
particular,
if
v
is
nonarchimedean,
then
Gv
is
slim
and
torsion-free.

(iv)
Gv
Gw
=
{1}.
(v)
Suppose
that
v
is
archimedean
(respectively,
nonarchimedean).
Then
the
normalizer
(respectively,
commensurator)
of
Gv
in
QF
is
equal
to
Gv
.
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
Since
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
Fv
is
pro-solvable
[cf.,
e.g.,
[8],
Chapter
VII,
§5],
we
may
assume,
by
recursion,
that
K
is
an
abelian
extension
of
Fv
.
Since,
moreover,
F
contains
a
square
root
of
−1,
it
follows
that
we
may
apply
the
Grunwald-Wang
Theorem
[cf.,
e.g.,
[8],
Corollary
9.2.3]
to
F
.
Now
assertion
(i)
follows
immediately
by
applying
the
Grunwald-Wang
Theorem
to
F
.
Assertion
(ii)
follows
by
considering
the
quadratic
extension
of
F
determined
by
taking
the
square
root
of
an
element
f
∈
F
which
is
<
0
at
v
and
either
>
0
or
nonreal
at
w
[where
we
note
that
the
existence
of
such
an
f
follows

from

fact
that

In
the
nonarchimedean

assertion

formally
from
assertion
(i),
together
with
the
well-known
facts
that
the

group
of
a
nonarchimedean
local
ﬁeld
is
slim
[cf.,

and
[of

cohomological
dimension

e.g.,
[8],
Corollary

hence]
torsion-free.
In
the
archimedean
case,
assertion
(iii)
follows,
for
instance,
by
considering
the
extension
of
F
obtained
by
adjoining
a
square
root
of
−1.
To
verify
assertion
(iv),
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
if
at
least
one
of
v,
w
is
nonarchimedean,
then

it
follows
from
the
torsion-free-ness
portion
of
assertion
(iii)
that
both
v,
w
are
nonarchimedean
[cf.
also
the
well-known
fact
that
the
absolute
Galois
group
of
an
archimedean
local
ﬁeld
is
ﬁnite,
of
order
≤
2!],
and,
moreover,
that
[from
the
point

view
of

one
may
replace
F
by
a

satisﬁes
the

Now
assertion
(iv)

Finally,

Theorem
2.4
(Topologically
Finitely
Generated
Closed
Normal
Subgroups).
Suppose
that
F
is
a
Galois
extension
of
the
number
ﬁeld
F
such
that
for
some
prime
number
p,
F
has
no
cyclic
extensions
of
degree
p
[e.g.,
a
solvably
closed
extension
of
F
].
Then
every
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated
closed
normal
subgroup
N
⊆
QF
is
trivial.
Proof.
Although
this
fact
only
follows
formally
from
the
statement
of
[2],
Proposition
16.11.6,
in
the
case
where
F
is
algebraically
closed,
as
was
explained
to
the
author
by
A.
Tamagawa,
the
proof
given
in
[2]
generalizes
immediately
to
the
case
of
arbitrary
F
[i.e.,
as
in
the
statement
of
Theorem
2.4]:
Indeed,
if
we
write
L
⊆
F
for
the
Galois
[since
N
is
normal]
ﬁeld
extension
of
F
determined
by
N
,
and
assume
that
N
is
nontrivial,
then
it
follows
that
there
exists
a
proper
normal
open
subgroup
N1
⊆
N
of
N
.
Thus,
N1
determines
a
ﬁnite
Galois
extension
L1
/L
of
degree
>
1.
Now
let
us
recall
that
number
ﬁelds
[such
as
F
]
are
Hilbertian
[cf.,
e.g.,
[2],
Theorem
13.4.2].
Thus,
by
[2],
Theorem
13.9.1,
(b)
[i.e.,
“Weissauer’s
extension
theorem
for
Hilbertian
ﬁelds”],
we
conclude
that
L1
is
Hilbertian,
hence,
by
[repeated
application
of]
[2],
Theorem
16.11.2,
that
L1
admits
Galois
extensions
with
Galois
group
isomorphic
to
a
product
of
an
arbitrary
ﬁnite
number
of
copies
of
Z/pZ.
By
our
assumption
on
F,
it
follows
that
such
Galois
extensions
of
L1
are
contained
in
F,
hence
that
N1
admits
ﬁnite
quotients
isomorphic
to
a
product
of
an
arbitrary
ﬁnite
number
of
copies
of
Z/pZ.
But
this
contradicts
the
assumption
that
N
is
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated.

Anabelian
Results
Next,
we
consider
the
anabelian
geometry
of
hyperbolic
curves,
in
the
context
of
solvably
closed
Galois
groups
of
number
ﬁelds.
The
following
result
is
due
to
K.
Uchida
[cf.
the
main
theorem
of
[11]]:
Theorem
3.1
(Solvably
Closed
Galois
Groups
are
Anabelian).
For
i
=
1,
2,
let
Fi
/Fi
be
a
solvably
closed
extension
of
a
number
ﬁeld
Fi
;
write
def
Qi
=
Gal(Fi
/Fi
).
Then
passing
to
the
induced
morphism
on
Galois
groups
determines
a
bijection
between
the
set
of
isomorphisms
of
topological
groups
∼
Q1
→
Q2
∼
and
the
set
of
isomorphisms
of
ﬁelds
F1
→
F2
that
map
F1
onto
F2
.
Next,
let
us
assume
that
we
have
been
given
a
hyperbolic
curve
[cf.,
e.g.,
[5],
§0,
for
a
discussion
of
hyperbolic
curves]
over
F
.
Let
Σ
be
a
nonempty
set
of
prime
numbers.
Write
ΔX
for
the
maximal
pro-Σ
quotient
of
the
geometric
fundamental
group
π1
(X
×F
F
)
of
X
[relative
to
some
basepoint].
Here,
we
note
in
passing
that
Σ
may
be
recovered
from
ΔX
as
the
set
of
prime
numbers
that
occur
as
factors
of
orders
of
ﬁnite
quotients
of
ΔX
.
Thus,
one
has
a
natural
outer
action
GF
→
Out(ΔX
)
of
GF
on
ΔX
.
Lemma
3.2
(Slimness).
ΔX
is
slim.
Proof.
This
follows
immediately
by
considering
Galois
actions
on
abelianizations
of
open
subgroups
of
ΔX
—
cf.
the
proof
of
[5],
Lemma
1.3.1,
in
the
case
where
Σ
is
the
set
of
all
prime
numbers.
Another
[earlier]
approach
to
proving
the
slimness
of
ΔX
is
given
in
[7],
Corollary
1.3.4.

Deﬁnition
2.
We
shall
say
that
the
[not
necessarily
solvably
closed!]
extension
F
/F
,
or,
alternatively,
the
Galois
group
QF
,
is
Σ-compatible
with
X
if
the
natural
outer
action
GF
→
Out(ΔX
)
GLOBAL
SOLVABLY
CLOSED
ANABELIAN
GEOMETRY
9
factors
through
the
quotient
GF

QF
.
Thus,
if
QF
is
Σ-compatible
with
X,
then
one
obtains
an
exact
sequence
of
proﬁnite
groups
1
→
ΔX
→
ΠX
→
QF
→
1
by
pulling
back
the
natural
exact
sequence
1
→
ΔX
→
Aut(ΔX
)
→
Out(ΔX
)
→
1
[which
is
exact
by
Lemma
3.2!]
via
the
resulting
homomorphism
QF
→
Out(ΔX
).
Here,
we
note
that
since
[it
is
an
easily
veriﬁed
tautology
that]
the
étale
fundamental
group
π1
(X)
of
X
may
be
recovered
as
the
result
of
pulling
back
this
natural
exact
sequence
via
the
homomorphism
GF
→
Out(ΔX
),
it
thus
follows
that
ΠX
may
be
thought
of
as
a
quotient
of
π1
(X).
Proposition
3.3
(Geometric
Subgroups
are
Characteristic).
For
i
=
1,
2,
def
let
Fi
/Fi
be
a
solvably
closed
extension
of
a
number
ﬁeld
Fi
;
Qi
=
Gal(Fi
/Fi
);
Σi
a
nonempty
set
of
prime
numbers;
Xi
a
hyperbolic
curve
over
Fi
with
which
Qi
is
Σi
-compatible;
1
→
ΔXi
→
ΠXi
→
Qi
→
1
the
resulting
exact
sequence
of
proﬁnite
groups
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2].
Then
any
isomorphism
of
topological
groups
∼
ΠX1
→
ΠX2
maps
ΔX1
isomorphically
onto
ΔX2
.
In
particular,
Σ1
=
Σ2
.
Proof.
We
give
two
proofs
of
Proposition
3.3.
The
ﬁrst
proof
consists
of
simply
observing
[cf.
the
proof
of
[5],
Lemma
1.1.4,
(i),
via
[5],
Theorem
1.1.2]
∼
that
the
image
of
ΔX1
under
the
composite
of
the
isomorphism
ΠX1
→
ΠX2
with
the
surjection
ΠX2

Q2
forms
a
topologically
ﬁnitely
generated
closed
normal
subgroup
of
Q2
,
hence
is
trivial,
by
Theorem
2.4.
The
second
proof
of
Proposition
3.3
only
uses
Theorem
2.4
in
the
wellknown
case
of
an
absolute
Galois
group
of
a
number
ﬁeld.
Moreover,
when
either
Σ1
or
Σ2
is
not
equal
to
the
set
of
all
prime
numbers,
then
this
second
proof
does
not
use
Theorem
2.4
at
all.
For
i
=
1,
2,
let
Hi
⊆
ΠXi
be
corresponding
[i.e.,
relative
to
the
given
∼
isomorphism
ΠX1
→
ΠX2
]
normal
open
subgroups;
write
Hi

Ji
for
the
quotients
determined
by
the
quotients
ΠXi

Qi
.
By
taking
the
Hi
to
be
suﬃciently
small,
we
may
also
assume
that
the
number
ﬁelds
determined
by
the
Ji
contain
square
roots
of
−1.
Thus,
by
Proposition
2.1,
(i),
it
follows
that
cdp
(Hi
)
=
2
+
d(p,
i)
10
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
where
d(p,
i)
is
equal
to
1
or
2
[depending
on
whether
Xi
is
aﬃne
or
proper]
∼
if
p
∈
Σi
and
d(p,
i)
=
0
if
p
∈
/
Σi
.
Since
H1
→
H2
,
we
thus
conclude
that
Σ1
=
Σ2
,
and
that
X1
is
aﬃne
if
and
only
if
X2
is.
Now
if
Σ1
=
Σ2
is
the
set
of
all
prime
numbers,
and
X1
,
X2
are
aﬃne,
then
it
follows
from
Matsumoto’s
injectivity
theorem
[cf.
[4],
Theorem
2.1]
that
the
ﬁeld
Fi
is
an
algebraic
closure
of
Fi
;
thus,
in
this
case,
Proposition
3.3
follows
from
[5],
Lemma
1.1.4,
(i)
[i.e.,
Theorem
2.4
for
absolute
Galois
groups
of
number
ﬁelds].
Next,
let
us
suppose
that
there
exists
a
prime
number
p
such
that
p
∈
/
Σ1
,
def
p∈
/
Σ2
.
This
implies
that
every
ﬁnite
quotient
group
of
Di
=
ker(Hi

Ji
)
has
order
prime
to
p,
hence
[by
consideration
of
the
Leray-Serre
spectral
sequence
associated
to
the
surjection
Hi

Ji
]
that,
for
i
=
1,
2,
the
natural
homomorphism
H
2
(Ji
,
Fp
)
→
H
2
(Hi
,
Fp
)
is
an
isomorphism.
In
particular,
it
follows
that
ΔXi
acts
trivially
on
H
2
(Hi
,
Fp
).
Thus,
the
natural
action
of
ΠXi
on
H
2
(Hi
,
Fp
)
factors
through
the
quotient
ΠXi

Qi
/Ji
.
Now,
by
taking
Hi
to
be
suﬃciently
small,
we
may
assume
[since
Qi
is
solvably
closed!]
that
the
extension
ﬁeld
of
Fi
determined
by
Ji
contains
a
primitive
p-th
root
of
unity.
Thus,
by
Proposition
2.1,
(ii),
we
conclude
that
the
action
of
Qi
/Ji
on
H
2
(Hi
,
Fp
)
is
faithful.
∼
∼
Since
the
isomorphism
ΠX1
→
ΠX2
induces
an
isomorphism
H1
→
H2
,
∼
hence
an
isomorphism
H
2
(H1
,
Fp
)
→
H
2
(H2
,
Fp
)
which
is
compatible
with
the
respective
actions
of
ΠX1
,
ΠX2
,
we
thus
conclude
that
the
isomorphism
∼
ΠX1
→
ΠX2
preserves
the
kernels
of
the
surjections
ΠXi

Qi
/Ji
,
hence
that
the
subgroup
ΔXi
=
ker(ΠXi

Qi
)
may
be
recovered
as
the
intersection
of
the
kernels
of
the
surjections
ΠXi

Qi
/Ji
,
by
letting
the
Hi
range
over
all
suﬃciently
small
normal
open
subgroups
of
ΠXi
.
This
completes
the
proof
of
Proposition
3.3
in
the
case
where
there
exists
a
prime
number
p
such
that
p∈
/
Σ1
,
p
∈
/
Σ2
.
Finally,
we
consider
the
case
where
X1
,
X2
are
proper.
Let
p
be
a
prime
number;
suppose
that
the
Hi
have
been
taken
to
be
suﬃciently
small
so
that
the
number
ﬁelds
determined
by
the
Ji
contain
a
primitive
p-th
root
of
unity
and
a
square
root
of
−1
[which,
by
Proposition
2.1,
(i),
implies
that
def
cdp
(Ji
)
=
2].
Since
Di
=
ker(Hi

Ji
)
also
satisﬁes
cdp
(Di
)
≤
2,
it
thus
follows
from
the
Leray-Serre
spectral
sequence
associated
to
the
extension
1
→
Di
→
Hi
→
Ji
→
1
that
there
is
a
natural
isomorphism
H
4
(Hi
,
Fp
)
∼
=
H
2
(Ji
,
Fp
)
⊗
H
2
(Di
,
Fp
)
which
is
compatible
with
the
natural
action
of
ΠXi
on
the
various
cohomology
modules
involved.
Here,
we
note
that
[by
the
well-known
structure

geometric
fundamental

ΔXi
⊆

acts
trivially
on
H

(Di

Thus,
Proposition
3.3
follows
in
the
present
case
by
applying
Proposition

(ii),
as
in
the
argument
given
in

(i)
Let

[Thus,
since
Δ

def
is
solvably
closed
—
cf.
Remark
2]
F
=
F1sol
of
F1
is
Σ-compatible
with
X.
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
Since
Δ
admits
a
base
of
characteristic
open
subgroups,
it
suﬃces
to
verify
assertion
(i)
when
Δ
is
a
ﬁnite
group
of
order
a
power
of
r.
But
then
consideration
of
the
[manifestly
characteristic!]
lower
central
series
of
Δ
reveals
that
any
automorphism
α
of
Δ
that
induces
the
identity
on
Δab
⊗
Fr
is
“unipotent
upper
triangular”
with
respect
to
the
ﬁltration
given
by
the
lower
central
series;
thus,
the
order
of
α
is
a
power
of
r.
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
Assertion
(ii)
follows
formally
from
assertion

Proposition
4.2
(Basic
Properties
of
Special
Linear
Groups).
Let
l
be
a
prime
number.
Write
SL2
(Fl
)
for
the
special
linear
group
of
2
by
2
def
matrices
with
coeﬃcients
in
Fl
,
P
SL2
(Fl
)
=
SL2
(Fl

(i)
Suppose
that
l
≥
5.
Then
P
SL2
(Fl
)
is
a
simple
ﬁnite
group.
(ii)
No
proper
subgroup
of
SL2
(Fl
)
surjects
onto
P
SL2
(Fl

(iii)
P
SL2
(F2
),
P
SL2
(F3
),
as
well
as
every
proper
subgroup
of
P
SL2
(Fl
)
[for
arbitrary
l],
is
either
solvable
or
isomorphic
to
P
SL2
(F5
).
Proof.
Assertions
(i),
(ii),
(iii)
are
well-known
—
cf.,
e.g.,
[10],
Chapter

Remark
5.
The
proper
subgroups
H
of
SL2
(Fl
)
may
be
analyzed
as
follows:
If
H
is
of
order
divisible
by
l,
then
H
contains
a
subgroup
U
of
order
l.
×
Since
F×
l
,
Fl2
are
of
order
prime
to
l,
such
a
subgroup
U
is
generated
by
a
unipotent
matrix;
thus,
[by
possibly
replacing
H

a
conjugate
of
H]

with
we
may
assume
that
U
is
generated
by
a
matrix
10
11
.
In
particular,
[as
is
well-known
or
easily
computed]
the
normalizer
of
U
is
given
by
the
solvable
subgroup
of
upper
triangular
matrices
of
SL2
(Fl
).
Thus,
if
U
fails
to
be
GLOBAL
SOLVABLY
CLOSED
ANABELIAN


normal
in
H,
the
fact
that
SL2
(Fl
)
is
generated
by
10
11
,
11
01
implies
that
H
=
SL2
(Fl
),
in
contradiction
to
our
assumption
that
H
is
proper.
That
is
to
say,
since
H
is
proper,
we
conclude
that
H
is
solvable,
as
desired.
On
the
other
hand,
if
the
order
of
H
is
prime
to
l,
then
H
may
be
classiﬁed
by
applying
the
Hurwitz
formula
to
the
tamely
ramiﬁed
Galois
covering
P1
→
P1
/H
[arising
from
the
natural
action
of
SL2
on
P1
,
where
Fl
is
an
l
l
l
algebraic
closure
of
Fl
],
which
gives
rise
to
fairly
restrictive
conditions
on
the
ramiﬁcation
indices
of
this
covering.
In
particular,
if
H
is
non-abelian,
then,
by
taking
an
appropriate
isomorphism
of
P1
/H
with
P1
,
one
concludes
l
l
that
this
covering
is
ramiﬁed
over
the
three
points
“0”,
“1”,
and
“∞”
of
P1
,
with
ramiﬁcation
index
2
at
“0”,
ramiﬁcation
index
∈
{2,
3}
at
“1”,
l
and
ramiﬁcation
index
∈
{3,
4,
5}
(respectively,
arbitrary,
≥
2)
at
“∞”
if
the
ramiﬁcation
index
at
“1”
is
equal
to
3
(respectively,
2).
Now
it
is
an
elementary
exercise
to
classify
the
possible
groups
H
that
may
occur.
For
instance,
by
considering
modular
curves,
it
follows
immediately
that
the
case
H
=
P
SL2
(F5
)
corresponds
to
the
case
where
the
ramiﬁcation
indices
are
(2,
3,
5).
Proposition
4.3
(Linear
Disjointness
I).
Let
l
>
5
be
a
prime
number;
r
a
def
prime
number
=
l;
Σ
=
{r};
X
a
once-punctured
elliptic
curve
over
a
number
ﬁeld
F
.
Suppose
further
that
F
contains
an
l-th
root
of
unity,
and
that
the
resulting
homomorphism
GF
→
SL2
(Fl
)
determined
by
the
action
of
the
absolute
Galois
group
GF
of
F
on
the
ltorsion
points
of
the
elliptic
curve
E
compactifying
X
is
surjective.
Then
there
exists
a
solvably
closed
extension
F/F
which
is
Σ-compatible
with
X,
and,
moreover,
linearly
disjoint
[over
F
]
from
the
extension
K
of
F
determined
by
the
kernel
of
the
homomorphism
GF
→
SL2
(Fl
).
Proof.
Write
L
⊆
K
for
the
extension
of
F
determined
by
the
kernel
of
the
homomorphism
GF
→
P
SL2
(Fl
)
[obtained
by
composing
the
homomorphism
GF
→
SL2
(Fl
)
with
the
natural
surjection
SL2
(Fl
)

P
SL2
(Fl
)].
Then
it
follows
immediately
from
Proposition
4.2,
(ii),
that
any
Galois
extension
of
F
is
linearly
disjoint
from
K
if
and
only
if
it
is
linearly
disjoint
from
L.
Now
observe
that
Gal(L/F
)
∼
=
P
SL2
(Fl
)
is
simple
[cf.
Proposition
4.2,
(i)]
and
non-abelian.
Thus,
by
Proposition
4.1,
(i),
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
the
ﬁnite
Galois
extension
R
of
F
determined
by
the
kernel
of
the
homomorphism
GF
→
GL2
(Fr
)
arising
from
the
Galois
action
on
the
r-torsion
14
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
points
of
E
is
linearly
disjoint
from
L.
On
the
other
hand,
again
since
Gal(L/F
)
is
simple
and
non-abelian,
this
linear
disjointness
property
follows
from
the
fact
[cf.
Proposition
4.2,
(iii);
our
assumption
that
r
=
l
>
5]
that
no
subquotient
of
GL2
(Fr
)
[or,
equivalently,
P
SL2
(Fr
),
since
P
SL2
(Fl
)
is
simple
and
nonabelian]
is
isomorphic
to
P
SL2
(Fl
).
This
completes
the
proof
of
Proposition
4.3.

Proposition
4.4
(Linear
Disjointness
II).
Let
l
>
5
be
a
prime
number;
Σ
a
nonempty
set
of
prime
numbers
such
that
l
∈
/
Σ;
X
a
once-punctured
elliptic
curve
over
a
number
ﬁeld
F
with
stable
reduction
over
the
ring
of
integers
OF
of
F
;
Fμ
the
extension
of
F
obtained
by
adjoining
an
l-th
root
of
unity.
Suppose
further
that
l
≥
[F
:
Q]
+
2;
that
[Fμ
:
F
]
divides
(l
−
1)/2
[which
implies
that
the
homomorphism
GF
→
P
GL2
(Fl
)
=
GL2
(Fl
)/F×
l
def
determined
by
the
action
of
the
absolute
Galois
group
GF
of
F
on
the
ltorsion
points
of
the
elliptic
curve
E
compactifying
X
factors
through
the
image
of
P
SL2
(Fl
)
in
P
GL2
(Fl
)];
that
the
resulting
homomorphism
GF
→
P
SL2
(Fl
)
is
surjective;
and
that,
for
each
prime
l
of
F
lying
over
l
at
which
E
has
bad
reduction,
the
following
condition
is
satisﬁed:
Write
F
for
the
completion
of
F
at
l.
Thus,
the
elliptic
curve
E
×F
F
is
a
Tate
curve,
hence
has
a
well-deﬁned
“q-parameter”
q
in
the
ring
of
integers
OF
.
Then
the
valuation
of
q
is
prime
to
l.
Then:
(i)
There
exists
an
extension
F/F
which
is
Σ-compatible
with
X,
and,
moreover,
linearly
disjoint
[over
F
]
from
the
extension
K
of
F
determined
by
the
kernel
of
the
homomorphism
GF
→
P
SL2
(Fl
).
(ii)
Write
Kμ
for
the
extension
of
F
determined
by
the
kernel
of
the
homomorphism
GF
→
GL2
(Fl
)
[arising
from
the
Galois
action
on
the
ldef
torsion
points
of
E].
Thus,
Fμ
⊆
Kμ
;
write
Fμ
=
Fμ
·
F
for
the
composite
extension
[over
F
].
Then
the
maximal
solvable
extension
Fμsol
of
Fμ
forms
a
solvably
closed
extension
of
Fμ
which
is
Σ-compatible
with
X
and,
moreover,
linearly
disjoint
over
Fμ
from
the
extension
Kμ
of
Fμ
.
Proof.
First,
we
consider
assertion
(i).
Let
F/F
be
the
extension
determined
by
the
kernel
of
the
homomorphism
GF
→
Out(ΔX
)
[cf.
Deﬁnition
2].
Let
l
be
a
prime
of
F
lying
over
l.
Since
P
SL2
(Fl
)
is
simple
[cf.
Proposition
GLOBAL
SOLVABLY
CLOSED
ANABELIAN
GEOMETRY
15
4.2,
(i)],
to
complete
the
proof
of
assertion
(i),
it
suﬃces
to
show
that
the
composite
[i.e.,
over
F
]
ﬁeld
extension
K
·
F
is
not
equal
to
F.
Thus,
suppose
that
K
·
F
=
F
.
Since
l
∈
/
Σ,
if
E
has
good
reduction
at
l,
then
it
follows
that
F/F
is
unramiﬁed
at
l;
similarly,
if
E
has
bad
reduction
at
l,
then
the
fact
that
l
∈
Σ
implies
that
F/F
is
tamely
ramiﬁed
at
l.
On
the
other
hand,
if
E
has
good
reduction
at
l,
then
the
fact
that
K
⊆
K
·
F
=
F
is
unramiﬁed
at
l
implies,
by
applying,
for
instance,
results
of
Raynaud
on
the
“fully
faithfulness
of
restriction
to
the
generic
ﬁber”
for
ﬁnite
ﬂat
group
schemes
over
moderately
ramiﬁed
discrete
valuation
rings
[cf.
[9],
Corollaire
3.3.6,
(1);
our
assumption
that
l
≥
[F
:
Q]
+
2,
which
implies
that
the
ring
of
integers
OF
is
indeed
“moderately
ramiﬁed”],
that,
if
we
write
E
for
the
stable
model
of
the
elliptic
curve
E
over
OF
and
E[l]
for
the
kernel
of
multiplication
by
l
on
E,
then
E[l]
may
be
written
as
a
direct
product
E[l]
∼
=G×G
of
two
copies
of
some
ﬁnite
ﬂat
group
scheme
G
over
OF
[which
implies,
for
instance,
that
the
tangent
space
of
E[l],
hence
also
of
E,
is
even-dimensional!]
—
a
contradiction.
Finally,
if
E
has
bad
reduction
at
l,
then
the
fact
that
K
⊆
K
·
F
=
F
is
tamely
ramiﬁed
at
l
contradicts
our
assumption
concerning
the
“valuation
of
the
q-parameter”
[which
implies
that
K
is
wildly
ramiﬁed
at
l].
This
completes
the
proof
of
assertion
(i).
To
verify
assertion
(ii),
let
us
ﬁrst
observe
that
by
Proposition
4.2,
(i)
[cf.
our
assumption
that
l
>
5],
(ii),
and
the
surjectivity
assumption
in
the
statement
of
the
present
Proposition
4.4,
we
have
Gal(Kμ
/Fμ
)
∼
=
SL2
(Fl
).
Now,
by
applying
Proposition
4.2,
(ii),
as
in
the
proof
of
Proposition
4.3,
assertion
(ii)
follows
immediately
from
assertion
(i),
together
with
the
simplicity
[and
non-solvability]
of
P
SL2
(Fl
).
