“ARITHMETIC
ELLIPTIC
CURVES
IN
GENERAL

(1.)
The
notation
“ordv
(−)
:
Fv
→
Z”
in
the
ﬁnal
sentence
of
the
ﬁrst
paragraph
following
Deﬁnition
1.1,
should
read
“ordv
(−)
:
Fv×
→
Z”.
(2.)
In
Deﬁnition
1.2,
(ii),
the
non-resp’d
and
ﬁrst
resp’d
items
in
the
display
should
be
reversed!
That
is
to
say,
the
notation
“α
F
β”
corresponds
to
“α(x)
−
β(x)
≤
C”;
the
notation
“α
F
β”
corresponds
to
“β(x)
−
α(x)
≤
C”.
(3.)
The
ﬁrst
portion
of
the
ﬁrst
sentence
of
the
statement
of
Corollary
4.4,
should
read:
“Let
Q
be
an
algebraic
closure
of
Q;
.
.
.
”.
(4.)
The
“log-diﬀMell
([EL
]))”
in
the
second
inequality
of
the
ﬁnal
display
of
the
statement
of
Corollary
4.4,
should
read
“log-diﬀMell
([EL
])”.
(5.)
The
equality
htE
≈
(deg(E)/
deg(ωX
))
·
htωX
implicit
in
the
ﬁnal
“≈”
of
the
ﬁnal
display
of
the
proof
of
Theorem
2.1,
should
be
replaced
by
an
inequality
htE

2
·
(deg(E)/
deg(ωX
))
·
htωX
[which
follows
immediately
from
Proposition
1.4,
(ii)],
and
the
expression
“deg(E)/
deg(ωX
)”
in
the
inequality
imposed
on
the
choice
of

should
be
replaced
by
the
expression
“2
·
(deg(E)/
deg(ωX
))”.
(6.)
The
phrase
“Corollary
2.1”
in
the
ﬁrst
paragraph
of
§2,
should
read
“Theorem
2.1”.
(7.)
The
inequality
“xS◦
≤
xS◦
”
at
the
end
of
the
second
to
last
sentence
of
the
proof
of
Corollary
4.3,
should
read
“xS◦
≤
xS•
”.
(8.)
Suppose
that
we
are
in
the
situation
of
Example
1.3,
(ii).
Let
U
⊆
X
be
an
open
subscheme.
Then
a
“compactly
bounded
subset”
KV
⊆
U
(Q)
(⊆
X(Q))
Typeset
by
AMS-TEX
1
2
SHINICHI
MOCHIZUKI
of
U
(Q)
is
to
be
understood
as
a
subset
which
forms
a
compactly
bounded
subset
of
X(Q)
[i.e.,
in
the
sense
discussed
in
Example
1.3,
(ii)]
and,
moreover,
satisﬁes

def
def
theproperty
that
for
each
v
∈
V
arc
=
V
V(Q)arc
(respectively,
v
∈
V
non
=
V
V(Q)non
),
the
compact
domain
Kv
⊆
X
arc
(respectively,
Kv
⊆
X(Qv
))
is,
in
fact,
contained
in
U
(C)
⊆
X(C)
=
X
arc
(respectively,
U
(Qv
)
⊆
X(Qv
)).
In
particular,
this
convention
should
be
applied
to
the
use
of
the
term
“compactly
bounded
subset”
in
the
statements
of
Theorem
2.1,
Lemma
3.7,
Theorem
3.8,
Corollary
4.4.
Although
this
convention
was
not
discussed
explicitly
in
Example
1.3,
(ii),
it
is,
in
eﬀect,
discussed
explicitly
in
the
discussion
of
“compactly
bounded
subsets”
at
the
beginning
of
the
Introduction.
Moreover,
this
convention
is
implicit
in
the
arguments
involving
compactly
bounded
subsets
in
the
proof
of
Theorem
2.1.
(9.)
In
the
discussion
following
the
second
display
of
Example
1.3,
(ii),
the
phrase
“(respectively,
X(Qv
))”
should
read
“(respectively,
X(Qv
))”.
(10.)
The
ﬁrst
display
of
the
paragraph
immediately
following
Remark
3.3.1,
should
read
as
follows:



2
def

α∧α

|α|
=

Ev
[i.e.,
the
integral
should
be
replaced
by
the
absolute
value
of
the
integral].
(11.)
In
the
discussion
following
the
ﬁnal
display
of
Example
1.3,
(ii),
the
phrase
“to
a
subset”
should
read
“to
a
subset
of”.
(12.)
In
the
text
immediately
following
the
ﬁrst
display
of
Deﬁnition
1.5,
(iv),
the
phrase
“conductor
of
x”
should
read
“conductor
of
x
[with
respect
to
D]”.
(13.)
The
following
phrase
should
be
added
to
the
end
of
the
third
sentence
[i.e.,
“Here,
the
condition
of
...”]
of
§3:
[cf.
the
conclusion
concerning
the
condition
“(b)”
in
Lemma
3.7].
(14.)
In
the
discussion
in
the
paragraph
immediately
preceding
Lemma
3.2
of
the
extension
class
associated
to
the
exact
sequence
of
GK
-modules
of
the
second
display
of
this
paragraph,
it
should
be
recalled
that
there
is
a
natural
isomorphism
between
the
group
of
extensions
Ext1GK
(Fl
,
Fl
(1))
and
the
cohomology
module
H
1
(GK
,
Fl
(1)).
(15.)
In
the
proof
of
Theorem
3.8,
the
text
“[which
has
the
eﬀect
of
...”
should
read
“[so
that
choosing
a
level
structure
on
the
3
·
5-torsion
points
has
the
eﬀect
of
...”.
(16.)
In
the
proof
of
Theorem
3.8,
the
text
“ﬁnite
primes
of
L”
should
read
“ﬁnite
primes
of
L
”.
