GEOMETRY OF CONFIGURATION SPACES”

(1.) The faithfulness referred to in the proof of Proposition 1.4 is well-known and
may be veriﬁed, for “N ” [cf. the notation of loc. cit.] suﬃciently small, by applying
a similar argument to the argument given in the proof of [DM], Lemma 1.14, i.e.,
by invoking the Lefshetz-Weil ﬁxed point formula.
(2.) The subscripted “ξ’s” in the ﬁrst two displays of the proof of Corollary 6.3
should, in fact, be superscripted.
(3.) In the proof of Corollary 6.3: Although there is no substantive problem with
the argument of the proof as written, the argument would perhaps be slightly easier
to follow if the phrase “is contained in a ﬁber subgroup” in the ﬁrst sentence of the
proof is replaced by the phrase “contains a ﬁber subgroup”.
