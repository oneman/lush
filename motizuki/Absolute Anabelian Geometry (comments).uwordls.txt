The
assumption
of
the
existence
of
a
splitting
over
some
open
subgroup
in
the
discussion
preceding
Lemma
1.1.4
is,
in
fact,
unnecessary,
at
least
in
the
context
of
Lemma
1.1.4.
Indeed,
this
assumption
is
never
applied
in
the
proof
of
Lemma
1.1.4,
(i).
In
the
proof
of
Lemma
1.1.4,
(ii),
this
assumption
is
applied;
on
the
other
hand,
the
application
of
this
assumption
may
be
circumvented
by
applying
instead


the
well-known
fact
that

In
the
Appendix,
the
phrase
“dual
graph
with
compact
structure”
should
read
“dual
semi-graph
with
compact
structure”.

The
ﬁnal
portion
(beginning
with
the
third
sentence)
of
the
second
paragraph
of
the
proof
of
Lemma
1.3.9
should
be
replaced
by
the
following
text:
Since
ri
may
be
recovered
group-theoretically,
given
any
ﬁnite
étale
coverings
Z
i
→
Vi
→
X
i
such
that
Zi
is
cyclic
(hence
Galois),
of
degree
a
power
of
l,
over
Vi
,
one
may
determine
group-theoretically
whether
or
not
Zi
→
Vi
is
totally
ramiﬁed
(i.e.,
at
some
point
of
Zi
),
since
this
condition
is
easily
veriﬁed
to
be
equivalent
to
the
condition
that
the
covering
Zi
→
Vi
admit
a
factorization
Zi
→
Wi
→
Vi
,
where
Wi
→
Vi
is
ﬁnite
étale
of
degree
l,
and
rWi
<
l
·
rVi
.
Moreover,
this
group-theoreticity
of
the
condition
that
a
cyclic
covering
be
totally
ramiﬁed
extends
immediately
to
the
case
of
pro-l
cyclic
coverings
Zi
→
Vi
.
Thus,
by
Lemma
1.3.7,
we
conclude
that
the
inertia
groups
of
cusps
in
(ΔXi
)(l)
(i.e.,
the
maximal
pro-l
quotient
of
ΔXi
)
may
be
characterized
(group-theoretically!)
as
the
maximal
subgroups
of
(ΔXi
)(l)
that
correspond
to
(proﬁnite)
coverings
satisfying
this
condition.
