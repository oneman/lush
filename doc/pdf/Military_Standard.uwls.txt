FOREWORD
1.
In
the
past
two
decades
MIL-STD-
188,
a
Military
Standard
covering
Military
Communication
System
Technical
Standards
,
has
evolved
from
one
applicable
to
all
military
communications
(MIL-STD-188,
MIL-STD-188A,
and
MIL-STD-188B)
to
one
applicable
to
tactical
communications
only
(MIL-STD-188C)
.
2.
In
the
past
decade,
the
Defense
Communications
Agency
(DCA)
has
published
DCA
Circulars
promulgating
standards
and
criteria
applicable
to
the
Defense
Communications
System
and
to
the
technical
support
of
the
National
Military
Command
System
(NMCS)
.
3.
Future
standards
for
all
military
communications
will
be
published
as
part
of
a
MIL-STD-188
series
of
documents
.
Military
Communication
System
Technical
Standards
will
be
subdivided
into
Common
Standards
(MIL-STD
-188-100
series)
,
Tactical
Standards
(MIL-STD-188-200
series)
,
and
Long
Haul
Standards
(MIL-STD-
188-300
series)
.
4.
This
document
deals
with
system,
subsystem,
and
equipment
standards
pertinent
to
multichannel
communications
circuits
which
traverse
both
long
haul
and
tactical
communications
systems
.
The
standards
contained
herein
are
common
to
both
systems
unless
stated
otherwise.
5.
Values
appearing
herein
may
differ
from
those
previously
published
in
MIL-STD-
188300,
based
on
later
data
or
errata
corrections
.
In
case
of
conflict,
MIL-STD-188-100
shall
govern
.

SCOPE
1.1
Purpose
.
This
document
provides
common
standards
(except
where
stated
otherwise
)
for
long
haul
and
tactical
communication
systems
.
It
specifies
electrical
channel
and
loop
characteristics
necessary
for
the
establishment
of
interconnecting
circuits
between
long
haul
and
tactical
users
for
voice
and
data
service
.
Parameters
are
provided
for
nominal
3-kHz
and
for
nominal
4-kHz
voice
bandwidth
circuits
between
two-wire
and
four-wire
users
.
Parameters
for
a
nominal
48-kHz
FDM
group
bandwidth
channel
are
provided
for
data
service
between
long
haul
and
tactical
less
maneuverable
users
.
1.2
Application.
This
standard
is
to
be
used
in
the
design
and
installation
of
new
communication
facilities
for
both
the
long
haul
and
tactical
systems
.
In
addition,
for
tactical
systems
,
this
standard
is
to
be
used
for
the
operation
of
new
communication
facilities
.
These
standards
are
not
applicable
to
commercially
leased
communications
facilities
.
In
a
few
cases
reference
is
made
to
other
documents
which
provide
standards
for
specific
applications
.
In
cases
of
conflict
between
this
Military
Standard
and
other
long
haul
or
tactical
standards
documents
,
the
standards
herein
will
prevail
.
It
is
not
intended
that
existing
systems
be
immediately
converted
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
this
Standard
.
New
systems
and
those
undergoing
major
modification
or
rehabilitation
must
conform
to
this
Standard
if
economically
feasible
.
Deviations
should
only
be
permitted
when
there
is
an
overriding
necessity
and
only
after
the
adverse
effects
of
the
deviation
on
such
factors
as
interoperation,
cost
training,
and
logistics
have
been
considered
.
The
standards
shall
be
adhered
to
in
development
of
new
equipment
and
facilities
,
but
care
should
be
exercised
that
the
standards
do
not
inhibit
advances
in
communications
technology.
Revisions
of
this
document
and
new
standards
for
the
future
will
be
generated
by
such
advances
in
technology
.
1.3
Technological
Level
of
Parameter
Values
.
The
parameters
contained
in
this
document
are
always
Communication
System
Standards
,
unless
a
parameter
is
specifically
identified
as
a
Design
Objective
(DO)
.

SYSTEM
STANDARDS
AND
DESIGN
OBJECTIVES
4.1
General
.
This
section
deals
with
overall
system
standards
and
design
objectives
for
telecommunications
traversing
long
haul
and
tactical
systems
.
These
overall
system
standards
include
those
user-to-user
requirements
and
hypothetical
reference
"
building
blocks"
which
are
essential
for
developing
overall
system
plans
and
subsystem
standards
.
General
remarks
about
the
systems
and
subsystems
with
which
this
document
is
concerned
follow.
Appendices
A
and
E
are
provided
to
explain
technical
facts
which,
in
the
past,
have
been
found
to
be
confusing.
Appendix
D
contains
information
on
standard
measuring
procedures
.
All
these
appendices
apply
to
appropriate
paragraphs
of
this
section
and
will
not
be
referenced
further.
4.1.1
Distinction
Between
Long
Haul
and
Tactical
Systems
.
A
precise
delineation
between
long
haul
and
tactical
communications
cannot
be
clearly
stated
because
characteristics
of
each
type
are
sometimes
identical
.
Generally,
the
long
haul
system
consists
of
fixed
or
recoverable
assets
and
is
described
in
greater
detail
in
Section
4
of
MIL-STD-188-300
.
Tactical
systems
range
from
highly
maneuverable
to
less
maneuverable
communications
and
even
some
fixed
installations
used
by
strategic
and
tactical
forces
for
support
of
military
operations
.
Tactical
communications
are
currently
further
described
in
Section
3
of
MIL-STD-188C
(to
be
replaced
by
MIL-STD-188-200
series
.
)
4.1.2
General
Description
of
Long
Haul/Tactical
Systems
.
4.1.2.1
Types
of
Traffic
.
The
long
haul/tactical
military
communications
circuits
provide
communications
service
in
every
essential
functional
area:
command
and
control,
logistics
,
intelligence
,
weather,
and
administration
.
Traffic
in
the
systems
may
be
in
the
form
of
voice,
graphics
,
teletypewriter,
and
data,
and
may
be
transmitted
either
as
analog
or
quasi
-analog
signals
,
or
as
digital
signals
.
The
systems
accept
traffic
from
and
deliver
to
individual
user
stations
and
other
systems
and
subsystems
.
4.1.2.2
Network.
An
electrical
communication
network
consists
of
a
number
of
user
stations
equipped
with
various
end
instruments
interconnected
by
transmission
facilities
,
which
may
be
either
direct
or
carried
through
one
or
more
nodes
or
centers
where
such
functions
as
switching,
patching,
processing,
service
supervision,
and
technical
control
may
be
provided
.
The
transmission
system
consists
of
all
the
transmission
circuits
between
user
stations
,
between
user
stations
and
nodes
,
and
between
nodes
.
It
may
make
use
of
several
means
of
electrical
signaling
over
metallic
or
radio
media
.
Extensive
use
is
made
of
multiplexing
to
obtain
various
numbers
of
channels
by
providing
parallel
,
simultaneous
paths
of
various
bandwidths
,
or
by
successively
assigning
the
entire
bandwidth
of
a
facility
to
each
of
a
number
of
channels
in
rapid
time
sequence
to
give
the
effect
of
parallel
continuous
channels
.
Transmission
circuits
may
be
used
in
a
variety
of
ways
,
and
may
be
considered
with
respect
to
their
functions
,
the
signal
modes
handled,
kind
of
multiplexing
used,
and
the
type
of
transmission
medium
over
which
they
are
provided
.
4.1.2.3
Signal
Modes
.
A
transmission
circuit
may
be
classified
by
the
signal
mode
it
is
designed
to
handle
.
Accepted
signals
may
be
continuous
or
discrete
signals
(frequently
called
"
analog"
and
"
digital"
signals
respectively)
.
In
general
,
the
transmission
requirements
for
these
two
signal
modes
vary
widely
.

4.1.2.3.1
Analog
Signals
.
Transmission
circuits
for
analog
signals
must
be
able
to
transmit,
with
acceptable
fidelity,
signals
that
may
take
any
value
within
specified
ranges
of
amplitude
,
frequency,
and
phase
.
They
cannot
be
provided
with
signal
regeneration,
since
there
is
no
physical
way
to
distinguish
the
desired
signal
from
noise
and
distortion
at
intermediate
or
receiving
points
.
However,
their
amplitude
may
be
restored
by
amplification.
4.1.2.3.2
Digital
Signals
.
Transmission
circuits
for
digital
signals
are
only
required
to
transmit
signals
constrained
to
two
or
more
defined
and
discrete
states
.
For
example,
a
binary
digital
link
can
only
handle
signals
which
alternate
between
two
states
,
such
as
marking
and
spacing,
1
and
0
,
on
and
off,
etc.
The
signal
which
is
transmitted
between
transitions
from
one
state
to
another
is
a
"
signal
element"
.
In
a
binary
system
a
signal
element
represents
one
bit,
that
is
,
either
1
or
0.
In
a
quaternary
digital
system,
e.g.
,
a
four-phase
system,
four
discrete
states
may
be
transmitted;
therefore,
each
signal
element
represents
two
bits;
that
is
,
for
the
first
and
second
of
a
pair
of
adjacent
bits
in
the
input,
the
four
available
signals
are
assigned
values
of
"
1
,
1
"
;
"
1
,
0"
;
0,
1
"
;
and
"
0,
0"
.
Due
to
the
discrete
nature
of
signals
,
digital
circuits
can
be
provided
with
signal
regeneration
because,
in
general,
the
receiving
device
selects
the
output
state
which
most
closely
corresponds
with
the
signal
state
received
if
the
signal
is
above
threshold.
4.1.2.3.3
Quasi
-Analog
Signals
.
An
analog
circuit
can
be
the
medium
for
the
transmission
of
digital
signals
if
they
are
converted
into
a
form
which
meets
the
specifications
of
an
analog
circuit.
Therefore
,
a
system
may
be
designed
to
transmit
digital
signals
over
an
analog
circuit,
by
choosing
a
suitable
frequency,
modulation
principle
,
and
power
level
appropriate
to
the
characteristics
of
the
medium
providing
the
analog
circuit.
For
example
,
physical
wire
circuits
working
at
audio
frequency
throughout
will
allow
almost
any
modulation
principle
to
be
used
.
Analog
circuits
provided
over
frequency
division
multiplexing
systems
with
independent
carrier
generation
may
suffer
audio
frequency
displacement;
the
modulation
scheme
for
the
quasi
-analog
equipment
must
allow
for
this
.
Some
radio
transmission
systems
suffer
multipath
effects
which
may
persist
for
a
number
of
milliseconds
;
in
such
cases
,
signal
element
durations
longer
than
the
multipath
delays
offer
one
method
of
coping
with
the
problem
and,
in
turn,
this
may
require
transmission
on
a
number
of
parallel
frequency
channels
.
An
important
consideration
in
the
use
of
quasi
-analog
signal
transmission
is
that
as
long
as
digital
signals
remain
in
the
quasi
-analog
form,
no
full
regeneration
(retiming
and
reshaping)
can
be
performed
on
them.
Should
regeneration
be
required
the
signal
is
usually
demodulated
and
restored
to
digital
form
.
Also
,
all
the
anomalies
of
the
analog
media
such
as
thermal
,
impulse,
and
fading-connected
noise
,
phase
jitter,
envelope
delay
distortion,
frequency
bandwidth
reduction,
and
level
variations
,
tend
to
accumulate
along
the
circuit
.
Over
a
sufficiently
long
analog
circuit,
these
effects
may
cause
the
receiving
device
to
make
a
large
number
of
errors
.
NOTE:
Noise
impairments
of
TDM
transmission
are
covered
in
paragraph
4.4.3.
4.1.2.4
Multiplexing
Subsystems
.
Transmission
links
may
be
provided
by
nonmultiplexed
or
by
multiplexed
facilities
.
In
general
,
multiplexed
facilities
are
divided
into
frequency
division
multiplexing
and
time
division
multiplexing
.
Each
method
has
distinctive
characteristics
affecting
the
objectives
and
use
of
circuits
so
derived
.

4.1.2
.2.4.1
Nonmultiplexed
Circuits
.
Multipair
cables
provide
parallel
pairs
for
simultaneous
transmission
of
signals
along
the
route
.
This
is
often
referred
to
as
space
division
multiplexing
.
4.1.2.4.2
Frequency
Division
Multiplexing
(FDM)
Subsystems
.
FDM
is
a
method
of
deriving
two
or
more
simultaneous
,
continuous
channels
from
a
transmission
medium
connecting
two
points
by
assigning
separate
portions
of
the
available
frequency
spectrum
to
each
of
the
individual
channels
.
The
most
extensive
exploitation
of
this
principle
is
the
transmission
plant
which
provides
message
quality
telephone
circuits
occupying
adjacent
nominal
4
-kHz
slots
in
wideband
media
,
both
metallic
and
radio
,
and
provides
an
effective
bandwidth
from
about
300
Hz
to
3400
Hz
.
The
procedures
for
placing
many
telephone
channels
in
adjacent
positions
in
multiplex
basebands
extending
to
12
MHz
and
higher
have
become
highly
standardized
and
the
practices
for
utilizing
the
available
spectrum
,
which
are
followed
by
the
North
American
companies
and
those
recommended
by
the
CCITT
and
CCIR,
follow
similar
principles
.
Military
practice
is
characterized
by
extensive
use
of
modular
principles
.
Common
practice
is
to
assemble
twelve
voice
channels
by
modulation
processes
in
the
basic
group
frequency
band
60
kHz
to
108
kHz
,
called
"
group
B"
bythe
CCITT,
where
they
appear
as
lower
sidebands
of
twelve
carrier
frequencies
.
This
group
is
the
basic
building
block
of
larger
subsystems
.
Five
such
groups
(60
channels)
are
assembled
by
further
modulation
processes
to
adjacent
positions
in
the
basic
supergroup
frequency
band,
312
kHz
to
552
kHz
.
Larger
subsystems
extend
this
principle
by
further
higher
order
groupings
,
such
as
mastergroups
and
supermastergroups
,
to
provide
a
maximum
of
2700
voice
channels
in
a
nominal
12-MHz
band,
and
a
correspondingly
greater
number
of
voice
channels
in
still
wider
basebands
.
4.1.2.4.3
Time
Division
Multiplexing
(TDM)
Subsystems
.
TDM
is
a
method
of
deriving
two
or
more
apparently
simultaneous
channels
from
a
given
frequency
spectrum
of
a
transmission
medium
connecting
two
points
by
assigning
the
entire
spectrum
to
the
different
channels
at
different
times
(usually
at
regular
intervals
and
by
automatic
distribution)
.
In
general
,
pulse
transmission
is
used
in
TDM.
The
multiplexed
pulse
train
may
be
considered
to
be
the
interleaved
pulse
trains
of
the
individual
channels
.
The
individual
channel
pulses
may
be
modulated
in
an
analog
or
a
digital
manner
.
Digital
information
transmitted
over
the
TDM
subsystem
on
an
element
for
element
basis
requires
that
either
the
contributing
individual
channels
be
held
in
bit
synchronism
with
the
TDM
subsystem
or
that
some
form
of
buffering
be
employed
.
4.1.2.5
Analog
to
Digital
Conversion
Techniques
.
4.1.2.5.1
Pulse
Modulation
(Analog
or
Non-
Discrete)
.
The
stream
of
pulses
representing
a
given
channel
may
be
modulated
to
carry
analog
information
by
changing
a
selected
parameter
of
each
pulse
over
a
continuous
range
of
values
within
specified
limits
.
The
pulse
rate
must
be
adequate
to
preserve
all
essential
analog
information
.
This
is
achieved
by
using
a
sampling
rate
at
least
twice
as
high
as
the
highest
frequency
in
the
analog
channel
(Nyquist
rate)
.
The
selected
parameter
may
be
pulse
amplitude,
duration,
or
timing.
In
pulse
amplitude
modulation
(
PAM)
the
amplitude
is
varied
in
an
analog
manner
while
the
duration
and
timing
are
constant;
in
pulse
duration
modulation
(PDM
)
the
amplitude
and
timing
remain
constant
while
the
duration
varies
according
to
the
11
MIL-STD-
188-100
15
November
1972
sampling
information;
in
pulse
position
modulation
(
PPM)
the
amplitude
and
duration
of
pulses
are
constant,
while
the
relative
time
of
arrival
of
each
pulse
with
respect
to
a
nominal
time
is
varied
.
Transmissions
with
analog
pulse
modulation
are
not
digital
;
that
is,
they
cannot
be
regenerated
since
the
receiver
has
no
way
to
distinguish
the
desired
signal
modulation
from
the
effects
of
distortion
and
noise,
although
the
unmodulated
characteristics
of
pulses
can
be
restored
.
An
analog
pulse
modulation
scheme
may
handle
both
analog
signals
and
quasi-analog
signals
,
the
latter
representing
digital
data
.
Pulse
Modulation
(
Digital
or
Discrete)
.
With
digital
pulse
modulation,
a
selected
parameter
of
each
pulse
is
varied
in
a
discrete
manner;
that
is
,
each
pulse
is
constrained
to
assume
one
state
out
of
a
set
of
two
or
more
defined
and
discrete
states
.
4.1.2.5.2
Such
a
signal
may
be
regenerated
because
the
receiving
device
can
be
designed
so
that
it
is
limited
to
assume
a
set
of
output
states
which
correspond
to
the
states
of
the
transmission
signal
.
If
noise
or
distortion
,
or
both,
induce
the
receiver
to
select
an
erroneous
output
state,
the
analog
causes
of
the
digital
error
are
liquidated;
the
error
is
"
clean
.
"
Therefore
,
the
noise
and
distortion
do
not
have
cumulative
effects
as
such;
only
the
errors
add
up
.
The
same
parameters
used
in
analog
pulse
modulation
may
also
be
used
for
digital
modulation
.
The
amplitude
may
be
varied
in
steps
(this
includes
reversal
in
polarity
or
phase)
,
the
duration
may
be
varied
in
steps
or
the
pulse
position
may
be
discretely
varied
.
In
radio
systems
,
pulses
are
represented
by
groups
of
carrier
frequency
oscillations
;
in
metallic
systems
,
either
carrier
or
"
direct
current"
pulses
may
be
used
.
Analog
information
may
be
transmitted
over
a
digital
subsystem
if
it
is
first
placed
in
digital
form
.
This
requires
that
the
analog
values
be
quantized
and
in
some
cases
coded
.
In
pulse
code
modulation
(
PCM)
the
designation
of
the
quantum
level
is
generally
expressed
in
binary
code
.
Since
the
stairstep
nature
of
a
quantized
signal
prevents
it
from
perfectly
representing
a
smooth
wave
,
quantizing
error
or
distortion
is
produced
.
This
is
minimized
by
adopting
a
relatively
large
number
of
quantizing
levels
.
Differential
PCM
and
delta
modulation
operate
on
similar
principles
except
that
the
digital
code
transmitted
is
based
on
the
change
from
the
preceding
sampling
time
rather
than
the
total
amplitude
value
.
NOTE
:
Parameters
for
differential
PCM
and
for
delta
modulation
are
not
included
in
this
document
since
standards
for
these
digital
modulation
schemes
have
not
yet
been
established
.
Speech
transmitted
in
coded
digital
form
does
not
suffer
directly
from
analog
noise
and
distortion
of
the
transmission
medium
.
The
errors
in
the
received
code
will
have
a
random
noise
effect
on
the
recovered
speech,
as
opposed
to
the
progressive
analog
degradation
in
bandwidth
and
speech-to
-noise
ratio
which
occurs
in
very
long
analog
circuits
.
In
addition,
loss
of
synchronization,
drop-outs
,
and
similar
signal
discontinuities
in
PCM
transmission
can
cause
a
distinct
clicking
noise
at
the
telephone
receiver
.
4.1.2.6
Transmission
Media
.
The
transmission
facilities
for
links
may
be
pro-
vided
by
metallic
lines
or
radio
.
The
latter
may
be
divided
into
relatively
stable
media
such
as
millimeter
and
microwave
line
of
sight
(
LOS)
and
satellites
,
varying
media
such
as
tropospheric
scatter,
and
those
media
subject
to
wide
and
often
prolonged
variations
,
such
as
high
frequency
(HF)
radio
subsystems
.

4.1.2.6.1
Metallic
Lines
.
The
term
metallic
lines
includes
all
facilities
obtained
by
use
of
twisted
pair
cable,
multipair
cable
,
coaxial
cable
,
and
waveguides
.
Characteristics
of
these
lines
which
affect
the
parameters
of
transmission
systems
designed
to
operate
over
them
include
attenuation,
noise,
and
mutual
coupling.
Attenuation
increases
continuously
and
smoothly
with
increase
of
frequency
and
is
also
sensitive
to
temperature
.
Noise
on
metallic
lines
can
be
induced
by
electric
power
systems
and
crosstalk
from
other
similar
parallel
circuits
,
the
latter
tending
to
rise
with
volume
of
traffic
.
Impulse
noise
may
also
be
introduced
by
natural
static
,
transients
from
signaling
circuits
,
and
switching
transients
from
power
systems
.
In
some
areas
,
electric
railways
,
local
rail
services
,
and
radar
equipment
may
introduce
noise
.
In
the
case
of
baseband
dc
digital
transmission
over
metallic
circuits
,
the
cable
shunt
capacitance
is
the
principal
factor
which
determines
the
upper
bound
of
the
data
signaling
rate
.
In
the
case
of
quasi
-analog
data
transmission
via
FDM
subsystems
,
the
insertion
loss
versus
frequency
characteristic,
envelope
delay
distortion,
and
noise
are
the
limiting
factors
of
the
modulation
rate
.
4.1.2.6.2
Radio
Relay
Subsystems
.
The
term
radio
relay
is
generally
applied
to
radio
subsystems
which
are
suitable
for
the
application
of
either
FDM
or
TDM
and
which
operate
in
radio
frequency
bands
where
transmission,
while
varying
continually
within
a
restricted
range,
is
relatively
stable
.
The
radio
spectrum
classified
as
VHF,
UHF,
and
SHF
is
currently
exploited
by
radio
relay
subsystems
of
various
types
.
The
channel
capacity
of
these
subsystems
varies
from
about
twelve
to
hundreds
of
channels
.
The
loosely
defined
term
"
microwave"
is
also
commonly
applied
to
such
subsystems
.
Although
several
types
of
radio
propagation
may
be
present
at
the
same
time
over
a
given
section,
radio
paths
for
radio
relay
subsystems
generally
may
be
classified
as
line
of
sight,
forward
scatter,
and
satellite
relay
.
In
general,
an
important
characteristic
of
radio
relay
subsystems
is
the
use
of
highly
directional
antenna
configurations
,
which
may
allow
extensive
duplication
of
radio
frequency
channel
assignments
in
a
relatively
small
geographical
area
.
4.1.2.6.3
High
Frequency
(HF)
Radio
Subsystems
.
Radio
subsystems
using
frequencies
lower
than
about
30
MHz
are
subject
to
wide
level
changes
due
to
slow
and
rapid
fading
.
This
may
affect
various
frequencies
differently
even
in
the
same
audio
channel
bandwidth
.
Offsetting
this
handicap
is
their
range,
made
possible
by
the
reflection
or
refraction
properties
of
the
ionosphere,
when
frequencies
appropriate
to
the
time
of
day,
season,
and
distance
are
chosen
.
The
range
of
such
HF
subsystems
makes
them
useful
for
maintaining
contact
with
tactical
forces
with
wide
operating
radii
,
although
such
circuits
are
frequently
of
low
performance
.
Due
to
the
congested
spectrum
conditions
,
telephone
channels
are
limited
to
a
3-kHz
maximum
audio
input,
and
single
sideband
and
independent
sideband
techniques
are
widely
used
for
spectrum
efficiency
.
4.1.2.6.4
Radio
Subsystems
Below
HF
.
Radio
subsystems
using
waves
classified
as
MF
,
LF,
VLF,
ILF
,
and
ELF
have
propagation
characteristics
which
are
relatively
stable
and
which
may
cover
long
distances
.
They
are
used
for
special
purposes
such
as
reaching
mobile
and
fixed
elements
capable
of
being
located
anywhere
in
the
world
.
Standards
for
radio
subsystems
below
HF
are
not
included
in
this
document
.

consists
of
a

and
a
tactical
user
which
are
interconnected
by
a
transmission
circuit
transversing
both
the
long
haul
network
and
the
tactical
network
(see
subparagraph
4.1.2.2)
.
The
user

end
instrument
may
be
an
analog
device
(see
paragraph
5.7)
or
a
digital
device
(see
paragraph
5.8)
.
The
transmission
circuit
may
consist
of
a
long
haul
circuit
and
a
tactical
circuit
with
an
interface
at
a
technical
control
facility.
The
basic
communication
system
configurations
are
represented
by
Figure

.

shows
two

instruments
interconnected
by
an

circuit
through
the
use
of

equipment
.
The

is
required
to
interface
the
digital
end
instruments
with
the
transmission
circuit
(see
subparagraph
4.
1.
2.4.3)
.
Where
it
is
desired
to
interface
with
an
analog
circuit,
the
data
communication
equipment
converts
the
binary
dc
signals
into
a
quasi
-analog
signal
(see
subparagraph
4.1.2.3.3)
.
The
basic
system
configurations
as
represented
by
Figure
4.1-1
are
not
inclusive
of
all
possible
user-transmission
circuit
variations
.
However,
these
system
configurations
are
considered
as
basic
system
layouts
.
In
paragraph
4.1.1,
a
distinction
is
made
between
tactical
and
long
haul
communications
.
Long
haul
communications
are
characterized
by
the
global
distances
traversed;
hence
,
the
allocation
of
electrical
characteristics
for
the
different
links
and
sections
must
inherently
be
more
stringent
than
those
for
the
relatively
short
distances
traversed
by
tactical
communications
.
This
is
valid
for
any
analog
FDM
or
analog/digital
(FDM/TDM
)
transmission
subsystem.
The
requirements
for
some
tactical
communication
systems
are
not
only
different
from
those
for
long
haul
communications
but
a
further
distinction
must
be
made
between
highly
maneuverable
and
less
maneuverable
tactical
system
configurations
.
In
a
tactical
highly
maneuverable
system
the
maximum
nominal
distance
over
which
switched
communication
is
required
has
been
taken
as
300
kilometers
(km)
or
167
nautical
miles
(nmi)
;
the
transmission
performance
of
a
hypothetical
reference
system
for
such
a
distance
will
be
published
in
MIL-
STD-188-200
series
.
When
a
FDM
circuit
of
a
tactical
highly
maneuverable
system
is
connected
in
tandem
with
a
long
haul
circuit
nominally
22
,
000
km
(12,000
nmi)
long
,
then
the
length
of
the
tactical
circuit
is
limited
to
keep
the
total
circuit
noise
,
user-to
-user,
at
an
acceptable
level
(see
Figure
4.7-3,
page
103)
.
Examples
of
hypothetical
common
long
haul/tactical
highly
maneuverable
reference
circuits
with
performance
parameters
are
given
in
paragraph
4.7
.
The
tactical
less
maneuverable
system
would
be
expected
to
meet
much
longer
distance
requirements
than
the
tactical
highly
maneuverable
system
.
In
a
tactical
less
maneuverable
system
the
maximum
nominal
distance
over
which
switched
communication
is
required
has
been
taken
as
1850
km
(1000
nmi)
;
the
transmission
performance
of
a
hypothetical
reference
system
for
such
a
distance
will
be
published
in

nominally
1850

Parameters
for
Analog
Service
.
4.2.1
General
.
The
following
subparagraphs
4.2.2.1
through
4.2.3.8
deal
with
standards
and
design
objectives
for
voice
(subparagraph
4.2.2)
and
facsimile
(subparagraph
4.2.3)
transmission
over
voice
bandwidth
circuits
on
a
user-to-user
basis
between
the
line
terminals
of
the
end
instruments
of
a
common
long
haul/tactical
circuit
.
These
standards
and
design
objectives
are
expressed
in
the
form
of
technical
parameters
,
such
as
received
noise
power
or
transmitted
bandwidth,
which
shall
be
achieved
on
all
common
long
haul/tactical
voice
circuits
regardless
of
user-to
-user
distances
of
up
to
approximately
22
,
000
km
(12,000
nmi
)
,
transmission
media,
and
multiplexing
scheme
used
(FDM,
TDM,
or
a
mix
of
FDM
and
TDM)
.
Part
of
these
parameters
are
stated
as
design
objectives
rather
than
as
standards
due
to
a
lack
of
measured
and
verified
data
available
at
the
present
time
or
due
to
a
lack
of
general
consensus
in
the
interpretation
of
the
data
.
4.2.2
Parameters
for
Voice
Service
.
4.2.2.1
Transmitted
Speech
Volume
.
The
talker
volume
distribution
at
the
line
terminals
of
a
telephone
set
has
been
found
to
approximate
a
normal
or
Gaussian
distribution
when
expressed
in
Volume
Units
(VU)
.
Based
on
the
talker
volume
distribution,
the
transmitted
mean
speech
volume
of
a
two-wire
as
well
as
a
four
-wire
telephone
set
used
in
either
a
long
haul
or
tactical
system
is
assumed
to
be
-10
VU
with
a
standard
deviation
(sigma)
of
5
VU
.
4.2.2.2
Received
Speech
Volume
.
Subjective
tests
indicate
that
received
speech
volume
at
the
line
terminals
of
the
listener
telephone
set
from
-21.5
VU
to
-33.5
VU
results
in
satisfactory
service
.
The
mean
received
speech
volume
at
the
line
terminals
of
the
listener
telephone
set
should
be
nominally
-28
VU
.
Table
4.2-1
shows
the
relationship
between
received
speech
volume
and
the
percentage
of
calls
rated
good
or
better
when
the
associated
noise
level
is
acceptably
low

the
values

Experience
has
shown
that
mean
received
speech
volumes
in
a
tactical
field
environment
have
to
be
higher
than
-28
VU
for
satisfactory
service
due
to
a
generally
higher
background
noise

and
to
higher

4.2.2.3
Received
Noise
Power.
With
a
mean
received
speech
volume
of
-28
VU
the
value
of
noise
power
for
acceptable
service
has
been
set
at
44
dBrnc
(DO:
38
dBrnc)
at
the
line
terminals
of
the
listener
telephone
set
(see
Figure
4.2-1
)
.
This
is
the
total
noise
contribution
from
all
sources
.
4.2.2.4
Insertion
Loss
Versus
Frequency
Characteristic
.
The
insertion
loss
versus
frequency
characteristic
referenced
to
1000
Hz
,
over
the
frequency
bandwidth
from
400
Hz
to
2800
Hz
,
shall
be
within
the
limits
of
-8
dB
to
+20
dB,
except
over
the
frequency
bandwidth
from
600
Hz
to
2400
Hz
it
shall
be
within
the
limits
of
-7
dB
to
+12
dB.
The
insertion
loss
below
400
Hz
and
above
2800
Hz
shall
be
equal
to
or
greater
than
-8
dB.
Loss
is
indicated
by
a
(+)
and
gain
by
a
(-)
sign
(see
Figure
4.2-2)
.
Insertion
loss
versus
frequency
characteristic
for
data
service
is
given
in
subparagraphs
4.3.2.5
and
4.3.3.5
.
4.2.2.5
Envelope
Delay
Distortion
.
No
standard
or
design
objective
is
given
for
envelope
delay
distortion
with
regard
to
voice
service
since
the
human
ear
is
not
sensitive
to
this
type
of
distortion
.
However,
delay
distortion
plays
a
significant
role
in
data
transmission
through
audio
channels
.
Envelope
delay
distortion
for
data
service
is
given
in
subparagraphs
4.3.2.6
and
4.3.3.6
.
4.2.2.6
Single
Tone
Interference
.
No
interfering
tone
of
a
single
frequency
shall
exceed
30
dBrnc
(DO:
24
dBrnc)
,
measured
at
the
line
terminals
of
the
listener
telephone
set
.
4.2.2.7
Crosstalk.
Subjective
listener
tests
have
indicated
that
intelligible
crosstalk
is
more
disturbing
than
unintelligible
crosstalk
of
the
same
level
.
Therefore,
a
distinction
is
made
between
intelligible
and
unintelligible
crosstalk
even
if
no
objective
measurement
technique
exists
to
separate
these
two
crosstalk
components
.
Unintelligible
crosstalk
is
considered
noise
for
which
the
accepted
value
is
stated
in
subparagraph
4.2.2.3.
Both
the
near
end
and
far
end
intelligible
crosstalk
shall
each
be
at
least
55
dB
below
signal
level
in
the
frequency
band
transmitted
.
4.2.2.8
Echo
.
In
a
telephone
connection
,
user-to
-user,
which
is
completely
4-wire,
including
the
telephone
sets
but
excluding
any
side
-tone
circuits
,
electrical
echo
need
not
be
considered
.
However
,
if
there
are
2-wire
sections
or
elements
at
either
or
both
ends
of
the
connection
,
echo
will
exist
.
This
is
due
to
lack
of
perfect
electrical
balance
between
the
impedances
of
the
"
line"
and
"balancing
network"
circuits
associated
with
the
hybrid
circuits
at

General
Digital

The

deal
with
standards
and
design
objectives
for
single
channel
and
multichannel
circuits
which
provide
for
transmission
of
binary
dc
signals
between
end
instruments
.
These
standards
and
design
objectives
are
expressed
in
the
form
of
technical
21
MIL-STD-
188-100
15
November
1972
parameters
,
which
shall
be
achieved
on
all
common
long
haul/tactical
data
grade
circuits
regardless
of
user-to
-user
distances
of
up
to
approximately
22,
000
km
(12
,
000
nmi)
,
transmission
media
,
and
multiplexing
scheme
used
(FDM,
TDM,
or
a
mix
of
FDM
and
TDM
)
.
Part
of
these
parameters
are
stated
as
design
objectives
rather
than
as
standards
due
to
a
lack
of
measured
and
verified
data
available
at
the
present
time
or
due
to
a
lack
of
general
consensus
in
the
interpretation
of
the
data
.
Data
transmission
is
usually
accomplished
by
converting
the
binary
dc
signal
into
a
quasianalog
form
for
transmission
over
channels
which
are
not
capable
of
transmitting
signals
in
de
digital
form
.
Characteristics
of
a
number
of
conversion
devices
(modems)
are
standardized
in
order
to
accommodate
the
variety
of
data
to
be
transmitted
over
the
different
types
of
transmission
media
available
.
The
quasi
-analog
signal
does
not
have
to
be
in
binary
form
since
multi-level
(m
-ary)
modulation
schemes
also
are
being
utilized
for
converting
the
binary
dc
signal
into
a
quasi
-analog
form
.
For
wire
and
cable
transmission
media,
signals
may
be
transmitted
in
de
digital
form
without
conversion
to
quasianalog
form
over
relatively
short
distances
.
The
data
signaling
rate
shall
be
expressed
in
bits
per
second
(b/s)
;
the
modulation
rate
shall
be
expressed
in
Baud
(Bd
)
.
Data
signaling
rates
in
b/s
and
modulation
rates
in
Bd
are
the
same
if,
and
only
if,
all
pulses
are
the
same
length,
all
pulses
occupy
the
complete
unit
interval
,
and
binary
(rather
than
m-ary)
signaling
is
used
.
(a)
Binary
Synchronous
Serial
Systems
.
In
such
systems
,
the
signal
at
the
standard
digital
interface
is
serial
and
isochronous
,
i.e.
,
it
is
a
two-state
signal
,
with
all
signal
elements
nominally
equal
to
the
unit
interval
,
or
multiple
thereof.
In
this
case
the
modulation
rate
in
Bd
and
the
information
rate
in
b/s
are
numerically
equal
and
either
term
is
correct
for
a
binary
isochronous
signal
.
(b)
Quasi
-Analog
Signals
.
A
modem
generates
quasi
-analog
signals
suitable
for
the
analog
circuit
.
If
the
quasi
-analog
signals
are
binary
in
a
synchronous
system,
the
nominal
time
structure
of
the
dc
digital
signal
is
not
affected
by
the
modem,
and
the
rate
of
the
quasi
-analog
signal
may
be
expressed
in
either
Bd
or
b/s
.
But,
in
more
sophisticated
systems
,
this
is
generally
not
true
.
For
instance,
a
4
-phase
modem
handling
2400
b/s
at
the
standard
digital
interface
emits
a
line
signal
modulated
at
1200
Bd.
The
modulation
rate
in
Bds
should
be
used
at
the
quasi
-
analog
side
of
the
modem
and
at
the
transmission
equipment
as
a
more
meaningful
term
.
Parenthetical
additions
should
be
used
with
the
modulation
rate
where
this
will
help
clarify
the
text,
e.g.
,
2400
Bds
(binary)
,
1200
Bds
(4
level)
.
(c)
Start-
Stop
Systems
.
In
start-
stop
operation,
the
stop
element
may
not
be
a
multiple
of
the
unit
interval
(as
in
7.42
unit-per-character
interval)
.
Also
,
the
interval
between
characters
in
direct
keyboard
operation
is
not
necessarily
a
multiple
of
the
unit
interval
.
To
express
the
"
instantaneous
"
modulation
rate
at
which
signal
elements
are
transmitted
during
a
character
interval
(and
the
required
bandwidth
is
proportional
to
this)
,
it
is
necessary
to
use
the
unit
Bd
.
In
general
,
the
modulation
rate
in
Bd
is
greater
than
the
information
rate
in
b/s
,
e.g.
,
ASCII
(seven
information
bits
plus
one
parity
bit
plus
one
start
bit
and
one
stop
bit
per
character
interval
)
requires
a
modulation
rate
of
100
Bds
to
transmit
80
b/s
information
.
NOTE:
In
this
example
the
parity
bit
has
been
included
as
user
information.

4.3.1.3
Low
Level
Digital
Interfaces
.
4.3.1.3.21
General
.
The
low
level
digital
interface
has
two
basic
configurations
,
one
unbalanced
and
the
other
balanced
.
Both
are
required
.
The
balanced
digital
interface
allows
for
longer
cable
transmission
distances
than
the
unbalanced
interface
.
The
balanced
interface
also
reduces
interference
from
ground
potential
differences
between
source
(driver)
and
sink
(terminator)
.
The
use
of
a
balanced
cable
produces
a
lower
level
of
"
near
end"
crosstalk
in
the
metallic
cable
plant
without
a
requirement
for
significant
shaping
at
the
source
.
In
the
past,
use
of
low-level
balanced
dc
transmission
was
not
popular
due
primarily
to
the
unavailability
of
low-cost
solid-state
devices
for
converting
unbalanced
dc
signals
to
balanced
de
signals
.
With
the
increased
availability
of
these
devices
it
is
likely
that
the
balanced
de
interface
will
experience
greater
usage
.
The
most
likely
immediate
widespread
application
of
balanced
interconnections
is
between
the
main
or
intermediate
distribution
frame
and
the
cable
pairs
to
the
distant
frame
.
In
general,
however,
the
unbalanced
interface
will
still
result
in
lower
system
cost
since
two
filters
,
two
wires
,
two
jack
springs
,
two
cross
connects
,
etc.
,
are
required
for
the
balanced
interconnections
whereas
unbalanced
interconnections
require
only
one
of
these
(see
respective
paragraph
of
MIL-STD-188-300)
.
Technology
in
1972
permits
the
manufacture
of
integrated
circuits
which
will
switch
up
to
approximately
10
megabaud.
Under
conditions
where
the
length
of
the
transmission
line
approaches
zero
,
both
the
balanced
and
unbalanced
interface
will,
therefore,
function
up
to
about
10
megabaud.
4.3.1.3.2
Applicability.
The
following
characteristics
shall
be
applicable
to
signal
,
clock,
and
control
circuits
for
all
digital
de
communications
where
a
binary
interface
appears
.
The
interface
standard
applies
to
teletypewriters
,
data
terminals
,
the
dc
side
of
signal
conversion
(modem)
equipment,
both
terminal
and
line
side
of
cryptographic
or
cryptographic
control
equipment,
and
remotely
operated
equipment
where
the
interface
is
at
the
dc
baseband
(see
Figure
4.3-2)
.
These
standard
interfaces
are
applicable
at
all
data
rates
regardless
of
the
type
of
transmission
medium
used,
e.g.
,
a
nominal
4-kHz
channel
,
a
nominal
48
-kHz
channel
,
or
a
metallic
wire
or
coaxial
cable
circuit.
These
interface
standards
are
design
objectives
for
alarm
and
control
circuits
which
are
not
directly
related
to
the
data
or
timing.

the
standard
.
The
choice
of
the
standard
interface,
either
balanced

,
is
left
to
the
designer
and
depends
upon
the
data

and
other
factors
.
For
certain

have
been
standardized
by
the
American
National
Standards
Institute
.
The
first
is
NRZI
Recording
(see
Note
2)
standardized
for
recording
densities
up
to
800
CPI
(Character

Inch)
.
The
second
is
Phase
Encoded
recording
(
see
Notes
3
,
4,
and
5
)
used
at
1600
CPI
.
NOTE
2:
NRZI
=
Non

and
make
no
change
in
polarity
for
"
0"
data
bits
.
NOTE
3:
In
Phase
Encoded
recording
a
"
1
"
data
bit
is
a
flux
reversal
to
the
polarity
of
the
interblock
gap,
when
reading
in
the
forward
direction
(see
Note
5)
.
NOTE
4:
In
Phase
Encoded
recording
a
"
0"
data
bit
is
a
flux
reversal
to
the
polarity
opposite
to
that
of
the
interblock
gap
,
when
reading
in
the
forward
direction
(see
Note

shall
be
written
at
the
nominal
midpoint
between
successive
"
1

bits
or
between
successive
"
0"
bits
to
establish
proper

shall
be
called
a

An
alternative
capability
to
interface
with
equipment
conforming
to
other
standards
,
e.g.
,
industrial
and
CCITT,
standards
,
shall
be
provided
to
accept
signals
which
may
have
polarities
opposite
to
those
stated
in
this

.
4.3.1.6
Clock
Equipment,
Control
,
and
Timing
.
The
clock
is
the
device
which
provides
the
time
base
for
controlling
operation
of
digital
equipment
.
An
equipment
clock
provides
the
peculiar
needs
of
its
equipment
and
in
some
cases
may
control
the
flow
of
data
at
its
equipment
interface
.
A
master
or
station
clock,
regardless
of
its
physical
location
,
controls
two
or
more
equipments
which
are
linked
together
as
a
system
.
The
following
subparagraphs
,
4.3.1.6.1
through
4.3.1.6.3.1,
are
primarily
concerned
with
master
or
station
clocks
.
4.3.1.6.1
Transmission
Modes
.
All
future
communication
equipment
requiring
a
stable
clock
or
precise
character
interval
control
shall
make
provisions
for
operating
from
station
clocks
in
any
or
all
of
the
following
modes
,
specified
in
subparagraphs
4.3.1.6.1.1
through
4.3.1.6.1.3
.
Bit
Synchronous
.
In
bit
synchronous
operation,
clock
timing
shall
be
4.3.1.6.1.1
delivered
at
twice
the
data
modulation
rate
.
(For
this
purpose
"

includes
infor
–
mation
bits
plus
all
bits
added
to
the
stream

whatever
purpose
they

)
.
The
device
shall
release
one
bit
within
the
duration
of
one
clock
cycle
.
It
shall
be
assumed
that
,
during
periods
of
communication
difficulty,
a
clock
signal
might
be
delivered
to
a
send
device
occasionally
or
not
at
all
for
periods
extending
to
hours
.
During
periods
when
the
sending
equipment
has
no
traffic
to
send,
an
idle
pattern
or
all
"
ones"
may
be
transmitted
.
4.33.1.6.1
.
.2
Bit-By-Bit
Asynchronous
.
In
bit-by-bit
asynchronous
operation
it
is
assumed
that
rapid
manual,
semiautomatic
or
automatic
shifts
in
the
data
modulation
rate
will
be
accomplished
by
gating
or
slewing
the
clock
modulation
rate
.
It
is
possible
that
equipment
may
be
operated
at
50
b/s
one
moment
and
the
next
moment
at
1200
b/s
or
2400b/s
,
etc.
It
shall
be
assumed
that
,
during
periods
of
communication
difficulty,
a
clock
signal
might
be
delivered
to
a
send
device
occasionally
or
not
at
all
for
periods
extending
to
hours
.
During
periods
when
the
sending
equipment
has
no
traffic
to
send,
an
idle
pattern
or
all
"
ones
"
may
be
transmitted
.
4.3.1.6.1.3
Character
Interval
Synchronous
.
In
character
interval
synchronized
equipment,
any
character
interval
from
4
to
16
unit
intervals
per
character
interval
shall
be
permitted
.
It
is
assumed
that,
having
programmed
a
given
facility
for
a
particular
character
interval
,
no
other
character
interval
operation
would
be
expected
except
by
reprogramming
.
An
example
of
such
operation
would
be
a
7.0

character
interval
tape
reader
being
stepped
at
8.0
units

4.3.1.6.2.1
Modulation
Rates
.
The
standard
clock
modulation
rates
for
compatibility
with
modulation
or
data
signaling
rates
shall
be
two
times
the
standard
rates
specified
in
subparagraph
4.
3.1.1.
4.3.1.6.2.2
Modulation
Rate
Stability
.
The
stability
of
synchronizing
or
clock
timing
supplied
in
all
synchronous
digital
transmission,
switching,
terminal
,
and
security
equipment
shall
be
sufficient
to
ensure
that
synchronism
is
maintained
within
±25
percent
of
the
unit
interval
between
transmitted
and
received
signals
for
periods
of
not
less
than
100,000
consecutive
seconds
.
4.3.1.6.2.3
Modulation
Rate
Phase
Adjustment
.
Means
shall
be
provided
in
all
digital
transmission,
switching,
terminal
,
and
security
equipment
so
that,
at
the
applicable
modulation
rate,
a
shift
in
phase
of
the
incoming
data
stream
with
relation
to
the
clocking
pulse
shall
be
possible
over
a
period
of
three
unit
intervals
(
i.e.
,
a
shift
of
1.5
unit
intervals
early
or
late
from
theoretical
center
of
the
unit
interval
at
the
applicable
modulation
rate)
.
4.3.1.6.2.4
Output
Signal
.
The
output
of
the
clock
shall
be
an
alternating
symmetrically-shaped
wave
at
the
required
clock
modulation
rate
.
In
the
case
of
an
unbalanced
digital
interface
,
the
clock
output
signal
shall
comply
with
the
voltage
and
wave
shaping
requirement
of
subparagraphs
4.3.1.3.3.4
and
4.3.1.3.3.5,
respectively
.
In
the
case
of
a
balanced
digital
interface
,
the
clock
output
signal
shall
comply
with
the
voltage
requirements
of
subparagraph
4.3.1
.

and
shall
contain
no
points
of

prior
to
reaching

.
When
the

is
quiescent,
the
clock
signal
state
shall
be

4.3.1.6.2.5
Clock
Period
.
A
clock
period
or
cycle
is
defined
as
having
one
halfcycle
of
positive
polarity
(sense)
and
one
half-cycle
of
negative
polarity
(
sense)
.
The
duty
cycle
shall
be
50
percent
±1.0
percent
.
Thus,
in
the
binary
sense,
each
clock
period
or
cycle
is
composed
of
two
clock
unit
intervals
,
and
it
follows
that
a
clock
rate
of
50
Hz
is
a
clock
modulation
rate
of
100
Bds
.
4.3.1.6.3
Clock/Data
Phase
Relationship
.
Arrangements
which
may
be
used
to
supply
clock
pulses
to
sources
and
sinks
are
shown
in
subparagraph
4
,
3.1.6.3.1
.
Typical
standard
arrangements
are
shown
from
which
one
may
be
selected
to
meet
a
specific
application
.
For
those
digital
devices
operated
at
dc
baseband
which
are
interconnected
by
metallic
wire
(or
other
equipment
which
provides
in
effect
the
same
function
as
a
metallic
wire)
the
following
clock/data
phase
relationships
apply
if,
and
only
if,
interface
circuit
lengths
permit
.
It
is
noted
that,
due
to
signal
propagation
delay
time
differences
over
different
de
wire
circuits
or
dc
equivalent
circuits
at
data
modulation
rates
higher
than
2400
Bd,
there
may
be
a
significant
relative
clock/data
phase
shift
which
must
be
adjusted
in
accordance
with
subparagraph
4
,
3
,
1.6.2.3
.
Practical
operating
experience
indicates
that
typical
multiple
pair
paper
cable
or
polyvinyl
chloride
(PVC)
insulated
exchange
grade
telephone
cable
may
be
expected
to
function
at
modulation
rates
of
4800
Bd
data/
9600
Bd
clock
at
distances
up
to
3000
cable
feet
without
any
need
for
concern
over
relative
phase
shift
or
noise
if
the
standard
low
level
digital
interface
is
applied
to
both
clock
and
data
signals
in
accordance
with
subparagraph
4.3.1.3.
All
data
transitions
emitted
by
a
source
under
direct
control
of
an
external
clock
shall
occur
on
(be
caused
by)
negative
to
positive
transitions
of
that
clock
.
The
design
objective
is
a
minimum
delay
between
the
clock
transition
and
the
resulting
data
transition,
but
in
no
case
shall
this
delay
exceed
12.5
percent
of
the
duration
of
the
data
unit
interval
.
For
each
equipment,
once
this
delay
is
fixed
in
hardware,
it
shall
be
consistent
within
+1
percent
of
itself
for
each
clock
transition
.
These
delay
limits
shall
apply
directly
at
the
driver
interface
(see
Figure
4.3-6
)
.
Sampling
of
the
data
signal
by
the
external
clock
at
a
sink
interface
shall
occur
on
(be
caused
by)
positive
to
negative
clock
transitions
(see
Figure
4.3-7)
.
When
the
clock
is
used
for
controlling
intermittent
data
transmission,
data
may
not
change
state
except
when
requested
by
a
negative
to
positive
clock
transition
.
The
quiescent
state
of
the
clock
shall
be
at
negative
voltage
.
The
quiescent
state
of
the
data
shall
be
that
state
resulting
from
the
last
negative
to
positive
clock
transition
(see
Figure
4.3-8)
.
The
phase
relationship
between
external
clock
and
data
is
not
specified
for
devices
in
which
the
external
clock
is
related
only
indirectly
to
the
source
data;
for
example,
to
maintain
synchronism
between
a
data
source
and
a
data
sink
for
a
signal
with
a
constant
modulation
rate
.
However,
whatever
the
phase
delay,
it
shall
be
consistent
to
within
+1
percent
of
the
data
unit
interval
at
the
applicable
modulation
rate
.
If
the
clock
at
twice
the
modulation
rate
of
the
same
data
is
also
supplied
as
an
output,
then
data
transitions
shall
coincide
within
±1
percent
of
the
data
unit
interval
with
the
negative
to
positive
transitions
of
the
output
clock
(see
Figure
4.3-9)
.
Direct
control
means
control
of
the
data
by
a
clock
signal
at
twice
the
modulation
rate
of
the
data
.
Indirect
control
means
use
of
a
clock
at
some
higher
standard
modulation
rate
,
e.g.
,
4,
8
,
128
times
the
modulation
rate
.

General
.
The

establish
standards
and
design
objectives
for
unconditioned
voice
bandwidth
circuits
which
are
used
for
transmission
of
digital
information
in
quasi-analog
form.
These
standards
and
design
objectives
are
applicable
to
circuits
connecting
data
reference
terminals
for
transmission
of
digital
information
with
data
signaling
rates
of
up
to
1200
b/s
.
These
4.3.2.1
unconditioned
circuits
may
also
be
used
for
satisfactory
voice
and
facsimile
service
.
Such
circuits
are
provided
by
the
use
of
controlled
loop
characteristics
and
by
the
use
of
TDM
derived
channels
and
of
those
FDM
derived
channels
which
are
best
suited
for
quasi-analog
data
service

.
In

,
experience
has
shown
that

,
such
as
phase
and
amplitude
hits
,
impulse
noise,
and
dropouts
as
well
as
the
envelope

distortion
and
the
insertion
loss
versus

characteristic
are
major
causes
of
unsatisfactory
data
transmission
in
the
form
of
excessive
digital
error
rates
.
If
the
circuit
parameters
described
herein
are
achieved
,
experience
has
shown
that
the
design
objective
for
the
digital
error
rate
stated
in
subparagraph

should
also
be
achievable
.
As
general
guidance
for
long

applications
,
the
data
circuit
should
be
equipped
with
a
regeneration
capability
if
the
parameters
listed
in
subparagraphs
4.3.2.2
through
4.3.2.12
cannot
be
achieved
.
Regeneration
is
generally
not
employed
on
tactical
data
circuits
;
however,
when
tactical
data
circuits
are
interconnected
with
long
haul
data
circuits
,
regeneration
may
be
necessary
at
the
interface
point
.
In
any
case,
regeneration
points
have
to
be
determined
on
an
individual
basis
.

General
.
The
following
subparagraphs
4.3.3.2
through
4.3.3.12
establish
standards
and
design
objectives
for
conditioned
voice
bandwidth
circuits
(also
called
data
grade
circuits
)
which
are
used
for
transmission
of
digital
information
in
quasianalog
form
.
These
standards
and
design
objectives
are
applicable
to
circuits
connecting
data
reference
terminals
for
transmission
ofdigital
information
with
modulation
rates
of
1200
Bds
or
2400
Bds
,
depending
on
the
modulation
technique
used
.
Multilevel
or
"
m-ary"
modulators
emit
a
line
signal
in
which
each
quasi
-analog
signal
element
carries
information
of
two
or
more
bits
of
the
dc
data
signal
.
Special
conditioning
devices
(which
provide
equalization
for
the
envelope
delay
distortion
and
the
insertion
loss
versus
frequency
characteristic
of
a
voice
bandwidth
channel)
will
be
required
for
higher
signaling
rates
,
such
as
4800
b/s
or
9600
b/s
.
Standards
for
these
special
conditioning
devices
are
not
included
in
this
document.
Development
work
continues
with
the
objective
of
increasing
the
data
signaling
rate
achievable
over
voice
bandwidth
circuits
.
Conditioned
voice
bandwidth
circuits
are
provided
by
the
use
of
controlled
and
conditioned
loop
characteristics
and
by
the
use
of
TDM
derived
channels
and
of
those
FDM
derived
channels
which
are
best
suited
for
quasi
-analog
data
service
.

In
general
,
experience
has
shown
that
signal
discontinuities
,
such
as
phase
and
amplitude
hits
,
impulse
noise
,
and
dropouts
as
well
as
the
envelope
delay
distortion
and
the
insertion
loss
versus
frequency
characteristic
are
major
causes
of
unsatisfactory
data
transmission
in
the
form
of
excessive
digital
error
rates
.
If
the
circuit
parameters
described
herein
are
achieved,
48

experience
has
shown
that
the
design
objective
for
the
digital
error
rate
stated
in
subparagraph
4.3.1.8
should
also
be
achievable
.
As
general
guidance
for
long

applications
,
the

should
be
equipped

a

capability
if
the
parameters

4.3.3.2
through
4.3.3.12
cannot
be
achieved
.
Regeneration
is
generally
not
employed
on
tactical
data
circuits
;
however,
when
tactical
data
circuits
are
interconnected
with
long
haul
data
circuits
,
regeneration
may
be
necessary
at
the
interface
point
.
In
any
case,
regeneration
points
have
to
be
determined

Transmission
Circuits
.
4.4.1
General
.
The
transmission
circuit
is
the
complete
electrical
path
between
the
user's
end-terminal
instruments
(may
be
either
analog
or
digital
)
over
which
two-way
telecommunications
are
provided
.
The
transmission
circuit
will
consist
of
loops
and
of
a
channel
(see
Figure
4.4-1
)
.
Paragraph
4.4
is
divided
into
two
parts
.
The
first
part,
subparagraph
4.4.2,
deals
with
the
characteristics
of
the
loops
(local
line
or
user's
line)
which
connects
a
user's
end
instrument
and
a
trunk
or
individual
message
distribution
point,
or
a
switching
center,
or
a
central
office,
or
a
node
.
The
second
part,
subparagraph
4.4.3,
deals
with
the
overall
characteristics
of
the
channel
which
interconnects
the
two
user
loops
.
In
general,
a
channel
will
consist
of
a
series
of
links
connected
in
tandem
.
The
links
may
be
either
FDM
modulation
links
(see
subparagraph
4.5.2)
or
TDM/PCM
voice
bandwidth
links
(see
subparagraph
4.5.3)
.
A
channel
may
also
consist
of
a
mix
of
FDM
voice
bandwidth
links
and
TDM/
PCM
voice
bandwidth
links
in
tandem
.

Characteristics
.
The
loops
may
be
identified
as
either
an
analog
loop
or
a
digital
loop
.
The
analog
loops
are
used
for
analog
end
instruments
(see
paragraph
5.7)
and
for
digital
end
instruments
when
the
digital
data
modems
are
located
at
the
user's
terminals
(see
paragraph
5.4)
.
The
digital
loops
are
used
for
digital
end
instruments
(see
paragraph
5.8)
when
the
transmission
circuit
is
all
digital
or
the
digital
data
modems
are
located
at
the
(digital)
loop/(analog)
channel
interface
.

4.4.2.1
Parameters
of
Single
Loop
for
Analog
Service
(Voice
or
Facsimile)
.
The
characteristics
of
analog
loops
will
vary
widely
among
tactical
highly
maneuverable
users
,
tactical
less
maneuverable
users
,
and
long
haul
users
.
In
addition
to
the
different
types
of
loops
,
the
actual
loops
may
range
from
very
short
loops
,
consisting
entirely
of
local
plant
facilities
,
loaded
or
nonloaded
cable
pairs
,
to
very
long
loops
,
consisting
of
one
or
more
facilities
of
a
long
haul
plant,
such
as
loaded
toll
grade
cable
or
carrier
plus
an
end
section
consisting
of
local
plant
facilities
.
As
may
be
expected
,
the
characteristics
of
the
loops
will
vary
widely
and
are
predictable
only
when
the
specific
makeup
of
a
loop
is
known.
Each
loop
is
a
separate
problem
and
each
loop
must
be
individually
engineered
to
ensure
adequate
user-to
-user
communication
service
.
Each
loop
will
act
as
a
frequency
filter-attenuator
and
will
degrade
the
circuit
characteristics
(see
Figure
4.4-2
)
.

4.4.2.1.1.1
Long
Haul
Loop
.
The
insertion
loss
of
long
haul
loops
is
controlled
at
the
Technical
Control
Facility
(TCF)
and
each
loop
is
adjusted
on
an
individual
basis
.
The
insertion
loss
of
a
four-wire
loop
shall
be
6
dB
measured
at
1000
Hz
±25
Hz
.
The
insertion
loss
of
a
two-wire
loop
shall
be
adjusted
for
an
average
loss
of
3
dB,
measured
at
1000
Hz
±25
Hz
,
with
a
maximum
loss
of
7
dB,
depending
on
trunk
arrangement
and
loop
configuration
.
When
a
two-wire
loop
is
connected
to
a
four
-wire
PBX,
an
additional
4
dB
of
loss
is
allowed
for
a
two
-wire/four
-wire
hybrid
transformer
resulting
in
an
overall
maximum
loop
loss
of
11
dB.

Tactical
Highly

Loop
.
The
insertion
loss
of
tactical
highly
maneuverable
loops
is
not
controlled
and
no
adjustments
are
made
for
loop
insertion
loss
.
A
statistical
distribution
of
the
loop
insertion
loss
is
assumed
for
the
purpose
of
system
engineering
and
circuit
design
.
The
loss
of
one
loop
(two
-wire
or
four-wire)
measured
at
1000
Hz
±25
Hz
is
assumed
to
be
exponential
distributed
with
a
mean
loss
per

and
with
a

(sigma)
of

The
specifications
for
loop
insertion
loss
are
not
stated
in
statistical
form;
rather,
recommended
minimum
and
maximum
values
are
given.
The
recommended
loop
loss
measured
at

±25
Hz
for
one
fourwire
loop
is
between
6
dB
and

with
a

dB
.
For
one

loop
the
recommended
loop
loss
measured
at
1000
Hz
±25
Hz
is
between
6
dB
and
12

with
a
mean
loop
loss
of
9

These
losses
include
the
two-wire/four

hybrid
transformer
insertion

and
the
two-wire

,
if
applicable
.
Since
it
is
not

,

shall
be

(see
subparagraphs

Noise
of

.
The
noise

a
single
long

or
tactical
less
maneuverable
loop
(two
-wire
or
four
-wire)
to
the

noise
is
assumed
to
be
6250
pWp0
(approximately
38
dBrnc0)
referenced
to
the
long
haul
OTLP
.
Noise
on
field
wire
and
cable
loops
in
the
tactical
highly
maneuverable
system
is
usually
so
much
lower
than
noise
on
trunks
that
its
effect
on
a
user-to
-user
circuit
may
be
neglected
.
Trouble
conditions
may,
however,
produce
excessive
noise
which
should
be
cleared
for
satisfactory
operation
.
4.4.2.1.5
Impedance
.
The
impedance
of
wire
and
cable
loops
varies
widely
with
frequency,
temperature,
moisture,
and
length
and
is
not
specified
as
a
standard
.
However,
the
nominal
value
of
the
impedance
is
assumed
to
be
between
600
ohms
and
900
ohms,
balanced
to

4.4.3.1.1
General
.
A
long

will
consist
of
several
links

,
the
smaller

parameters
.
The
following
subparagraphs
4.4.3.1.2
through
4.4.3.1.12
deal
with
standards
and
design
objectives
of
a
nominal
3-kHz
channel
between
originating
node
and
terminating
node
of
a
long
haul/tactical
circuit.
These
channels
do
not
include
the
loops
to
and
from
the
user.
The
standards
and
design
objectives
are
expressed
in
the
form
of
technical
parameters
,
such
as
received
noise
power
or
transmitted
bandwidth,
which
shall
be
achieved
on
all
long

voice
circuits
regardless
of
channel
distances

,
transmission
media,
and
multiplexing
scheme
used
(FDM,

and

.
Part
of
these
parameters
are
stated
as
design
objectives
rather
than
as
standards
,
due
to
a
lack
of
measured
and
verified
data
available
at
the
present

or
due
to
a
lack
of
general
consensus
in
the
interpretation
of

General
.
A
long
haul/tactical
channel
will
consist
of
several
links
in
tandem
.
The
characteristics
of
a
channel
will
be
determined
by
the
summation
methods
of
the
transfer
characteristics
of
the
individual
links
in
tandem
(see
paragraphs
4.5
and
4.6)
.
The
following
subparagraphs
4.4.3.2.2
through
4.4.3.2.12
deal
with
standards
and
design
objectives
of
a
nominal
4-kHz
channel
between
originating
node
and
terminating
node
of
a
long
haul/tactical
circuit
.
These
channels
do
not
include
the
loops
to
and
from
the
user
.
The
standards
and
design
objectives
are
expressed
in
the
form
of
technical
parameters
,
such
as
received
noise
power
or
transmitted
bandwidth,
which
shall
be
achieved
on
all
long
haul/tactical
voice
circuits
regardless
of
channel
distances
of
up
to
approximately
22,000
km
(12,000
nmi
)
,
transmission
media,
and
multiplexing
scheme
used
(FDM,
TDM,
or
a
mix
of
FDM
and
TDM)
.
Part
of
these
parameters
are
stated
as
design
objectives
rather
than
as
standards
,
due
to
a
lack
of
measured
and
verified
data
available
at
the
present
time
or
due
to
a
lack
of
general
consensus

the
interpretation
of
the

4.4.3.2.2.3
Standard
Test
Signal
.
(See
Table
4.4-1
.
)
The
standard
test
signal
is
generally
used
for
testing
the
peak
power
transmission
capability
and
for
measuring
the
total
harmonic
distortion
of
a
channel
.
In
the
tactical
highly
maneuverable
system,
the
standard
test
signal
is
also
used
for
level
alignment
of
links
in
tandem
providing
that
the
circuit
to
be
aligned
does
not
include
links
of
the
long
haul
or
the
tactical
less
maneuverable
system
.
The
standard
test
signal
should
not
be
used
in
the
long
haul
or
the
tactical
less
maneuverable
system
for
level
alignment
of
links
in
tandem
since
the
test

(see
subparagraph

.
In
addition,
the
standard
test
tone
shall
be
used
for
level

of
tactical
highly

links
if
these
links
interface
and
form
a

.
Details
of
this
level

are
provided
in
subparagraph
4.7.9.1
.
In
the
long

and
in
the
tactical

systems
the
standard

shall
be
-10

NOTE:
The
difference
in
test
tone
levels
between
the
tactical
highly
maneuverable
system
and
the
long
haul
or
the
tactical
less

is
caused
by
different
traffic
signal
levels
(voice
and
data)
at
the
respective
OTLP
of
the
system
under
consideration
.
The
different
traffic
signal
levels
are
based
on
different
overload
characteristics
of
the
communication
equipment
employed
in
these
systems
.
THEREFORE
,
ANY
TLP
OF
A
TACTICAL
HIGHLY
MANEUVERABLE
SYSTEM
HAS
TO
BE
CONSIDERED
INTERNAL
TO
THIS
SYSTEM
AND
MUST
NOT
BE
RELATED
TO
A
TLP
OF
EITHER
A
LONG
HAUL
OR
A
TACTICAL

SYSTEM
IN
TERMS
OF
SIGNAL
LEVELS
.
For
interfacing
a

or
a
tactical

maneuverable
circuit
see
subparagraph
4.7.9.1
.
4.4.3.2.2.5
Monitoring
Test
Tone
.
(See
Table
4.4-1
.
)
The
monitoring
test
tone
is
used
for
testing
channels
of
the
long
haul
and
the
tactical
less
maneuverable
systems
when
the
test
period
exceeds
approximately
4
hours
,
e.g.
,
during
net
loss
variation
measurements
.
The
monitoring
test
tone
is
used
because
it
is
comparable
to
the
long
term
loading
of
the
FDM
and
radio
equipment
(see
subparagraph
4.
5.
2.
1
)
.
The
monitoring
test
tone
is
not
required
in
the
tactical
highly
maneuverable
system
since
the
overload
characteristic
of
the
communication
equipment
employed
in
this
system
allows
monitoring
with
the
test
signal
of
0
dBm0
or
with
the
test
tone
of
-3
dBm0
(
see
Table
4.4-1
)
stated
in

respectively
.
The
monitoring
test
tone
shall
be
-15

with
a
frequency
of
1000
Hz
±25
Hz
for
use
in
the
long
haul
and
tactical
less
maneuverable
systems
.
NOTE:
If
the
monitoring
test
tone
is
transmitted
across
a
long
haul/tactical
highly
maneuverable
interface
,
it
will
appear
at
a
level
of
−12
dBm
at
the
-4

of
the
tactical

1
General
.
This
paragraph
establishes
standards
and
design
objectives
for
analog
group
bandwidth
channels
which
are
used
for
the
transmission
of
high
speed
digital
data
signals
.
Such
channels
are
provided
over
those
FDM
groups
which
are
best
suited
for
high
speed
digital
service
.
GROUP
A
(12
kHz
to
60
kHz)
,
GROUP
1
OF
SUPERGROUP
1
,
AND
GROUP
5
OF
SUPERGROUP
3
ARE
NOT
RECOMMENDED
FOR
THIS
PURPOSE
.
The
group
channel
normally
terminates
at
each
end
of
the
group
distribution
frame
(GDF)
or
equivalent
points
.
Its
nominal
bandwidth
extends
from
60
kHz
to
108
kHz;
however,
the
standard
group
pilot
for
system
regulation
and
alarm
appears
at
104,08
kHz
,
which
effectively
prevents
the
use
of
the
104-kHz
to
108
-kHz
portion
of
this
bandwidth
for
high
speed
data
.
This
portion
can
be
used
for
a
voice
or
medium
speed
data
circuit
for
coordination
and
control
of
the
high
speed
data
channel
.
The
remaining
bandwidth
is
suitable
for
high
speed
data
transmission
.
In
systems
having
pilots
at
frequencies
other
than
104.08
kHz
,
such
pilots
must
be
disabled
and
the
filters
associated
with
them
removed
from
the
group
channel
before
this
channel
may
be
used
for
high
speed
data.
Loop
characteristics
are
not
included
herein
but
must
be
carefully
considered
and
engineered
for
user-to
-user
service
.

General
.
(Under
consideration
.
)
The
reference
modulation
links
discussed
herein
deal
with
"building
block"
configurations
of
transmission
and
modulation
.
Historically
,
these
configurations
were
developed
for
analog
speech
service
and
as
such
they
did
not
deal
with
technical
control
configurations
,
nor
with
switched
subsystems
or
networks
.
However,
with
the
advent
of
quasi
-analog
data
service
and
AUTOVON
and
AUTODIN
switched
network
applications
,
additional
conditioning
and
regeneration
equipment
must
be
introduced
to
the
basic
configurations
to
ensure
satisfactory
performance
.
Hypothetical
configurations
for
voice
,
data
,
AUTOVON
and
AUTODIN
service
are
included
in
this
document
.
Additional
detailed

about
these
and
other
possible

In

some
of
the
considerations
from
the
documents

will
be

to
illustrate
where
the

fit

.
4.5.2
Characteristics
of
Single
FDM
Reference
Modulation
Links
.
The
configuration
of
a
common
long
haul/tactical
less
maneuverable
FDM
reference
modulation
link
is
shown
in
Figure
4.5-1
.
This
link,
called
a
Type
I
link,
has
no
multiplex
translations
between
the
initiating
and
the
terminating
HFDFs
and
the
transmission
medium
may
consist
of
LOS
radio
relay,
troposcatter
satellite
relay,
or
submarine
cable
and
each
medium
may
cover
different
nominal
distances
.
In
the
long
haul
system
,
the
Type
I
link
is
either
a
nominal
617
km
(333
nmi
)
radio
or
cable
link
or
a
nominal
5556
km
(3000
nmi)
submarine
cable
or
satellite
relay
link
.
In
the
tactical
less
maneuverable
system
,
the
Type
I
FDM
reference
modulation
link
can
be
assumed
to
comprise
six
LOS
radio
repeater
links
of
average
length
of
about
51
km
(28
nmi
)
,
properly
sited
,
resulting
in
a
nominal
length
of
308
km
(167
nmi
)
of
the
reference
modulation
link.
Regardless
of
the
nominal
distance
,
Figure
4.5-1
shows
the
basic
configuration
of
a
Type
I
link
.
The
FDM
reference
voice
bandwidth
link
begins
at
the
left
of
Figure
4.5-1
at
audio
frequency
(A)
,
is
modulated
in
successive
stages
to
basic
group
frequency
band
(G)
and
basic
supergroup
frequency
band
(S)
and
then,
as
required
,
to
either
baseband
frequency
(B)
for
radio
transmission
or
to
line
frequency
band
(
L)
for
metallic
line
transmission
,
over
the
appropriate
medium
.
At
the
receiving
end
of
the
link,
corresponding
demodulation
stages
return
to
audio
frequency
(A)
.
The
FDM
reference
group
bandwidth
line
(Type
I)
begins
at
the
left
of
Figure
4.5-1
at
group
frequency
band
(G)
,
is
modulated
and
demodulated
in
a
similar
manner
,
and
terminates
at
(G)
on
the
right
.
Figure
4.5-1
shows
only
one
direction
of
transmission
;
the
other
direction
is
identical
.
Special
requirements
for
the
tactical
highly
maneuverable
system
have
led
to
the
development
of
FDM
equipment
with
channel
groupings
different
from
the
configuration
shown

are
given
in
the
following
subparagraphs
4.5.2.1
through

.
Some
of
the
values
appearing
in
these
subparagraphs
are
based
on
recent
multiplex
tests
and
are
different
from
the
values
appearing
in
MIL
-STD188-300
which
will
be
revised
accordingly.
4.5.2.1
Loading.
4.5.2.1.1
Voice
Loading
(Analog)
.
The
total
load
applied
to
a
multichannel
amplifier
is
the
sum
of
the
loads
in
the
individual
channels
.
There
are
certain
factors
about
speech
transmission
that
tend
to
reduce
and
stabilize
the
total
load
as
the
number
of
channels
increases
.
These
factors
are:
(a)
The
number
and
distribution
of
channels
actively
transmitting
speech
.
(b)
The
volumes
of
speech
in
the
individual
channels
.
74
MIL-STD-
188-100
15
November
1972
In
determining
the
channel
loading
of
a
multichannel
voice
system,
considerable
advantage
may
be
taken
of
the
statistical
distribution
of
the
speech
signals
.
For
example,
the
activity
factor
for
a
channel
or
the
percentage
of
time
in
the
busiest
traffic
hour
a
channel
might
be
active
in
multichannel
systems
is
about
25
percent
.
For
smaller
groups
of
channels
this
percentage
may
be
larger,
but
it
is
highly
unlikely
that
any
increase
in
group
size
would
change
it
appreciably.
Utilization
of
this
activity
factor
results
in
a
decrease
of
the
mean
power
(-10
dBm0)
of
a
voice
channel
(short
term
average
of
active
channel)
to
a
mean
power
of
-16
dBm0
for
a
voice
channel
(long
term
average
)
.
The
volumes
of
speech
in
active
voice
channels
will
also
affect
the
total
load
.
Speech
volumes
are
not
constant
in
a
channel
,
but
vary
considerably,
depending
on
the
characteristics
of
the
talker's
speech
and
the
loudness
of
his
voice
.
The
changes
in
active
channels
and
in
speech
volumes
concern
only
the
maximum
rms
load
on
a
multichannel
amplifier,
causing
more
and
more
gradual
variations
as
the
number
of
channels
increases
.
However,
it
is
the
total
input
voltage
applied
to
the
amplifier,
and
not
just
the
rms
portion,
that
determines
whether
the
amplifier
will
overload
.
This
total
voltage
is
the
vector
sum
of
the
instantaneous
voltages
in
the
separate
channels
and
is
a
function
of
both
the
phase
and
amplitude
of
each
speech
signal
.
In
consideration
of
the
above
statistical
aspects
of
voice
and
the
associated
probabilities
,
loading
formulas
were
established
by
Holbrook
and
Dixon
and
are
recommended
by
CCIR
.
These
formulas
give
the
mean
absolute
power
(Pm)
of
the
distributed
speech
signals
that
the
system
must
be
capable
of
carrying
.
The
signal
power
depends
on
the
number
of
channels
involved,
and
is
calculated
from
one
of
the
two
formulas
(see
Figure
4.5-3)
:
P
=
-1
+
4

N

(12

dBm0
m
or
P
m
=
-15
+
10
log
N,
(N
>
240

dBm0
The
formulas
include
a
small
margin
for
loads
caused
by
signaling
tones
,
pilot
signals
,
and
carrier
leak
.
4.5.2.1.2
Data
Loading
(Quasi
-Analog)
.
Data
signals
are
,
more
or
less
,
of
constant
amplitude
in
contrast
to
the
wide
variations
of
speech
.
Thus
,
the
average
power
of
a
data
signal
is
continuous
and
imposes
greater
loads
on
the
multichannel
amplifier
than
that
of
a
voice
signal
which
is
present
only
part
of
the
time
.
The
loading
imposed
by
telegraph
and
data
signals
is
calculated
from
the
following
formula

NOTE
1:
In
contemporary
switched
multichannel
systems,
the
combination
of
voice
,
teletype
,
and
data
loading
(with
a
data
loading
of
-10
dBm0
mean
power
per
channel
)
produces
a
resultant
composite
loading
level
that
is
reasonably
compatible
with
the
specific
overload
characteristics
of
FDM
equipment
based
on
Holbrook
and
Dixon
and
on
CCIR
criteria
.
NOTE
2:
When
all
or
nearly
all
of
the
FDM
channels
are
devoted
to
data,
telegraph,
or
digital
facsimile
,
the
resultant
loading
(-10
+10
log
N)
dBm0
is
approximately
3.2
times
higher
than
the
CCIR
loading
.
Thus
,
if
there
were
a
need
for
300
data
channels
,
and
only
voice
type
FDM
and
radio
equipment
(not
designed
for
continuous
data
loading
of
(-10
+10
log
N)
dBm0
are
available
,
then
the
system
engineering
loading
must
be
the
same
as
if
a
960
-channel
voice
loaded
system
were
deployed
.
In
actual
system
practice,
where
both
types
of
FDM
and
radio
equipment
(designed
for
voice
service
only
or
for
voice
and
data
service)
may
be
found,
the
data
loading
is
reduced
from
-10
dBm0
to
-13
dBm0
mean
power
per
channel
in
order
to
prevent
overloading
the
system
.
As

Objective,
all

equipment
shall
be
designed

4.5.3
Characteristics
of
Single
TDM/PCM
Reference
Voice
Bandwidth
Link
.
Basic
features
of
PCM
have
been
outlined
in
subparagraph
4.1.2.5.2
.
Due
to
the
advantages
of
digital
transmission
in
general
and
of
PCM
in
particular
,
this
modulation
scheme
is
gaining
wide
acceptance
not
only
in
military
but
also
in
commercial
communications
.
Since
PCM
transmission
is
compatible
with
the
audio
channel
described
in
subparagraphs
4.4.3.1
and
4.4.3.2
,
TDM/
PCM
reference
voice
bandwidth
links
can
be
connected
in
tandem
with
FDM
reference
voice
bandwidth
links
on
an
audio
channel
-by-channel
basis
.
Thus
,
a
hybrid
communication
system
can
be
engineered
employing
digital
(TDM/
PCM)
and
analog
(
FDM)
transmissions
.
An
example
of
such
a
hybrid
system
is
the
planned
introduction
of
TDM/
PCM
satellite
transmission
links
into
the
DCS
.
This
satellite
subsystem
will
employ
8-bit
PCM
with
a
sampling
rate
of
8000
samples
per
second
resulting
in
a
digital
bit
stream
of
64
kb/s
for
each
audio
channel
.
On
the
other
hand,
the
tactical
highly
maneuverable
communication
system
uses
a
6
-bit
PCM
scheme
with
48
kb/s
for
each
audio
channel
,
resulting
in
less
bandwidth
requirement
of
the
radio
spectrum
and
in
lower
voice
quality
as
compared
with
the
DCS
satellite
subsystem
.
The
TDM/
PCM
reference
voice
bandwidth
link
for
long
haul
and
tactical
communications
is
shown
in
Figure
4.5-8
.
The
voice
bandwidth
link
starts
with
a
group
of
audio
channels
at
the
multiplexer
input
.
Each
audio
channel
has
a
nominal
bandwidth
of
4
kHz
and
is
888
MIL-STD-188-100
15
November
1972
capable
of
transmitting
voice
or
,
under
certain
conditions
,
data
in
quasi
-analog
form
.
The
amplitudes
of
the
analog
signal
carried
in
each
audio
channel
are
periodically
sampled
in
time
and
converted
into
a
time
division
multiplexed
PAM
signal
.
Each
PAM
sample
is
then
coded
into
a
n-bit
code
word
and
this
PCM
signal
,
together
with
framing
and
synchronization
pulses
,
appears
at
the
multiplexer
output
where
it
is
fed
into
a
cable
interface
converter
or
a
radio
for
transmission

The
coding
process
of
PCM
approximates
the
infinite
number
of
possible
sampled
amplitudes
of
the
analog
signal
by
a
discrete
and
therefore
finite
number
of
digital
code
words
(quantization)
.
Due
to
this
quantization
process
,
a
certain
amount
of
approximation
error
is
inherently
introduced
.
This
type
of
error
is
called
quantizing
noise
which
is
an
important
parameter
for
describing
and
measuring
the
quality
of
digitized
voice
transmission.
Once
the
analog
information
is
converted
into
a
quantized
digital
signal
it
can
be
transmitted
over
tactical
and
global
distances
by
using
regenerative
repeaters
with
little
or
no
additional
degradation
if
the
signal
is
above
threshold
.
Noise
can
cause
errors
which
regeneration
including
error
control
may
not
be
able
to
correct
.
Thus
,
the
consideration
of
media
noise
specified
in
subparagraph
4.5.2.3.3
is
not
applicable
to
PCM
transmission
.
However,
demodulating
the
digital
signal
to
analog
baseband
for
analog
processing
(
switching,
patching,
etc.
)
and
modulating
it
back
into
a
digital
form
for
further
transmission
will
introduce
additional
quantizing
noise
and
thus
degrade
the
voice
quality
.
Therefore,
in
such
systems
,
the
number
of
analog/digital
-digital/analog
conversions
has
to
be
limited
in
order
to
keep
the
received
quantizing
noise
sufficiently
low.
At
the
receiving
end
the
pulse
stream
is
decoded
,
demultiplexed,
and
the
PAM
samples
are
demodulated
to
analog
baseband
.
PCM
quantizing
noise
is
not
present
per
se
when
the
audio
channel
is
idle
but
appears
together
with
the
analog
signal
at
the
receiver
and
varies
with
the
instantaneous
amplitude
of
the
analog
signal
.
However,
PCM
idle
channel
noise
is
present
whenever
information
is
not
transmitted
(see
subparagraph
4.5.3.4.1)
.
Therefore,
quantizing
noise
influences
intelligibility
in
a
different
way
than
thermal
noise
does
.
One
method
of
determining
the
influence
of
quantizing
noise
on
intelligibility
is
by
comparing
subjective
listener
tests
of
speech
received
through
two
parallel
audio
channels
.
In
one
channel
the
speech
is
transmitted
in
digitized
form
derived
from
PCM
;
in
the
other
channel
the
same
speech
is
transmitted
in
analog
(non
-digitized)
form
.
For
89
MIL
-STD-
188-100
15
November
1972
this
comparison,
the
thermal
noise
in
the
non-digitized
speech
channel
is
simulated
by
a
noise
generator
which
has
an
adjustable
noise
power
output
.
An
amount
of
thermal
noise
power
in
the
non-digitized
speech
channel
can
be
determined
such
that
the
thermal
noise
has
a
similar
effect
on
the
speech
quality
as
the
quantizing
noise
which
is
generated
in
the
PCM
channel
.
The
amount
of
thermal
noise
power
determined
by
this
comparison
is
called
the
equivalent
PCM
noise
.
For
the
purpose
of
this
standard,
the
equivalent
PCM
noise
is
used
to
determine
the
contributions
by
TDM/PCM
links
to
the
total
circuit
noise
when
FDM
and
TDM/
PCM
links
are
connected
in
tandem
for
voice
service
(see
subparagraph
4.5.3.4.3)
.
The
following
parameters
given
in
subparagraphs
4.5.3.2
through
4.5.3.12
are
for
a
single
link
when
properly
terminated
.
A
single
link
in
this
context
comprises
a
channel
which
joins
two
points
and
wherein
the
analog
signal
is
coded
into
digital
form
at
the
originating
end
of
the
channel
,
for
transmission
over
the
entire
channel
under
consideration,
and
decoded
into
analog
at
the
terminating
end
of
the
channel
.
The
characteristics
of
this
nominal
4

channel
are
specified
for
the
four
-wire
analog
input
and
output
terminals
of
the
link
(see

.
The

of

are

4.5.3.4
Noise
.
4.5.3.4.1
Idle
Channel
Noise
.
PCM
idle
channel
noise
of
a
single
voice
bandwidth
link
and
of
several
links
in
tandem
is
generally
much
lower
than
FDM
idle
channel
noise
.
Therefore,
to
the
operation/maintenance
personnel
and
to
the
user,
the
PCM
channel
may
appear
out
of
service
when
information
is
not
transmitted
.
One
method
of
avoiding
this
misjudgment
is
employing
a
noise
generator
in
the
PCM
multiplexer
which
inserts
a
small
amount
of
thermal
noise
into
the
TDM/
PAM
signal
common
to
an
audio
channel
group
before
the
PAM
signal
is
coded
into
a
PCM
signal
.
The
noise
generator
is
adjusted
at
a
mean
noise
level
which
will
cause
a
variation
of
one
coder
level
.
This
random
change

Transfer
Characteristics

4.6.1
General
.
Assumed
methods
for
summation
of
the
individual
link
transfer
characteristics
to
obtain
the
corresponding
tandem
characteristic
are
given
in
the
following
subparagraphs
4.6.2
through
4.6.5
.
In
general
,
these
assumed
methods
should
only
be
used
if
the
parameters
contributed
by
the
single
links
are
specified
over
identical
frequency
ranges
.
However,
if
the
parameters
are
specified
over
different
frequency
ranges,
then
the
smaller
frequency
range
will
govern
the
overall
frequency
response
and
the
summation
rule
should
only
be
applied
to
the
smaller
frequency
range
.
For
example,
when
the
insertion
loss
versus
frequency
characteristic
of
loops
and
links
in
tandem
are
combined
to
obtain
the
reference
circuit
characteristics
of
paragraph
4.7
,
the
summation
rules
have
been
applied
with
respect
to
the
frequency
bandwidth
assumed
for
the
loops
.
These
summation
methods
are
applicable
to
analog
service
(voice
and
facsimile)
on
a
user-to-user
basis
by
considering
loop
and
channel
characteristics
in
tandem
.
These
methods
are
also
applicable
to
data
service
from
the
transmitting
quasi
-analog
modem
output
to
the
receiving
quasi
-analog
modem
input,
providing
there
is
no
regeneration
employed
between
the
modems
.
If
regeneration
is
employed
then
each
regeneration
point
acts
as
a
data
sink/data
source
combination
and
the
summation
methods
will
only
be
applicable
from
regeneration
point
to
regeneration
point
and
not
on
a
circuit
basis
from
user-to
-user
.
4.6.2
Noise
.
It
is
assumed
that
the
total
noise
power
in
picowatts
of
FDM
or
TDM/
PCM
reference
links
in
tandem
is
the
sum
of
the
noise
powers
in
picowatts
contributed
by
the
single
links
,
provided
the
noise
powers
are
referenced
to
the
same
transmission
level
point
(TLP)
and
represent
the
same
type
of
noise,
e.g.
,
worst
hour
median
noise
or
all
year
median
noise
.
If
the
noise
powers
are
not
referenced
to
the
same
TLP
then
they
have
to
be
converted
to
a
common
TLP
before
they
can
be
summed
.
Noise
powers
expressed
in
units
of
dB
cannot
be
added
algebraically
but
must
be
converted
first
to
units
of
picowatts
.
When
FDM
and
TDM/
PCM
links
are
connected
in
tandem
for

the
equivalent
PCM

to
the
total
circuit
noise
(see
subparagraphs
4.5.3
and
4.5.3.4.3)
.

For
the
purpose
of
this
standard,
the
following
approximate

between

is
used:

:
User
-to
-User
Characteristics
Based
on
Examples
1
The
user-
to
-user
characteristics
may
be
determined
by
combining
the
char-
acteristics
of
a
hypothetical
reference
circuit
(Examples
1
through
4)
with
the
characteristics
of
the
loops
,
which
connect
the
users
to
the
reference
circuit
.
The
characteristics
of
loops
will
vary
widely
among
tactical
highly
maneuverable
users
,
tactical
less
maneuverable
users
,
and
long
haul
users
.
In
addition
to
the
different
types
of
loops
,
the
length
may
range
from
very
short
loops
consisting
entirely
of
local
plant
facilities
or
loaded/nonloaded
cable
pairs
,
to
very
long
loops
consisting
of
one
or
more
sections
of
a
long
haul
plant
,
such
as
a
loaded
toll
grade
cable
or
a
carrier
plus
an
end
section
consisting
of
local
plant
facilities
.
As
may
be
expected
,
the
inherent
characteristics
of
the
loops
will
vary
widely
and
are
predictable
only
when
the
specific
makeup
of
a
loop
is
known.
Each
loop
is
a
separate
problem
and
each
loop
must
be
individually
engineered
.
Thus
,
for
purposes
of
demonstrating
the
calculation
of
hypothetical
user-
to
-user
characteristics
(for
Examples
1
through
4)
,
it
is
necessary
to
assume
characteristics
for
the
loop.
The
reader
is
cautioned
that
these
assumed
characteristics
are
not
real
values
and
are
not
to
be
used
literally
for
the
calculation
of
actual
user
-to
-user
characteristics
.

4.7.9.1.1
Long

Highly
Maneuverable
Four
-Wire
Reference
Circuit
.
Different
requirements
for
the
long
haul
and
the
tactical
highly
maneuverable
systems
have
led
to
the
development
of
equipment
,
such
as
multiplexers
and
radios
,
with
significantly
different
traffic
signal
levels
(voice
and
data)
and
overload
characteristics
.
THEREFORE
,
SPECIAL
METHODS
HAVE
TO
BE
USED
FOR
INTERFACING
LONG
HAUL
WITH
TACTICAL
HIGHLY
MANEUVERABLE
LINKS
.
Figure
4.7-8
(Example
8a)
shows
a
signal
level
and
interface
diagram
of
a
long
haul/
tactical
highly
maneuverable
four
-wire
reference
circuit
.
The
interface
shall
be
accomplished
on
the
basis
of
the
standard
test
tone
defined
in
subparagraph
4.4.3.2.2.4
as
-10
dBm0
for
the
long
haul
and
-3
dBm0
for
the
tactical
highly
maneuverable
system
.
It
should
be
emphasized
that
the
standard
test
tone
of
-10
dBm0
for
the
long
haul
system
is
referenced
to
the
long
haul
0TLP,
whereas
the
test
tone
of
-3
dBm0
for
the
tactical
highly
maneuverable
system
is
referenced
to
the
tactical
highly
maneuverable
0TLP
and
not
to
the
long
haul
OTLP
.
The
method
of
interfacing
on
the
basis
of
the
standard
test
tone
results
in
a
3
dB
gain
at
the
interface
point
for
signals
traversing
from
the
long
haul
to
the
tactical
highly
maneuverable
portion
of
a
circuit
and
in
a
3
dB
attenuation
at
the
interface
point
for
signals
traversing
from
the
tactical
highly
maneuverable
to
the
long
haul
portion
of
a
circuit
.
THE
TLPS
OF
THE
TACTICAL
HIGHLY
MANEUVERABLE
SYSTEM
CANNOT
BE
DIRECTLY
EQUATED
TO
THE
TLPS
OF
THE
LONG
HAUL
SYSTEM
,
SAVE
IN
TERMS
OF
ACTUAL
POWER
LEVELS
(dBm)
.
THEREFORE
,
THESE
TLPS
SHALL
BE
CONSIDERED
AS
INTERNAL
REFERENCES
FOR
EACH
SYSTEM
ONLY,
AND
MUST
NOT
BE
TRANSFERRED
ACROSS
THE
INTERFACE
.
For
this
reason
,
the
standard
test
signal
and
the
signal
for
intermodulation
distortion
measurements
(
IMD)
shall
not
be
transmitted
across
a
long
haul/tactical
highly
maneuverable
interface
,
as
indicated
in
Figure
4.7-8
.
The
monitoring
test
tone
is
not
used
in
the
tactical
highly
maneuverable
system
(see
subparagraph
4.4.3.2.2.5)
.
However,
the
monitoring
test
tone
may
be
transmitted
across
the
interface
,
if
required
,
and
would
appear
at
a
level
of
-12
dBm
at
a
-4
TLP
of
a
tactical
highly
maneuverable
circuit
.
In
Figure
4.7-8,
the
transmitted
speech
volumes
at
the
telephones
have
been
assumed
as
-10
VU
for
both
the
long
haul
and
the
tactical
highly
maneuverable
users
in
accordance
with
subparagraph
4.2.2.1
.
The
received
speech
volume
of
−16.5
VU
at
the
tactical
highly
maneuverable
telephone
is
higher
than
the
nominal
value
of
-28
VU
stated
in
subparagraph
4.2.2.2
but
the
higher
value
is
considered
desirable
for
satisfactory
service
in
a
tactical
highly
maneuverable
environment
.
The
received
speech
volume
of
-22.5
VU
at
the
long
haul
telephone
is
within
the
range
of
volume
units
given
in
subparagraph
4.2.2.2
indicating
that
more
than
95
percent
of
calls
would
be
rated
good
or
better
.
The
data
levels
shown
in
Figure
4.7-8
are
identical
with
the
values
stated
in
subparagraphs
4.3.2.2
and
4.4.3.2.2.2
.

NOTE:
The
following
items
have
been
considered
for
the
development
of
an
interface
standard
between
the
tactical
highly
maneuverable
system
and
the
long
haul
or
the
tactical
less
maneuverable
systems:
(a)
The
level
difference
across
the
interface
is
caused
by
the
current
inventory
which
cannot
be
changed
significantly
in
the
foreseeable
future
based
on
economic
factors
,
such
as
equipment
life
cycles
.
(b)
Any
solution
of
the
interface
problem
should
have
a
minimum
impact
on
existing
procedures
and
practices
used
in
all
systems
to
be
interfaced
.
(c)
The
introduction
of
a
new
definition
into
the
tactical
highly
maneuverable
system,
namely
the
standard
test
tone
of
-3
dBm0,
is
considered
less
confusing
to
communications
personnel
than
a
change
of
established
procedures
and
methods
employed
within
a
system
,
such
as
the
TLP
concept
.
(d)
The
method
of
interfacing
on
the
basis
of
the
standard
test
tone
will
affect
only
circuits
traversing
the
long
haul/
tactical
highly
maneuverable
system
or
the
tactical
less
maneuverable/tactical
highly
maneuverable
system
and
will
not
change
established
test
or
alignment
procedures
within
any
of
these
systems
.

higher
than
the
nominal

subparagraph
4.2.2.2
but
the

The
difference
between
the
two
systems
is
in
the
area
of
loops
.
Long
haul
four-wire
reference
circuits
maintain
a
6
dB
loss
in
the
loop
.
The
less
maneuverable
tactical
four-wire
reference
circuits
have
loops
with
a
mean
loss
of
7
dB
.
This
difference
causes
the
transmitted
and
received
levels
of
speech
and
data
to
differ
slightly
as
shown
in
Figure
4.7-10
.

Figure
4.7-11
(Example

provides
a
signal
level
and
interface
diagram
for
a
long
haul/
tactical
less
maneuverable
two
-wire
reference
circuit
.
This
is
very
similar
to
Figure
4.7-10
which
addresses
a
long
haul/less
maneuverable
tactical
four-wire
reference
circuit,
the
major
difference
between
them
being
the
additional
loop
loss
shown
for
both
the
long
haul
two
-wire
reference
circuits
(11
dB
including
a
4
-dB
two
-wire
to
four
-wire
hybrid
loss)
and
the
tactical
less
maneuverable
two
-wire
reference
circuits
(9
dB
including
two-wire
to
four-wire
hybrid
loss
)
.
As
a
result
ofthese
additional
loop
losses
,
the
values
of
data
and
voice
signal
levels
change
accordingly
from
the
values
shown
on
Figure
4.7-10
(Example
8c)
.
The
major
impact
is
in
the
received
speech
volume
(-30
VU)
at
both
the
long
haul
and
the
tactical
less
maneuverable
telephone
instrument
.
However,
this
level
of
-30
VU
is
within
the
range
of
received
speech
volume
required
for
satisfactory
voice
service
(see
subparagraph

almost
identical
to
the

shown
in
Figure
4.7-8
(Example

.
The
differences
in
signal
level
values
shown
on

are
due
to
the
7

loss
on
the
tactical

as
compared
to
the

provided
in

.
The
only
change

is
the

4.7.9.2
Calculation
of
Hypothetical
Noise
Power
at
User
Terminals
.
The
total
received
noise
at
the
user
terminals
will
consist
of
channel
noise
plus
the
noise
contributed
by
the
two
loops
,
attenuated
by
the
one
-way
insertion
loss
of
the
loop
connecting
the
user
terminals
to
the
channel
(see
Figure
4.4-1)
.
It
is
accepted
practice
in
circuit
engineering
to
reference
each
noise
power
value
,
contributed
by
the
different
portions
of
a
circuit,
to
the
0TLP
of
the
circuit
under
consideration
and
thus
arrive
at
the
total
circuit
noise
power
expressed
in
units
of
pWp0
or
dBrnco
.
The
total
circuit
noise
power
referenced
to
the
0TLP
can
be
transferred
from
the
OTLP
to
any
other
TLP
of
the
circuit
by
considering
the
transmission
level
difference
between
the
0TLP
and
the
other
TLP
(see
Appendix
F,
Terms
and
Definitions

the
loops
,
and
the

circuit
noise
power
at
the
long

or
tactical
user
terminals
based
on
the
reference
circuit
Examples
1
through

.
The
parameters
of
Examples
1
through
4
,
such
as
noise
and
envelope
delay
distortion
shown
in
subparagraphs
4.7.2
through
4.7.5,
are
only
applicable
to
analog
service
(voice
and
facsimile)
and
to
quasi-analog
data
service
without
regeneration
between
the
end
terminals
of
a
channel
.
See
subparagraph
4.6.1
for
calculating
the
transfer
characteristics
of
data
links
in
tandem
with
regeneration
employed
.
In
the
first
column
of
Table
4.7-1,
the
numbers
of
the
reference
circuit
examples
are
listed
which
correspond
to
Figures
4.7-1
through
4.7-4
.
The
second
column
of
Table
4.7-1
shows
the
channel
noise
power
referenced
to
the
long
haul
or
the
tactical
less
maneuverable
0TLP
.
The
values
of
channel
noise
power
listed
in
Table
4.7-1
are
identical
with
the
values
shown
in
Figures
4.7-1
through
4.7-4
.
The
noise
contributed
by
one
loop
(see
subparagraph
4.4.2.1.4)
is
listed
in
the
third
column
of
Table
4.7-1
.
It
should
be
noted
that
in
the
tactical
highly
maneuverable
system
the
loop
noise
is
generally
so
much
lower
than
the
noise
contributed
by
trunks
and
links
that
the
effect
of
loop
noise
on
a
user-to-user
circuit
is
considered
negligible
.
Consequently,
the
total
circuit
noise
of
Examples
3
and
4
consists
of
channel
noise
plus
noise
of
one
long
haul
loop,
whereas
the
total
circuit
noise
of
Examples
1
and
2
is
the
sum
of
channel
noise
plus
the
noise
contributed
by
one
long
haul
loop
and
one
tactical
less
maneuverable
loop
.

based
on
the
four-wire
loop
insertion
loss
stated
in
subparagraphs
4.4.2.1.1.1
and
4.4.2.1.1.3,
respectively
.
Examples
3
and
4
also
show
a
-6
TLP
assumed
at
a
long
haul
end
instrument
and
a
−7.5
TLP
assumed
at
a
tactical
highly
maneuverable
end
instrument
in
accordance
with
Figure
4.7-8
.
The
last
column
of
Table
4.7-1
shows
the
total
received
circuit
noise
power
at
the
assumed
TLPs
of
long
haul
or
tactical
end
instruments
.
For
Examples
1
and
2
,
the
total
noise
at
the
user
TLP
is
calculated
by
subtracting
from
the
circuit
noise
(expressed
in
dBrnc0)
6
dB
for
a
long
haul
user
or
7
dB
for
a
tactical
highly
maneuverable
user
in
accordance
with
the
corresponding
assumed
TLPs
.
Since
the
TLP
of
a
tactical
highly
maneuverable
circuit
is
not
related
to
the
long
haul
0TLP
in
terms
of
transmission
power
levels
,
the
calculation
of
total
circuit
noise
at
the
tactical
highly
maneuverable
end
instrument
(
Examples
3
and
4
of
Table
4.7-1)
must
not
be
performed
by
the
conventional
method
used
for
Examples
1
and
2
but
has
to
be
based
on
the
interface
diagram
shown
in
Figure
4.7-8
.
According
to
Figure
4.7-8,
a
signal
traversing
the
interface
from
the
long
haul
0TLP
to
the
tactical
highly
maneuverable
-4
TLP
is
amplified
by
3
dB
.
Likewise
,
circuit
noise
power
referenced
to
the
long
haul
OTLP,
as
shown
in
the
fourth
column
of
Table
4.7-1
,
will
be
3
dB
higher
at
the
tactical
highly
maneuverable
-4
TLP.
This
amount
of
noise
power
at
the
-4
TLP
is
attenuated
by
the
loop
loss
of
3.5
dB
at
the
tactical
highly
maneuverable
user
terminal
.
For
instance,
reference
circuit
Example
3
of
Table
4.7-1
has
a
total
circuit
noise
of
47.2
dBrnc0
(referenced
to
the
long
haul
0TLP)
plus
3
dB
(gain
at
the
long
haul/
tactical
interface)
minus
3.5
dB
(of
tactical
loop
insertion
loss
)
resulting
in
46.7
dBrnc
of
total
circuit
noise
power
at
the
tactical
(highly
maneuverable)
user
terminals
.
The
total
circuit
noise
shown
in
the
last
column
of
Figure
4.7-1
is
within
the
limits
of
received
noise
power
for
voice,
analog
facsimile
and
data
service
given
in
subparagraphs
4.2.2.3,
4.2.3.3,
and
4.3.2.4
respectively
.
The
permissible
noise
of
44
dBrnc
shown
in
subparagraph
4.2.2.3
is
based
on
a
mean
received
speech
volume
of
-28
VU
.
The
tactical
highly
maneuverable
system
has
a
higher
received
speech
volume
(see
Figure
4.7-8)
and
therefore
can
tolerate
more
noise
power
at
the
user
terminals
than
stated
in
subparagraph
4.2.2.3
.

NOTE:
Reference
circuits
3
and
4
seemingly
exceed
the
44
dBrnc
standard
stated
in
subparagraph
4.2.2.3
.
One
must
remember,
however,
that
the
44
dBrnc
in
subparagraph
4.2.2.3
is
tied
to
a
-28
VU
speech
volume
.
In
the
reference
circuits
,
the
speech
level
at
the
tactical
highly
maneuverable
user
terminals
is
considerably
higher
(-17
VU).
In
real
circuits
there
will
be
some
attenuation
at
all
switch
and
interconnect
points
which
will
amount
to
several
dB
effective
attenuation
of
the
signals
arriving
at
either
user
terminals
,
thus
dropping
the
noise
power
within
the
standard
limit
of
44
dBrnc
while
the
speech
volume
will
stay
above
-28
VU
.
4.7.9.3
Calculation
of
Hypothetical
Insertion
Loss
Versus
Frequency
Characteristic
at

.
By
applying
the
summation
method
defined
in
subparagraph
4.6.3
the
total
resultant
hypothetical
insertion
loss
versus
frequency
characteristic
at
the
user
terminals
may
be
obtained
.
This
involves
the
summarizing
of
the
insertion
loss
versus
frequency
characteristic
for
the
hypothetical
reference
links
Examples
1
through
4
described
in
subparagraph
4.7.2
and
the
loop
characteristics
given
in
subparagraph
4.4.2.2.2
considering
the
contributions
of
two
loops
.
The
following
examples
are
for
unconditioned
data
loops
and
unconditioned
data
circuits
only
.
The
same
method
of
summarizing
would
apply
to
other
types
of

and
circuits
.

Net
loss
is
the
nominal
insertion
loss
at
test
tone
frequency
of
any
transmission
link,
measured
between
points
at
which
they
interconnect
with
another
link
at
a
switching
equipment,
or
to
the
line
terminals
of
a
telephone
.
This
includes
trunks
,
subscriber
or
switch
access
lines
,
switch
tie
lines
,
and
user
loops
.
The
sum
of
the
net
losses
of
all
links
in
tandem
between
the
line
terminals
of
the
two
interconnected
telephones
is
the
net
loss
of
the
connection
.
The
overall
net
loss
allowable
takes
into
account
the
user
-to
-user
requirements
and,
if
there
are
any
2-wire
links
or
2-wire
telephones
which
may
form
part
of
the
connection
,
echo
control
must
be
considered
(see
subparagraph
4.2.2.8).
Although
the
net
loss
design
of
the
tactical
systems
and
the
long
haul
system
do
not
entirely
agree,
the
net
loss
of
a
4-wire
trunk,

switching
points
,
shall
be
0

and
the
net

modems
are
devices
which
allow
digital
information
to
be
transmitted

analog
facilities
.
The
sending
portion
of
the
modem
converts
dc
pulses
into
analog
tones
suitable
for
transmission
over
analog
circuits
;
the
receiving
portion
of
the
modem
accepts
analog
tones
from
the
transmission
facility
and
converts
them
into
dc
pulses
for
use
by
the
end
instrument.
Included
herein
are
standards
which
are
common
to
modems
used
for
tactical
applications
and
those
used
on
the
long-haul
system
.
The
standards
regarding
interface
and
timing
criteria,
although
applicable
to
digital
modems
,
are
relevant
to
a
wide
variety
of
other
subsystems
as
well
;
therefore
the
discussion
herein
references
the
reader
to
subparagraphs

Meteorological
Facsimile

Facsimile
is
extensively
employed
throughout
the
world
for
meteorological
communications
.
The
majority
of
the
systems
in
use
are
scheduled
broadcasts
employing
wire
or
radio
facilities
.
When
employing
wire
,
amplitude
modulation
is
employed
.
When
employing
radio
,
either
amplitude
modulation
or
frequency
modulation
(
FSK)
is
employed
.
When
frequency
modulation
is
employed
,
an
ancillary
device
to
convert
amplitude
to/from
frequency
modulation
is
required.
It
is
expected
that
the
use
of

will
be
expanded
in
the
future.
There

Paper
Tape
Readers
.
There

classes
of
mechanical
tape
readers
:
(
1)
Coincident
selection
in
which
all
pins
of
the
tape
reader
sense
the
tape
simultaneously
;
and
(2
)
sequential
selection
readers
in
which
pins
are
successively
presented
to
the
tape
to
determine
the
presence
or
absence
of
a
perforation.
Each
method
of
selection
has
certain
mechanical
design
advantages
.
Many
of
the
modern
tape
readers
employ
a
photosensitive
technique
for
determining
the
presence
or
absence
of
a
perforation.
Some
of
these
readers
operate
on
the
"
sequential
selection"
principle
but
operation
on
the
"
coincident
selection
"
principle
is
more
predominant
.
There
are
no
standards
established
at

that
the
reader
can

Punches
.
The
paper
tape
punch
is
an
end
instrument
designed
for
the
recording
of
information
on
punched
paper
tape
.
The
drive
pulses
required
to
activate
the
punch
may
be
furnished
by
a
typewriter
keyboard,
data
communications
circuit
,
or
other
digital
instrumentation
.
There
are
two
basic
types
of
punches
:
(1)
Nonprinting
punches
in
which
only
data
and
feed
holes
are
punched
in
the
tape
;
and
(2)
printing
punches
in
which
,
in
addition
to
punching
data
and
feed
holes
,
the
characters
are
printed
on
the
tape
(
see
Figure
5.8-1
)
.
There
are
two
methods
of
printing
the
tape
:
(
1)
The
printing
is
in
line
with
the
feed
holes
and
six
characters
behind
the
corresponding
data
holes
;
and
(

the
printing
is
between
the
sixth
and
seventh
feed
holes
following
the
corresponding
data
holes
(
see
Figure

)
.
In

type
of
punch
there
are
two
methods
of
punching

.
Whenever
the
full
designation
of
an
emission
is
necessary
,
the
symbol
for
that
emission
,
as
given
above
,
shall
be
preceded
by
a
number
indicating
in
kilohertz
the
necessary
bandwidth
of
the
emission.
Bandwidths
shall
generally
be
expressed
to
a
maximum
of
three
significant
figures
,
the
third
figure
being
almost
always
a
nought
or
a
five
.
10.1.2.1
Examples
of
Necessary
Bandwidths
and
Designations
of
Emission
,
The
necessary
bandwidth
may
be
determined
by
one
of
the
following
methods
:
(a
)
Use
of
the
formulae
included
in
the
following
table
which
also
gives
examples
of
necessary
bandwidths
and
designation
of
corresponding
emissions
.
(b)
Computation
in
accordance
with
CCIR
recommendations
.
(c)
Measurement
,
in
cases
not
covered
by
(a)
or
(b)
above
.
The
value
so
determined
should
be
used
when
the
full
designation
of
an
emission
is
required.
However
,
the
necessary
bandwidth
so
determined
is
not
the
only
characteristic
of
an
emission
to
be
considered
in
evaluating
the
interference
that
may
be
caused
by
that
emission.
In
the
formulation
of
the
following
table
,
these
terms
have
been
employed
:

Necessary
bandwidth
in
Hz
.
B

B
=
Telegraph

N
=

,
in

.
M
=
Maximum
modulation
frequency
in

.
C
=
Subcarrier
frequency
in

D
=
Half
the
difference
between
the
maximum
and
minimum
values
of
the
instantaneous
frequency

t
=
Pulse
duration
in
seconds.
Instantaneous
frequency
is
the
rate
K
=
An
overall
numerical
factor
which
varies
according
to
the
emission
and
which
depends

Name
of
Standard
.
The
standard
coded
character
set
used
is
titled
"Code
for
Information
Interchange"
.
The
standard
code
may
be
identified
by
the
use
of
the
notation
ASCII
(pronounced
as
'
-key)
and
should
ordinarily
be
taken
to
mean
the
code
prescribed
by
the
latest
issue
of
the
standard
that
was
approved
as
a
USA
Standard
by
the
United
States
of
America
Standards
Institute
on
October
10
,
1968.
This
USA
Standard
was
adopted
as
a
Federal
Information
Processing
Standard
and
approved
by
the
President
of
the
United
States
on
March
11
,
1968
.
The
Code
for
Information
Interchange
was
issued
by
the
National
Bureau
of
Standards
as
a
Federal
Information
Processing
Standard
(FIPS)
on
November
1
,
1968.

X3.4-1967
and
in
part
X3.4-1968
(a
revision
of
X3.4-1967)
.
That
portion
of
X3.4-1968
which
has
not
been
adopted
in
this
Federal
standard
is
the
"

and
associated
equipment
is
shown
in
Figure

General
Considerations
.
(a)
This
standard
does
not
define
the
means
by
which
the
coded
set
is
to
be
recorded
in
any
physical
medium,
nor
does
it
include
any
redundancy
or
define
techniques
for
error
control
.
Further,
this
standard
does
not
define
data
communication
formats
,
code
extension
techniques
,
or
graphic
representation
of
control
characters
.
(b)
Deviations
from
the
standard
may
create
serious
difficulties
in
information
interchange
and
should
be
used
only
with
full
cognizance
of
the
parties
involved.
(c)
The
relative
sequence
of
any
two
characters
,
when
used
as
a
basis
for
collation,
is
defined
by
their
binary
values
.
(d)
No
specific
meaning
is
prescribed
for
any
of
the
graphics
in
the
code
table
except
that
which
is
understood
by
the
users
.
Furthermore
,
this
standard
does
not
specify
a
type
style
for
the
printing
or
display
of
the
various
graphic
characters
.
In
specific
applications
,
it
may
be
desirable
to
employ
distinctive
styling
of
individual
graphics
to
facilitate
their
use
for
specific
purposes
as
,
for
example
,
to
stylize
the
graphics
in
code
positions
2/1
and
5/14
into
those
frequently
associated
with
logical
OR
(1
)
and
logical
NOT
(→
)
,
respectively
.
It
is
to
be
noted
that
these
two
symbols
are
not
standard.

:
Some

20.5
Bit
Sequencing
of
the
Code
for
Information

in
Serial-by-Bit
Data
Transmission
.
Federal
Information
Processing
Standards
Publication
16
(FIPS
PUB
16)
specifies
the
position
of
the
character
parity
bit,
if
transmitted
with
the
information
bits
of
the
Standard
Code
for
Information
Interchange
(FIPS
1
),
in
serial
-by-bit,
serial-by-character
data
transmission
.
This
standard
is
applicable
to
the
transmission
of
the
standard
code
in
a
serial
bit
stream
form
at
the
interface
between
data
terminal
equipment
and
data
communications
equipment
.
20.5.1
Standard
Bit
Sequence
.
The
standard
bit
sequence
for
an
ASCII
character
shall
be
least
significant
bit
first
to
most
significant
bit--in
terms
of
FIPS
nomenclature
(Standard
Code
for
Information
Interchange)
b₁
through
by
in
ascending
(consecutive)
order
.
NOTE:
This
statement
does
not
specify
that
a
character
parity
bit
shall
or
shall
not
be
transmitted,
nor
does
it
specify
the
total
number
of
bits
per
character,
the
bit
rate,
the
character
rate,
or
the
transmission
technique
.
However,
in
the
DoD
the
equipment
ordinarily
should
be
designed
to
transmit
and
receive
a
bit
in
the
parity
position
.
If
the
bit
is
not
used
as
a
parity
bit,
it
should
be
transmitted
as
a
mark
and
ignored
by
the
receiver
.
If
used
as
a
parity
bit,
the
transmitter
and
receiver
must
be
programmed
or
adjusted
accordingly.
The
reason
is
to
preclude
several
types
of
equipment
that
are
incompatible
and
limited
in
their
use
.
Any
equipments
designed
not
to
transmit
and
receive
a
parity
bit
must
be
used
in
limited
and
closed
networks
where
parity
is
not
needed
and
transmission
efficiency
is
paramount
over
equipment
logistics
.
Character
and
bit
rates
are
defined
elsewhere
in
these
standards
.
20.5.2
Character
Parity.
A
character
parity,
if
transmitted,
is
to
follow
the
most
significant
bit,
b7,
of
the
character
to
which
it
applies
.

20.8
Printing
Subsets
of
the
Standard
Code
for

The
last
paragraph
considers
coded
subsets
.
These
coded
subsets
refer
to
the
transmitter/

On
the
other
hand,
printing
subsets
refer
to
receiver

capability
using
specific
symbols
for
certain
or
all
characters
.
For
example,
a
transmitter/receiver
system
may
use
all

A
FIPS
is
in
preparation
on
this
subject
that
is
substantially
the
same
as
Figure
9.
When
published
,
the
FIPS
shall
take
precedence
over
Figure
9
.
20.8.2
94-Character
Printing
Subset
.
This
set
consists
of
the
94
graphics
shown
on
Figure
1.
It
omits
the
32
control
characters
,
space
,
and
delete
shown
in
Figure
9.
This
printing
set
is
used
for
high
quality
data
and
narrative
message
recording
where
both
upper
and
lower
case
printing
is
desired
(
see
Figure
7)
.
This
printing
set
may
be
used
also
for
less
exacting
monitoring
applications
than
those
discussed
in
the
previous
paragraph
by
printing
a
heart
(♡)
for
the
34
symbols
shown
in
Figure
9
.
This
adds
a
95th
symbol
to
the
94-
character
printing
set
.
20.8.3
63-Character
Printing
Subset
.
This
set
consists
of
the
same
graphics
in
the
94-character
printing
set
minus
the
31
characters
,
other
than
Delete
in
columns
6
and
7
;
in
other
words
all
of
the
graphics
in
columns
2
,
3
,
4,
and
5.
This
is
the
normal
communication
printing
subset
that
prints
in
upper
case
only
(see
Figure
8)
.
20.8.4
95-
and
64-Character
Printing
Subset
.
These
two
subsets
are
the
same
as
the
94-
and
63
-character
printing
subset
with
the
addition
of
the
symbol
for
the
substitute
character
(position
1/10
in
Figure
9)
.
When
error
detection
is
used,
this
symbol
is
printed
to
indicate
that
the
character
it
replaced
was
in
error
but
that
the
correct
character
is
unknown.
20.9
The
Standard
Punched
Card
Code
.
ASCII
can
be
used
as
a
punched
card
code
.
Devices
have
been
manufactured
that
punch
both
paper
tape
and
edged
punched
cards
.
There
has
been
some
objection
to
using
ASCII
to
punch
cards
because
pure
numerical
work
results
in
punching
bits
5
and
6
in
all
columns
of
the
card
.
This
is
called
lacing
and
weakens
the
card
.
For
that
reason
,
plus
the
great
investment
in
Hollerith
Card
punching
and
reading
equipment
,
the
Hollerith
punched
card
code
is
still
used
in
most
applications
.
The
code
,
shown
in
Figure
10
,
has
been
extended
to
cover
256
characters
,
including
the
128
ASCII
characters
and
128
additional
but,
as
yet
,
undefined
characters
.
This
code
is
standardized
in
FIPS
PUB
14.
When
using
punched
cards
the
codes
given
in
Figures
10
,
11
,
and
12
shall
be
used
.
This
standard
permits
the
use
of
only
certain
characters
but
equipment
should
have
a
capability
of
operating
with
a
complete
ASCII
set
or
a
complete
95-
or
64-
character
subset
of
ASCII
.
At
present
AUTODIN
uses
a
Hollerith
punched
card
code
set
that
differs
from
FIPS
PUB
14
standard
by
a
few
characters
.
Plans
are
being
formulated
to
rectify
this
situation
.
A
third
version
of
the
Hollerith
punched
card
code
as
published
in
JCS
PUB
7
is
employed
in
the
National
Military
Command
System
.
These
three
versions
are
given
in
Figure
13.
It
is
a
Design
Objective
to
convert
all
systems
to
the
FIPS
14
standard
.
20.9.1

20.10
The
standard
physical
properties
of
the
Five
Unit
Teletypewriter
Coded
Character
Set
.
Teletypewriter
message
transmission
systems
have
been
employed
in
Department
of
Defense
communications
for
a
number
of
years
and
are
expected
to
be
used
for
some
time
to
come
.
The
five
unit
teletypewriter
coded
character
set
(Figure
14)
used
throughout
these
systems
has
for
many
years
been
established
as
a
standard
and
is
included
in
this
publication
as
an
interim
standard
since
it
will
remain
in
use
for
an
undetermined
period
of
time
.

Keyboard
Arrangements
.
The
keyboard
arrangement
used
has
no
bearing
on
interoperability
of
equipment
but
is
important
from
training
and
efficiency
standpoints
.
20.11.1
ASCII
Keyboard
Arrangements
.
Four-
row
keyboards
are
standard
for
the
implementation
of
ASCII
and
for
OCR
message
preparation
units
.
The
standard
arrangements
are
included
in
Figures
15
,
16
,
and
17.
For
details
on
the
application
of
these
arrangements
,
the
designer
is
advised
to
consult
MIL-
STD-1280
,
Keyboard
Arrangements
.
No
FIPS
PUB
has
been
approved
for
keyboard
arrangements
for
Government
use
but
action
is
being
taken
to
develop
a
federal
standard
.
When
such
a
standard
is
approved,
MIL-
STD-1280
will
be
revised
accordingly
.

20.12
EBCDIC
Card
Code
.
The
EBCDIC
card
code
is
widely
used
but
is
not
a
US,
Federal
,
or
DoD
standard
.
It
is
shown
in
Figure
19
for
informational
purposes
only
.
The
128
characters
of
ASCII
each
have
EBCDIC

.
The
remaining
128
characters
of
this
256

code
have
no
character
assignments
as
is
the
case
with
the
Hollerith

card
code
.

FOREWORD
1.
DoD
policy
on
font
standardization
is
contained
in
OASD
(Telecommunications
)
Memorandum
dated
16
Dec.
70
which
is
quoted
in
part
below:
"The
development
of
high
resolution
scanners
and
improved
character
recognition
units
permits
procurement
of
multi
-font
OCRE
on
a
competitive
basis
from
several
firms
.
The
current
generation
OCRE
permits
expansion
of
the
font
reading
capability
by
changes
in
the
software
and
logic
of
the
recognition
units
.
Should
there
be
significant
quantities
of
OCR-A
font
equipped
typewriters
at
a
facility
scheduled
to
receive
OCRE
,
it
is
expected
that
OCR
-A
will
be
specified
as
one
of
the
character
sets
capable
of
being
processed
by
the
equipment
.
In
all
other
situations
selection
of
OCRE
should
be
based
on
a
cost
effectiveness
analysis
with
appropriate
consideration
given
to
the
type
fonts
on
the
equipment
previously
procured
or
programmed
to
be
used
with
the
OCRE
.
"

As
of
this
printing,
the
only
ANSI
(American
National
Standard
Institute)
standard
for
OCRE
is
X3
.
17-1966
which
is
for
OCR-
style

.
Accordingly
•
the
characteristics
of
subparagraph
30.5
.
4
are
those
for
OCR

It
is
expected
that
these

will
be
essentially
the
same
in

currently
being
developed

OPTICAL
CHARACTER
RECOGNITION
EQUIPMENT
30.1
Scope.
This
appendix
concerning
Optical
Character
Recognition
Equipment
(OCRE)
is
applicable
to
communications
only
.
This
OCRE
is
to
be
used
to
generate
binary
electrical
signals
in
the
appropriate
code
and
alphabet
by
a
process
of
reading
(scanning)
messages
prepared
in
a
standard
manner
on
a
standard
message
format
using
typewriters
suitable
for
preparation
of
messages
accurately
readable
by
OCRE
.
The
message
format
is
discussed
in
subparagraph
30.
8.
2
of
this
appendix
.
Suitable
typewriters
are
discussed
in
paragraph
30.
6
of
this
appendix
.
30.2
Purpose
.
This
appendix
is
a
part
of
MIL-
STD-
188-100
and
is
included
to
facilitate
its
use
in
connection
with
OCRE
.
30.3
Use
of
OCRE
.
The
OCRE
may
be
used
on-line
,
feeding
the
generated
signals
directly
to
the
line
or
to
any
of
a
number
of
lines
as
required
by
the
traffic
situ-
ation;
or
the
OCRE
may
be
used
off-line
by
recording
on
paper
tape
,
magnetic
tape
,
drum
,
etc.
When
used
off-line
the
recorded
message
is
subsequently
read
to
the
appropriate
line
.
Which
method
of
operation
is
used
is
a
matter
of
command
prerogative
,
but
the
design
should
be
such
that
both
on-line
and
off-line
operation
is
possible
.
30.4
OCRE
Signals
.
30.4
.
1
Code
and
Alphabet.
The
binary
signals
generated
by
the
OCRE
shall
be
coded
in
the
"
Code
for
Information
Exchange
"
which
is
also
known
as
ASCII
(pronounced
as
'
-key)
or
USASCII
(pronounced
you-
sas
'
-key)
.
This
coded
character
set
is
discussed
in
Appendix
B
,
30.4.2
Low
Level
Signaling.
The
signals
generated
by
the
OCRE
shall
be
in
accordance
with
subparagraph
4.

(
Low
Level
Digital
Interfaces
)
of
the
basic
standard.
30.4
.

Modulation
Rate
.
The
modulation
rate
of
the
OCRE
signal
shall
be
as
specified
in
subparagraph
4.
3.
1.
1
(
Modulation
and
Data
Signaling
Rates)
of
the
basic
standard
.
30.4.4
Character
Reading
Rate
.
The
character
reading
(
scanning)
rate
bears
a
definite
relationship
to
the
rate
at
which
signals
are
dispersed
to
the
line
unless
a
buffer
storage
is
provided
between
the
two
.
The
maximum
scanning
rate
shall
be
consistent
with
the
headquarters
traffic
load,
economics
,
accuracy
in
reading
,
and
sound
engineering
practices
.
30.4.5
Bit
Transmission
.
Bits
(per
character)
transmission
between
the
OCRE
and
the
off-
line
recorder
may
be
in
serial
or
parallel
form
.
When
the
OCRE
is
operating
on-line
the
bit
stream
must
ultimately
be
serialized
before
transmission
.
30.4.6
Parity
.
When
the
ASCII
is
used
pursuant
to
subparagraph
30.
4.

of
this
appendix
,
the
parity
bit
shall
be
generated
by
the
OCRE
in
accordance
with
subparagraphs

OCRE
Capabilities
.
30.5.1
Monocase
ASCII
OCRE
(Preferred
Standard
for
Message
Preparation)
.
The
minimum
reading
capability
of
monocase
OCRE
operating
in
an
ASCII
communication
link
shall
be
the
characters
given
in
Table
I
of
this
appendix
.
Any
additional
character
reading
capability
shall
be
limited
to
those
characters
given
in
Figure
1
of
Appendix
B.
Dualcase
ASCII
OCRE
.
Dual
case
readers
shall
have
the
same
capability
of
reading
lower
case
alphabetic
characters
printed
in
the
same
font
design
as
the
upper
case
alphabetic
characters
.
Dual
case
OCRE
is
not
recommended
for
ordinary
communications
use
because
dualcase
receiving
teleprinters
will
not
generally
be
available
.
The
use
of
dualcase
OCRE
is
appropriate
only
in
properly
equipped
closed
networks
,
when
dualcase
receiving
teleprinters
are
generally
available
and
when
using
ASCII
(see
Figure
4
of
Appendix
B)

Single
Character
Set
OCRE
(Monocase)
.
The
use
of
monocase
character
set
OCRE
(upper
case
only)
has
the
disadvantages
of
necessitating
more
complete
standardization
of
message
preparation
typewriters
throughout
the
headquarters
than
does
OCRE
utilizing
dualcase
and
multiple
character
sets
.
However
,
monocase
OCRE
has
an
advantage
in
cost
and
reliability
of
reading
over
dualcase
OCRE
and
it
has
a
very
considerable
advantage
in
cost
and
reliability
of
reading
over
multiple
character
set
OCRE.
For
DoD
policy
and
guidance
on
fonts
,
refer
to
the
foreword
of
this
appendix
.
30.5.3.2
Multiple
Character
Set
OCRE
.
OCRE
having
multiple
character
set
capability
allows
more
flexibility
in
the
use
of
typewriters
but
it
costs
considerably
more
and
is
much
less
reliable
in
reading
than
the
single
character
set
OCRE
.
Multiple
character
set
OCRE
shall
have
the
capability
of
the
character
set
described
in
Table
I
and
subparagraph
30
,
5
,
4
of
this
appendix
.
30.5.4
Minimum
Character
Set
Capability
.
OCRE
shall
have
the
minimum
capability
of
reading
a
character
set
defined
by
Table
I
when
the
:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
Horizontal
character
spacing
is
10
per
inch,
Line
spacing
is
6

height
,
H
,
is
0.
094
inches
,
Maximum
character
width,
W,
is
0.
055
inches
,
and
Nominal
stroke
width
,
T
,
is
0.014
inches
.
The
character
height
and
width
are
defined
as
centerline
height
and
width
.
Therefore
,
the
actual
maximum
height
is
H
+
T
and
the
actual
maximum
width
is
W
+
T.
30.5.5
Multiple
Character
Set
Capability
.
One
of
the
character
sets
shall
be
as
described
in
subparagraph
30.
5.

of
this
appendix
.
All
other
character
sets
are
specified
only
to
the
extent
of
having
the
character
spacing
of
subparagraph
30
,
5,
4
of
this
appendix
.
30.5.6
Automatic
Message
Heading
(Optional)
.
OCRE
equipped
for
automatic
message
heading
generation
shall
read
the
heading
elements
which
are
typed
in
the
C
-2
MIL-STD-188-100
15
November
1972
appropriate
places
on
DD
Form
173.
Using
this
information
,
the
OCRE
shall
automatically
generate
an
appropriate
message
heading.
30.5.7
Automatic
Message
Ending
(Optional)
.
OCRE
equipped
for
automatic
message
heading
generation
shall
also
automatically
generate
a
compatible
and
appropriate
end-of-message
format.
30.6
Typewriters
.
30.6.1
General
Performance
Characteristics
.
Adequate
typing
quality
is
mandatory
in
order
to
minimize
OCRE
reading
errors
.
This
requires
appropriate
typewriters
,
ribbons
,
maintenance
,
and
a
consistently
strong
touch
.
All
of
this
can
be
obtained
most
adequately
by
using
electrical
typewriters
and
one
-time
ribbons
.
Making
such
practice
mandatory
will
pay
dividends
in
added
message
reliability
.
30.6.2
Dualcase
Typewriters
.
Dual
case
typewriters
shall
ordinarily
be
used
for
message
preparation
so
that
they
also
may
be
used
for
other
work.
The
lower
case
characters
may
be
any
suitable
style
unless
the
headquarters
is
equipped
with
an
OCRE
with
both
an
upper
and
a
lower
case
reading
capability
.
In
such
a
case
the
lower
characters
shall
be
the
appropriate
characters
as
provided
in
subparagraph
30.
5.
2
of
this
appendix
.
30.6.3
Monocase
Typewriters
.
Monocase
typewriters
shall
ordinarily
not
be
used
for
message
preparation
even
though
messages
normally
will
continue
to
be
prepared
in
upper
case
letters
only
.

Keyboard
Arrangement
.
The
detail
requirements
for
a
standard
keyboard
arrangement
for
OCR
typewriters
are
given
in
MIL
-STD-
1280
,
Military
Standard
Keyboard
Arrangements
.
30.7
Print
Quality
.
Print
quality
is
a
combination
of
the
following
:
Minimum
print
contrast
signal
(PCS)
within
character
outline
,
the
maximum
(PCS)
outside
the
character
outline
,
voids
,
extraneous
ink
areas
,
stroke
width
variation
,
and
conformance
of
character
shapes
to
nominal
character
shapes
specification.
These
factors
are
largely
determined
by
the
printing
systems
employed
.
The
performance
of
OCR
systems
depends
to
a
large
extent
on
the
print
quality
.
Hence
,
every
effort
should
be
made
to
provide
"good"
print
quality,
i
.
e.:
(a)
The
printed
character
should
present
as
high
a
contrast
as
possible
to
the
background
document.
(b)
Stroke
width
should
be
held
as
close
as
possible
to
the
nominal
.
(၁
)
Insofar
as
possible
,
there
should
be
no
voids
within
the
stroke
outline
.
When
these
cannot
be
prevented
,
the
number
of
void
areas
within
a
stroke
should
be
minimized
.
The
size
of
individual
voids
should
not
exceed
half
of
the
nominal
stroke
width,
and
the
distance
between
individual
voids
should
be
as
great
as
possible
.
(d)
clear
area
.
Insofar
as
possible
there
should
be
no
extraneous
ink
within
the
When
this
cannot
be
prevented
,
the
number
of
extraneous

be
minimized
,
the
size
of

should
not
exceed

,
and
the

,
starting
immediately
to
the

The
Info

are
indented
20

as
are
the

and
are
also
double

vertically
.
The

may
thus
recognize

by
the
typed
"

will
recognize
this

line,
no

,
using
double

from
the

If
there
be
more
than
one

,
the
second

shall
also
be
indented

.
Thus
,
the

allows
for

without
any
prearrangement
between
the
originator
or
drafter
and
the

.
When
the
ASCII
is
used
,
however
,
tabular
material
can
be
sent
by
prearrangement
between
the
transmitter
and

This
requires
sending
tabular
codes
rather
than

and
also
employing
appropriate

METHODS
40.1
Scope
.
This
Appendix
provides
general
measurement
techniques
and
methods
of
measuring
the
values
for
the
common
parameters
of
voice
and
data
service
specified
in
the
other
sections
of
MIL
-
STD
-
188-100
.
40.1.1
Purpose
.
Appendix
D
is
not
a
part
of
MIL
-
STD
-
188-100
.
It
is
provided
for
information
and
to
facilitate
understanding
of
the
parameters
included
in
the
standard
.
When
using
these
test
techniques
some
precautions
must
be
observed
so
that
satisfactory
results
may
be
obtained
and
,
in
some
cases
,
to
insure
the
safety
of
the
personnel
and
equipment
involved
.
Application
.
40.1.2
This
appendix
discusses
test
methods
which
are
common
to
all
voice
frequency
channels
derived
from
tactical
or
long
-haul
subsystems
.
It
is
essential
to
recognize
that
this
appendix
discusses
general
methods
of
testing
rather
than
step-by
-
step
procedures
for
performing
a
particular
test
.
The
latter
would
vary
considerably
among
the
many
different
equipment
configurations
which
exist
and
would
involve
a
level
of
detail
not
appropriate
to
an
appendix
of
a
general
standards
document
.
The
test
methods
discussed
herein
can
be
used
as
a
guide
to
develop
detailed
procedures
for
measuring
the
critical
parameters
for
voice
or
data
service
over
voice
frequency
channels
.
40.2
General
Measurement
Techniques
.
The
following
paragraphs
have
general
application
to
the
voice
frequency
test
methods
discussed
in
paragraph
40.3
.
40.2.1
Accuracy
of
Measurements
.
The
measurement
techniques
used
in
measuring
the
various
operating
parameters
of
long
haul
and
tactical
systems
should
be
devised
to
reduce
the
number
of
errors
which
can
contribute
to
the
final
accuracy
of
measurement
.
In
general
,
more
than
one
method
may
be
available
for
measurement
of
a
particular
parameter
.
The
method
which
results
in
the
least
number
of
errors
should
be
chosen
whenever
possible
.
For
example
,
insertion
loss
measurements
could
be
made
by
either
the
direct
method
or
by
the
comparison
method
(see
paragraph
40.3.1.4
)
.
In
the
direct
method
,
all
the
inaccuracies
inherent
in
the
equipment
contribute
to
the
overall
accuracy
of
the
test
,
while
in
the
comparison
method
the
inaccuracies
of
only
one
piece
of
equipment
(
i.e.
,
an
attenuator
)
contribute
to
the
overall
measurement
accuracy
.
Other
technical
and
economic
factors
may
have
significance
when
selecting
a
test
method
;
however
,
consideration
should
always
be
given
to
reducing
the
sources
of
measurement
error
.
The
following
sources
of
error
should
be
considered
:
a.
Impedance
Matching
Attention
must
be
paid
to
matching
the
sending
and
receiving
impedances
of
the
testing
equipment
to
the
nominal
input
and
output
impedances
respectively
of
the
system
or
network
under
test
.
D-1
MIL-STD-
188-100
15
November
1972
b.
Calibration
Improperly
calibrated
instruments
will
always
yield
measurement
errors
when
direct
reading
methods
are
employed
.
c.
Equipment
Errors
Equipment
errors
are
caused
by
many
factors
.
For
example
,
a
direct
reading
selective
level
measuring
set
will
be
subject
to
variances
in
level
indication
as
a
function
of
frequency
,
temperature
variations
,
and
attenuator
accuracies
when
switching
ranges
.
d.
Human
Errors
Human
errors
result
in
inaccuracies
which
can
easily
exceed
the
cumulative
inaccuracies
due
to
all
the
other
sources
of
errors
.
It
is
therefore
essential
that
test
personnel
become
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
test
equipment
and
the
system
under
test
.
Test
equipments
can
also
be
provided
with
numerous
features
which
reduce
the
possibility
of
human
error
,
e.g.
scale
calibrations
which
allow
for
easy
interpolation
.
40.2.2
Use
of
Digital
Displays
.
[NOTE
:
A
distinction
should
be
drawn
between
instruments
which
display
a
digital
representation
of
a
continuously
variable
quantity
(
e.g.
,
a
digital
decibelmeter
)
and
instruments
which
are
essentially
event
-
counters
and
thus
naturally
lend
themselves
to
a
digital
display
(
e.g.
,
an
error
-rate
counter
)
.
The
latter
are
not
the
subject
of
this
discussion
.
]
In
general
it
is
considered
that
the
use
of
digital
displays
is
desirable
for
some
(but
not
all
)
transmission
measurements
.
The
quantity
being
measured
should
preferably
be
steady
for
a
digital
display
since
it
is
more
difficult
to
form
an
estimate
of
the
rate
and
extent
of
fluctuations
of
a
varying
quantity
with
this
form
of
presentation
than
with
a
conventional
scale
-and
-
pointer
display
.
Digital
displays
would
be
suitable
for
non-
specialized
staff
,
but
economic
considerations
,
technical
complexity
,
and
the
possible
physical
size
of
portable
equipment
might
limit
their
extensive
use
.
Digital
display
instruments
can
be
used
for
measurements
requiring
the
highest
accuracy
.
Human
errors
are
reduced
and
(
for
a
given
cost
)
it
is
often
easier
to
make
a
digital
display
instrument
more
accurate
than
an
analog
display
instrument
in
that
the
least
-
significant
-
figure
error
can
often
readily
be
made
less
than
the
scale
error
of
a
conventional
meter
.
In
general
,
a
digital
display
takes
less
time
to
read
than
a
scale
indication
;
hence
,
digital
displays
would
be
superior
to
analog
displays
for
making
measurements
in
quick
succession
.
A
facility
for
a
printed
or
punched
output
might
be
provided
usefully
by
the
instrument
for
this
purpose
.
A
digital
display
is
not
considered
suitable
if
the
quantity
being
measured
is
varying
continuously
(as
,
for
example
,
when
the
level
of
a
signal
is
being
adjusted
with
a
potentiometer
)
and
for
this
type
of
measurement
a
conventional
pointer
and
meter
display
is
preferred
.
However
,
if
the
adjustment
is
made
in
steps
,
then
a
digital

would
be
satisfactory

Digital

instruments
are
,
in

,
not
considered
quite
so
suitable
for
localizing
sources
of
trouble
giving
rise
to
variations
in
level
as
analog
displays
although
they
might
be
used
for
such
a

if
there
was

.
They
are
not
considered
suitable
for

of

.
Digital

have
been
used
or
could
be
used
for
the
following
purposes
:
Automatic
recording
of

In

40.2.3
Direct
-Reading
Methods
Versus
Null
or
Comparison
Methods
.
(It
should
be
noted
that
many
types
of
digital
display
instruments
are
inherently
comparison
or
null
systems
,
the
accuracy
of
which
depends
on
the
longterm
stability
of
some
internal
reference
device
,
for
example
,
a
zener
diode
.
However
,
this
section
refers
to
comparison
or
null
methods
performed
manually
;
hence
,
digital
display
instruments
are
regarded
here
as
direct
-
reading
instruments
.
)
In
general
,
comparison
or
null
methods
requiring
the
operator
manually
to
adjust
a
control
should
be
used
only
for
measurements
requiring
the
highest
accuracy
(e.g.
,
measurement
of
crosstalk
ratios
and
noise
levels
)
.
Portable
instruments
could
use
this
method
with
advantage
in
that
the
stability
is
,
in
principle
,
vested
in
comparatively
robust
components
such
as
attenuators
,
rather
than
in
a
meter
.
In
general
,
direct
-
reading
techniques
are
considered
suitable
for
most
other
types
of
measurements
,
particularly
when
cost
or
time
must
be
conserved
.
Some
measuring
sets
capable
of
precise
measurements
combine
manually
-
operated
controls
with
a
direct
-
reading
instrument
.
These
are
the
so
-
called
"
level
lens
"
or
"
off
-
set
zero
"
instruments
in
which
,
for
example
,
the
input
level
being
measured
is
set
equal
to
within
say
±0.5
dB
of
the
reference
signal
by
means
of
switched
attenuators
,
the
least
step
of
which
is
in
this
case
1
dB
,
and
the
residual
difference
between
the
measured
signal
and
reference
signa
1
is
displayed
on
a
center
-
zero
decibelmeter
which
indicates
the
sign
as
well
as
the
magnitude
of
the
difference
.
The
level
measured
is
given
by
the
sum
of
the
attenuator
setting
and
the
meter
reading
.
The
meter
can
be
engraved
readily
to
permit
easy
interpolation
.
40.2.4
Use
of
Selective
Measuring
Sets
.
Selective
measuring
sets
are
necessary
when
the
wanted
signal
is
accompanied
by
other
signals
or
noise
at
relatively
high
levels
,
for
example
,
crosstalk
levels
.
Selective
measuring
sets
may
be
either
fixed
-
frequency
or
continuously
variable
.
Fixed
-
frequency
selective
measuring
sets
are
in
general
accurate
and
fast
and
tend
to
reduce
human
errors
.
However
,
they
are
restricted
in
use
and
it
would
be
costly
to
provide
a
great
variety
of
them
.
On
the
other
hand
continuously
variable
selective
measuring
sets
require
more
skill
to
use
and
sometimes
,
and
for
some
applications
,
they
are
not
so
accurate
or
so
fast
.

Compensating
for
the
Losses
of
Test
-Trunks
and
Test
Cords
.
A
broad
distinction
can
be
made
usefully
between
centralized
measuring
apparatus
(which
is
often
necessarily
remote
from
the
transmission
equipment
,
rack-mounted
measuring
apparatus
(which
can
be
installed
near
the
transmission
equipment)
or
mobile
measuring
apparatus
(which
can
be
brought
up
close
to
the
transmission
equipment
)
.
40.2.5.1
Centralized
Measuring
Apparatus
.
Examples
of
this
are
automatic
measuring
apparatus
for
circuits
,
etc.
,
or
centralized
measuring
centers
serving
remote
installations
.
In
these
cases
it
is
often
convenient
to
build
out
the
loss
of
the
test
-
trunk
or
test
-circuit
with
pads
or
amplifiers
,
sometimes
equalizing
if
necessary
,
and
off
-
setting
any
residual
loss
by
suitably
increasing
the
sending
level
or
the
receiving
sensitivity
so
that
the
measuring
instrument
effectively
indicates
the
level
at
the
remote
transmission
equipment
.
40.2.5.2
Measuring
Apparatus
Mounted
or
Brought
Close
to
the
Transmission
Equipment
.
In
this
case
,
the
preferred
technique
is
to
keep
the
testing
cords
as
short
as
possible
.
The
calibration
technique
can
often
be
arranged
to
allow
for
the
loss
of
the
test
cords
.
The
test
cords
should
be
short
compared
with
the
shortest
wavelength
within
the
spectrum
of
signals
being
measured
.
When
this
is
not
possible
,
a
test
lead
may
be
derived
which
is
effectively
decoupled
from
the
transmission
path
(for
example
,
by
means
of
a
test
hybrid
which
may
be
a
transformer
or
a
network
of
resistors
)
,
the
test
lead
being
properly
terminated
by
the
measuring
apparatus
.
In
these
circumstances
it
is
useful
to
arrange
for
the
test
lead
to
be
similar
in
composition
and
length
to
the
transmission
path
from
the
transmission
equipment
to
the
associated
distribution
frame
so
that
measurements
at
the
end
of
the
test
lead
are
as
if
they
were
made
at
the
distribution
frame
.

Apparatus
.
Testing
equipment
used
for
making
loss
or
gain
measurements
consists
basically
of
a
suitable
generator
for
providing
the
test
signal
and
a
measuring
device
for
measuring
the
level
of
the
received
signal
.
For
each
equipment
or
system
to
be
measured
,
the
generator
will
have
to
provide
a
test
signal
at
a
suitable
frequency
or
over
a
range
of
frequencies
and
over
an
appropriate
range
of
levels
.
The
measuring
device
is
basically
a
voltmeter
but
indicating
voltage
or
power
levels
.
The
measuring
equipment
will
usually
include
sending
and
receiving
units
to
provide
the
desired
sending
and
receiving
conditions
at
impedances
appropriate
to
the
measurements
which
are
to
be
made
.
40.3.1.4
Test
Methods
.
Two
methods
of
measuring
gain
or
loss
are
commonly
used
;
these
are
direct
-
reading
measurements
and
measurements
by
a
comparison
method
.
a.
Direct
-reading
measurements
For
such
measurements
the
network
or
line
N
to
be
measured
is
inserted
between
a
sending
device
G
and
a
measurement
set
M
(Figure
D-

)
.

In
practice
,
the
sending
device
G
simulates
a
constant
voltage
generator
of
known
source
e.m.f
and
impedance
.
The
prime
calibration
of
such
an
arrangement
in
the
field
is
maintained
with
reference
to
the
power
developed
by
the
generator
in
a
thermocouple
of
the
correct
impedance
.
The
measuring
set
M
is
used
to
make
a
direct
measurement
of
the
power
level
of
the
received
signal
at
the
output
of
N.
The
difference
between
the
sent
and
received
power
levels
is
a
direct
measurement
of
the
insertion
loss
or
ga
in
of
N.
The
generator
and
measuring
circuits
must
be
designed
and
used
to
give
the
appropriate
sending
and
receiving
impedance
conditions
.

terminal
impedances
are
equal
to
the
input
and
output
impedances
of
the
two
-
terminal
pair
network
.
b.
Loss
measurements
using
a
comparison
method
For
such
measurements
the
output
from
the
sending
device
G
is
connected
via
a
branching
network
to
provide
two
outputs
,
one
of
which
is
connected
to
the
network
N
to
be
tested
and
the
other
to
a
calibrated
attenuator
A.
At
the
receiving
end
a
measuring
circuit
M
is
used
to
compare
the
level
of
the
signal
received
via
the
network
under
test
and
via
the
calibrated
attenuator
(Figure
D
-

)
.

The
loss
of
the
attenuator
A
is
adjusted
so
that
the
same
level
is
indicated
on
the
measuring
meter
when
it
is
switched
to
either
the
network
or
the
attenuator
;
the
loss
of
the
network
is
then
given
by
the
setting
of
the
calibrated
attenuator
.
An
extension
of
this
method
can
be
used
to
measure
the
loss
of
a
circuit
or
system
where
the
two
ends
are
not
available
at
the
same
point
.
In
this
case
a
second
generator
is
required
at
the
receiving
end
of
the
circuit
under
test
.
At
the
sending
end
the
test
signal
generator
is
adjusted
to
send
the
required
frequency
at
an
appropriate
level
into
the
circuit
under
test
.
At
the
receiving
end
a
second
generator
is
used
to
send
the
same
frequency
at
the
same
level
into
a
calibrated
attenuator
.
The
measuring
circuit
is
used
to
compare
the
level
of
signal
received
via
the
circuit
under
test
and
the
signals
from
the
calibrated
attenuator
,
which
is
adjusted
until
the
two
levels
are
the
same
.
The
setting
of
the
calibrated
attenuator
then
gives
the
loss
of
the
circuit
under
test
.
It
should
be
noted
that
these
comparison
methods
do
not
require
the
use
of
a
calibrated
measuring
device
.
An
uncalibrated
indicator
of
appropriate
sensitivity
may
be
used
,
the
accuracy
of
the
measurements
being
a
function
of
the
accuracy
of
the
calibrated
attenuator
.
Due
regard
must
be
paid
to
the
sending
and
receiving
impedance
conditions
when
making
the
measurements
.
The
diagram
represents
the
simplest
-
and
at
the
same
time
most
usua
1
-
case
,
in
which
the
terminal
impedances
are
equal
to
the
input
and
output
impedances
of
the
quadripole
and
to
the
input
and
output
impedances
of
the

40.3.2.1
Applicability
.
The
methods
described
are
applicable
to
measurement
of
envelope
delay
distortion
of
a
circuit
or
channel
,
on
an
end
-
to
-
end
or
looped
basis
.
40.3.2.2
Principles
of
Test
.
A
technical
discussion
of
envelope
delay
and
envelope
delay
distortion
appears
in
Appendix
E.
The
methods
used
for
testing
this
parameter
utilize
commercially
available
test
equipment
specifically
designed
for
the
measurement
of
increments
of
envelope
delay
on
telephone
transmission
circuits
.
This
equipment
consists
essentially
of
a
transmitter
and
receiver
.
The
transmitter
supplies
a
variable
carrier
frequency
(c
)
(e.g.
,
in
the
range
200
Hz
to
4,000
Hz
)
modulated
with
a
frequency
(
f)
that
is
low
compared
with
the
lowest
carrier
frequency
present
.
The
receiver
accepts
the
modulated
wave
as
sent
from
the
transmitter
over
the
intervening
transmission
circuit
.
The
received
signal
is
demodulated
and
the
low
-
frequency
(f
)
envelope
recovered
.
The
phase
of
(
f
)
is
compared
to
a
reference
wave
of
frequency
(
f
)
and
the
phase
difference
between
the
two
is
indicated
on
a
meter
.
This
phase
difference
approximates
the
slope
at
frequency
(c
)
of
the
phase
vs
frequency
characteristic
of
the
circuit
test
and
,
hence
,
gives
a
measure
of
the
envelope
delay
at
the
selected
carrier
frequency
.
The
transmitter
carrier
frequency
can
either
be
adjusted
manually
throughout
the
frequency
range
of
interest
or
it
can
be
swept
over
the
range
by
an
internal
motor
drive
in
the
transmitter
with
envelope
delay
recorded
on
an
X-Y
plotter
at
the
receiver
.
By
either
means
a
plot
of
envelope
delay
vs
frequency
can
be
obtained
from
which
the
envelope
delay
distortion
can
be
evaluated
.
40.3.2.3
Apparatus
.
This
test
requires
a
delay
distortion
measuring
set
which
consists
essentially
of
two
units
:
(
1
)
A
carrier
oscillator
whose
frequency
(
c
)
is
adjustable
over
the
range
of
interest
(voice
frequencies
)
and
which
is
amplitude
modulated
at
a
low
frequency
(
f
)
by
a
modulating
oscillator
.
(2
)
A
phase
comparator
capable
of
indicating
the
difference
in
phase
between
two
signals
of
frequency
(
f
)
.
The
signals
can
be
derived
in
a
variety
of
ways
depending
on
the
specific
test
arrangement
.
The
comparator
may
be
implemented
in
either
analog
or
digital
form
and
may
involve
null
balancing
or
direct
readout
.
Item
(
1
)
is
the
sending
unit
and
(
2
)
is
the
receiving
unit
.
Where
they
are
co-
located
,
as
in
measurement
of
the
characteristics
of
lumped
constant
device
or
a
looped
test
,
direct
comparison
of
the
phase
of
the
transmitted
and
received
envelopes
is
possible
.
In
measuring
the
characteristics
of
a
communication
channel
on
an
end
-
to
-
end
basis
,
the
send
and
receive
points
will
be
separated
and
the
problems
of
providing
a
reference
signal
of
frequency
(f
)
at
the
comparator
arises
.
Alternate
means
of
satisfying
this
requirement
are
discussed
in
the
following
paragraph

1
Applicability
.
This
paragraph
applies
to
measurement
of
the
level
of
total
noise
and
single
tone
interference
on
a
voice
frequency
circuit
.
The
measurement
of
impulse
noise
is
covered
separately
in
paragraph
40.3.4
.
40.3.3.2
Principles
of
Test
.
Total
circuit
noise
includes
both
basic
noise
(fluctuation
noise
,
hum,
carrier
leak
,
etc.
)
and
the
interference
(crosstalk
,
intermodulation
,
etc.
)
arising
from
other
traffic
carried
by
the
communication
system
.
The
interfering
effect
of
noise
on
a
telecommunication
circuit
is
fairly
well
described
by
a
measurement
of
noise
power
level
which
is
specially
"
weighted
"
to
account
for
the
characteristics
of
the
telephone
set
,
the
voice
-
frequency
circuit
,
and
the
human
ear
.
The
required
attenuation/
frequency
characteristics
of
weighting
networks
have
been
developed
by
subjective
tests
.
The
two
principal
weighting
characteristics
in
current
use
are
CCITT
psophometric
weighting
and
C
-
message
weighting
.
Figure
D-
9
shows
these
two
weighting
curves
.
It
will
be
noted
that
both
heavily
attenuate
low
-
frequency
hum
.
Single
frequency
tones
have
a
substantial
disturbing
effect
on
the
user
.
The
measurement
of
the
level
of
interfering
tones
should
be
performed
in
conjunction
with
circuit
noise
tests
.
40.3.3.3
Apparatus
.
The
measurement
of
circuit
noise
requires
a
noise
measuring
set
consisting
of
a
true
rms
voltmeter
with
prescribed
attenuator
.
Single
tone
interference
is
best
measured
with
a
frequency
selective
voltmeter
(
FSVM
)
.
40.3.3.4
Test
Method
.
Briefly
the
measurement
technique
calls
for
the
use
of
a
noise
measuring
set
to
measure
the
total
noise
level
of
a
voice
frequency
circuit
and
a
FSVM
to
measure
single
tone
interference
levels
when
the
sending
end
is
terminated
in
the
circuit
input
impedance
.
The
test
configuration
is
shown
in

the
test
is

a.
Perform
an
accuracy
check
on
the
noise
measuring
set
.
This
may
be
done
using
an
audio
frequency
oscillator
with
a
calibrated
output
level
indicator
.
The
noise
measuring
set
is
connected
to
the
oscillator
and
,
for
a
given
weighting
scheme
,
the
readings
from
the
noise
measuring
set
are
compared
with
the
calibrated
oscillator
output
levels
.
The
following
is
an
example
of
this
technique
used
with
C
-message
weighting
:
Set
the
signal
generator
frequency
to
1000
Hz
and
the
output
level
to
-60
dBm
.
The
level
measuring
set
should
read
30
dBrnc
.
Change
the
signal
generator
output
level
to
-10
dBm
.
The
level
measuring
set
should
read
80
dBrnc
.
If
the
dBrnc
readings
differ
from
these
values
by
1
dB
or
more
,
the
level
calibration
of
both
instruments
should
be
checked
.
b.
Ensure
that
the
circuit
under
test
is
in
its
normal
operating
condition
and
that
the
system
is
carrying
traffic
(
i.e.
,
loaded
noise
test
)
.
C.
Terminate
the
transmit
end
of
the
circuit
with
an
impedance
equal
to
the
input
impedance
of
the
circuit
(generally
600
ohms
)
.
d.
Ensure
that
the
input
impedance
of
the
noise
measuring
set
matches
that
of
the
circuit
under
test
and
the
desired
weighting
network
.
e.
Connect
the
noise
measuring
set
to
the
receiving
end
of
the
circuit
as
shown
in
Figure
D
-
10
.
f.
Record
the
reading
of
the
noise
measuring
set
.
The
noise
measurement
so
obtained
may
be
referenced
to
the
Transmission
Level
Point
as
follows
:
(Noise

to
zero
level
)

40.3.4
Impulse
Noise
.
40.3.4.1
Applicability
.
This
test
provides
a
generalized
method
for
measuring
impulse
noise
on
voice
frequency
circuits
.
40.3.4.2
Principles
of
Test
.
Impulse
noise
is
comprised
of
short
spikes
of
energy
with
an
approximately
flat
frequency
spectrum
over
the
desired
bandwidth
.
The
impulse
noise
arises
from
switching
transients
in
central
offices
and
from
other
external
electrical
disturbances
which
are
inductively
coupled
to
the
circuit
.
Digital
signals
such
as
data
and
PCM
are
affected
differently
by
noise
than
are
analog
voice
signals
.
Thermal
noise
which
presents
an
annoying
hiss
to
the
human
ear
has
no
detrimental
effect
on
digital
signals
unless
the
ampliImpulse
noise
which
tude
of
the
noise
approaches
the
amplitude
of
the
signals
.
manifests
itself
as
audible
clicks
or
pops
on
voice
circuits
causes
almost
certain
errors
on
digital
circuits
because
of
the
high
impulse
amplitudes
.
Impulse
counters
have
been
designed
to
measure
impulse
noise
and
consist
of
a
weighting
network
,
a
rectifier
,
a
threshold
detector
,
and
a
counter
of
events
above
threshold
.
The
measuring
sets
include
a
timer
which
can
be
set
to
automatically
count
the
events
above
a
certain
threshold
for
a
fixed
time
interval
.
The
time
interval
and
the
threshold
level
can
usually
be
adjusted
.
A
choice
of
a
terminating
impedance
(600
ohms
)
or
a
high
bridging
impedance
is
also
a
common
feature
.
Simultaneous
measurements
using
several
impulse
counters
can
be
used
at
different
thresholds
to
obtain
information
about
the
distribution
of
the
magnitudes
of
the
impulses
.
Some
impulse
counters
have
this
multiple
feature
as
part
of
the
equipment
capabilities
.

Principles
of
Test
.
The
harmonic
distortion
in
a
telephone
channel
arising
from
the
non
-
linearity
of
its
gain
characteristic
is
predominantly
of
the
second
order
category
,
which
will
vary
approximately
as
the
square
of
the
test
tone
level
.
The
signal
source
used
for
testing
obviously
must
have
very
low
harmonic
distortion
if
accurate
results
are
to
be
expected
.
If
a
pure
single
-
frequency
test
signal
from
an
oscillator
is
applied
at
the
desired
level
to
the
system
under
test
,
any
harmonics
generated
within
the
system
under
test
due
to
its
non
-
linearity
will
appear
at
its
output
together
with
the
test
signal
(which
is
the
fundamental
or
"
first
harmonic
"
)
.
The
single
-harmonic
distortion
(for
any
single
harmonic
)
is
the
ratio
of
the
power
at
the
fundamental
frequency
to
the
power
at
the
harmonic
frequency
selected
,
expressed
in
dB
.
The
total
-
harmonic
distortion
is
the
ratio
of
the
power
at
the
fundamental
frequency
to
the
sum
of
the
powers
at
all
the
harmonic
frequencies
(
usually
only
the
second
and
third
harmonics
)
expressed
in
dB
.

Test
Methods
.
a.
General
This
discussion
applies
to
all
the
methods
described
in
subparagraphs
b
.
,
c
.,
and
d
.
Figures
D-
12
and
D
-
13
are
alike
except
for
the
measuring
sets
E
and
G.
The
impedance
R
is
normally
600
ohms
.
If
otherwise
,
suitable
impedance
matching
transformers
should
be
used
.
Oscillator
A
supplies
the
test
signal
to
the
attenuator
through
a
pair
of
resistors
(
e.g.
,
300
ohms
each)
to
limit
current
and
to
maintain
the
correct
circuit
impedance
when
very
low
or
zero
settings
of
the
attenuator
are
used
.
With
higher
attenuator
settings
,
these
resistors
are
not
necessary
but
it
is
good
practice
to
use
them
.
Allowance
is
made
for
these
resistors
when
adjusting
the
amplitude
of
the
test
signal
.
The
following
alternative
methods
can
be
used
at
the
sending
station
.
(
1
)
With
level
measuring
set
C
,
which
has
an
input
impedance
high
compared
with
R
,
the
oscillator
output
is
adjusted
to
read
+6
dBm
on
C.
This
results
in
0
dBm
at
the
attenuator
input
.
(The
oscillator
faces
an
impedance
of
2RL
,
so
that
the
oscillator
voltage
has
to
be
double
that
required
to
produce
0
dBm
across
600
ohms
.
This
will
read
on
C
as
+6
dBm
.
)
(
2
)
With
level
measuring
set
D
,
which
has
an
input
impedance
equal
to
RL,
the
oscillator
output
is
adjusted
to
read
0
dBm
at
D.
This
results
in
0
dBm
at
the
attenuator
input
.
(Because
of
the
symmetry
of
the
two
right
hand
branches
of
the
circuit
,
the
level
at
the
attenuator
input
is
the
same
as
that
measured
at
D.
)
Where
the
system
under
test
consists
of
transmitting
and
receiving
equipment
,
it
should
be
looped
through
suitable
attenuator
and
amplifier
equipment
as
required
to
allow
correct
system
line
-
up
.
b.
Single
Harmonic
Distortion
(Figure
D
-
12
)
The
selective
level
measuring
set
G
is
assumed
to
have
an
input
impedance
large
compared
with
RL
.
If
its
input
impedance
is
equal
to
RL
,
the
termination
resistor
marked
RL
should
be
omitted
.
The
selective
level
measuring
set
is
tuned
successively
to
the
frequencies
of
the
fundamental
(
i.e.
,
the
test
signal
normally
1000
Hz
)
and
of
the
second
,
third
,
etc.
harmonic
(normally
2000
and
3000
Hz
)
.
The
ratio
,
in
dB
,
of
the
power
of
the
fundamental
to
the
power
of
a
particular
harmonic
is
the
single
-
harmonic
distortion
for
that
harmonic
.
C.
Total
Harmonic
Distortion
(
Figure
D
-

)
The
method
is
the
same
as
for
single
harmonic
distortion
,
except
that
the
powers
of
the
2nd
,
3rd
,
etc.
,
harmonics
are
added
on
a
power
-
additive
basis
before
taking
the
ratio
of
fundamental
to
harmonic
powers
.
d.
Total
Harmonic
Distortion
(

-

)
The
distortion
measuring
set
is
assumed
to
have
an
input
impedance
large
compared
with
RL
.
If
its
input
impedance
is
equal
to
RL,
the
termination
resistor
marked
R
should
be
omitted
.
With
the
oscillator
set
to
provide
a
test
signal
(normally
1000
Hz
)
,
the
reading
of
the
distortion
measuring
set
in
its
broadband
condition
is
compared
with
its
reading
with
the
1000
Hz
rejection
filter
cut
in
.
This
gives
the
ratio
of
the

Frequency
Translation
.
40.3.6.1
Applicability
.
This
test
method
is
applicable
only
to
channels
derived
by
frequency
division
multiplex
methods
.
The
purpose
of
the
test
is
to
measure
the
frequency
translation
of
a
1
kHz
test
tone
transmitted
through
a
voice
frequency
channel
in
one
direction
.
Frequency
translation
is
defined
as
a
change
in
the
frequency
received
compared
with
the
frequency
transmitted
.
This
effect
is
due
to
lack
of
perfect
synchronization
between
the
master
oscillators
of
the
FDM
equipment
from
one
end
of
the
channel
to
the
other
,
including
any
intermediate
frequency
translations
.
No
method
is
described
for
measuring
frequency
translation
on
looped
FDM
equipments
,
since
if
both
the
transmitting
and
receiving
multiplex
equipments
are
supplied
by
the
same
master
oscillator
,
and
the
two
directions
of
any
given
channel
are
used
in
the
measurement
,
the
transmitting
frequency
displacement
is
exactly
equal
and
opposite
to
the
receiving
frequency
displacement
,
so
that
they
will
cancel
to
show
zero
translation
overall
.
40.3.6.2
Principles
of
Test
.
The
method
is
simple
and
direct
and
its
accuracy
depends
on
the
stability
of
the
test
signal
oscillator
,
and
the
accuracy
of
the
two
frequency
counters
.
A
frequency
counter
is
basically
a
device
for
counting
the
number
of
cycles
occurring
during
a
definite
time
duration
,
and
for
indicating
the
result
as
a
numerical
presentation
,
e.g.
,
1000.1
Hz
.
Obviously
the
accuracy
of
the
measurement
depends
on
the
accuracy
and
stability
of
the
time
interval
device
.
It
is
found
that
the
stability
and
accuracy
of
available
frequency
counters
is
adequate
for
the
purpose
.
The
test
consists
simply
of
applying
a
1000
-
Hz
test
signal
from
a
stable
oscillator
,
to
the
circuit
,
measuring
the
frequency
of
the
tone
simultaneously
by
two
frequency
counters
at
both
ends
of
the
circuit
.
The
magnitude
and
sense
of
any
difference
is
simply
obtained
by
comparing
the
readings
.

The

B.
At

,
the
channel
is
correctly
terminated

by
a

of

which
is
used
mainly
to
determine

Phase

results
from
phase
modulation
(or
variation
)
of
the
input
signal
as
it
is
processed
through
a
communications
system
.
As
the
result
of
phase
jitter
,
the
received
signal
will
consist
of
a
finite
frequency
signal
which
also
exhibits
rapid
incremental
changes
in
phase
angle
.
Large
instantaneous
changes
in
phase
of
a
single

signal
transmitted
through
a
voice
channel
are
defined
as
phase
hits
,
and
will
not
be
recorded
as
part
of
this
test
.
Data
transmission
at
1200
bits

second
and
higher
is
particularly
sensitive
to
phase
jitter
,
which
ranks
in
importance
with
impulse
noise
,
signal

-
noise
ratio
,
insertion
loss
versus
frequency
characteristic
,
and
envelope
delay
distortion
as
a
cause
of
channel

.
Formerly
,
measurement
of
phase
jitter
involved
use
of
an
oscilloscope
and
considerable
care
was
required
in
the
setting
up
and
use
of
the
equipment
.
Phase
jitter
meters
are
now
available
,
which
allow
these
measurements
to
be
made
more
simply
.

measures

and
can
be

.
Test

from
an

can
be

the

When

the

crosstalk
is

it

.
40.3.9.1
Applicability
.
In
testing
transmission
systems
,
input
and
output
impedance
are
measured
at
important
system
interfaces
.
In
addition
measurements
may
be
required
on
individual
items
of
equipment
prior
to
installation
,
i.e.
,
either
in
the
factory
or
in
the
field
.
The
various
sections
of
these
standards
specify
these
impedances
generally
as
a
return
loss
against
a
nominal
value
.
The
preferred
method
of
measurement
in
these
cases
is
a
direct
measurement
of
return
loss
as
described
in
paragraph
40.3.10
.
The
standard
bridge
method
of
impedance
measurement
described
herein
may
be
used
as
an
alternative
to
the
return
loss
measurement
.
Should
sections
that
specify
impedance
directly
be
added
to
these
standards
,
it
would
in
these
cases
be
the
preferred
method
.
Direct
measurements
of
impedance
can
be
used
to
obtain
return
loss
as
described
under
paragraph
40.3.10
.
Impedance
measurements
at
radio
frequencies
are
not
included
here
.
40.3.9.2
Principles
of
Test
.
This
method
uses
a
standard
alternating
-current
bridge
to
measure
the
impedances
.
Normally,
the
impedance
of
transmission
system
inputs
and
outputs
should
be
measured
at
the
test
tone
level
used
at
that
point
of
the
system
.
For
instance
,
the
input
impedance
of
a
standard
voice
channel
modulator
should
be
measured
at
a
test
tone
level
of
-16
dBm
.
This
is
assured
by
measuring
the
power
level
across
the
impedance
to
be
measured
.
Test
methods

40.3.11.2
Principles
of
Test
.
Because
a
transmission
patch
has
to
operate
in
the
real
world
,
it
can
never
be
entirely
isolated
from
the
electrical
influences
that
exist
there
.
The
line
may
be
exposed
in
different
ways
.
A
power
line
may
parallel
it
.
It
may
be
in
a
cable
or
wire
line
with
similar
circuits
paralleling
it
.
It
passes
through
central
offices
where
it
may
pick
up
substantial
transients
from
switching
equipment
.
It
is
necessary
to
consider
such
sources
of
interference
.
In
the
early
days
of
telephony
,
ground
-
return
circuits
were
used
,
but
with
the
rise
of
electric
power
lines
,
which
tended
to
followthe
same
routes
,
and
the
change
from
open
wire
to
cable
facilities
,
balanced
pairs
became
standard
.
The
great
advantage
of
a
balanced
pair
is
that
interfering
currents
induced
equally
in
both
wires
balance
out
.
By
illustration
,
Figure

the

transformers

The

current
flows
in
opposite
directions
on
the
two
wires
,
and
thus
passes
through
the
line
winding
of
the
right
-
hand
transformer
,
causing
current
to
flow
through
the
load
ZL
.
The
generators
in
series
with
the
two
wires
,
E1
and
E2
,
represent
an
interference
which
is
induced
by
an
external
source
.
The
currents
I1
and
12
flow
in
the
same
direction
and
,
if
they
are
equal
,
these
currents
will
cancel
in
the
balanced
windings
of
the
transformer
,
so
that
no
current
flows
in
ZL
.
The
term
"
metallic
circuit
currents
"
is
applied
to
the
currents
which
flow
in
opposite
directions
in
the
wires
of
the
pair
,
while
those
that
flow
in
the
same
direction
are
called
"
longitudinal
currents
"
.
If
there
is
any
difference
between
the
longitudinal
currents
in
the
line
winding
of
the
transformer
,
they
will
not
completely
balance
out
,
causing
unwanted
currents
to
flow
in
the
load
Zī
.
This
unbalance
may
be
due
to
a
higher
resistance
in
one
wire
than
in
the
other
,
such
as
a
bad
splice
.
Or
,
if
the
two
windings
of
the
transformer
are
not
perfectly
balanced
,
the
effects
of
the
two
parts
of
the
longitudinal
current
will
not
cancel
and
ZL
will
receive
unwanted
currents
.
The
degree
of
such
an
unbalance
is
measured
by
the
tests
described
in
this
paragraph
.

Input
Circuits
.
This
method
is
used
for
input
circuits
,
and
other
circuits
not
having
an
output
at
the
terminals
to
be
tested
.
In
the
circuit
shown
,
adjust
the
oscillator
to
the
desired
test
frequency
and
to
the
proper
power
level
for
the
apparatus
to
be
tested
,
as
read
on
voltmeter
C.
For
example
,
for
standard
voice
channel
multiplex
inputs
,
it
is
-16
dBm
.
With
the
frequency
-
selective
voltmeter
B
in
its
narrow
bandwidth
position
,
tune
it
to
maximum
response
at
the
test
frequency
used
.
The
use
of
a
frequency
selective
voltmeter
is
necessary
at
B
because
the
wide
bandwidth
of
an
ordinary
ac
voltmeter
may
allow
it
to
pick
up
common
mode
signals
other
than
the
low
level
imbalance
signal
.
The
difference
,
in
dB
,
between
the
reading
of
C
,
in
dBm,
and
the
reading
of
B
,
in
dBm
,
is
taken
as
the
longitudinal
balance
.
This
test
should
be
repeated
for
different
frequencies
over
the
audio
band
as
required
.
b
.
Output
Circuits
.
Check
the
output
circuit
to
make
sure
that
no
other
signal
is
present
,
as
it
would
interfere
with
the
results
of
this
test
.
Using
the
same
circuit
as
above
,
follow
the
procedure
described
for
input
circuits
.
In
this
case
,
the
test
signal
is
inserted
"
backwards
"
,
i.e.
,
into
the
output
of
the
channel
with
the
distant
end
terminated
.

Again
,
the
longitudinal
balance
is
the
difference
between
the
reading
of
C
and
the
reading
of
B.
For
example
:
if
C
reads
16
dBm,
and
B
reads
-56
dBm,
then
the
longitudinal
balance
is
40
dB
which
is
calculated
as
follows
:
Longitudinal
Balance
=
C
-
B
=
(-16

=

In
a
system
using
an
equal

in
a

)
,

INTRINSIC
NOISE
.
In
a
transmission
path
or
device
,
intrinsic
noise
is
that
noise
which
is
'
inherent
to
the
path
or
device
and
is
not
contingent
upon
modulation
.
INVERSION

.
opposite
state
.
The
deliberate
or
fortuitous
changing
of
the
state
of
a
bit
to
the
IONOSPHERIC
DISTURBANCES
.
Occasionally,
a
sudden
outburst
of
ultraviolet
light
on
the
sun
,
known
as
a
solar
flare
or
chromospheric
eruption
,
produces
abnormally
high
ionization
densities
in
the
D
region
.
The
result
is
a
sudden
increase
in
radio-wave
absorption
,
which
is
most
severe
in
the
upper
MF
and
lower
HF
frequencies
.
The
effects
on
the
critical
frequencies
and
heights
of
the
reflecting
layers
,
are
negligible
but
the
increase
in
transmission
loss
may
be
enormous
.
This
phenomenon
is
called
a
sudden
ionospheric
disturbance
(
SID
)
.
It
often
results
in
a
complete
loss
of
communications
,
and
its
effects
may
last
for
several
hours
in
severe
cases
.
Since
the
SID
is
produced
by
direct
ultraviolet
radiation
,
it
never
occurs
on
the
dark
side
of
the
earth
.
The
term
SID
is
used
to
describe
general
ionospheric
effects
of
this
type
of
disturbance
.
The
term
shortwave
fade
out
(
SWF
)
is
also
used
to
describe
ionospheric
effects
of
this
type
.

wave
to
determine
an
increase
or
decrease
in
relative
amplitude
.
The
decision

NOISE
,
EQUIVALENT
PCM
.
The
amount
of
thermal
noise
power
which
has
a
similar
effect
on
the
speech
quality
as
any
given
amount
of
quantizing
noise
.
One
method
of
measuring
equivalent
PCM
noise
consists
of
comparing
subjective
listener
tests
of
speech
received
through
two
parallel
audio
channels
.
In
one
channel
,
the
speech
is
transmitted
in
digitized
form
derived
from
PCM;
in
the
other
channel
,
the
same
speech
is
transmitted
in
analog
(non-
digitized
)
form
.
For
this
comparison
,
the
thermal
noise
in
the
non-
digitized
speech
channel
is
simulated
by
a
noise
generator
which
has
an
adjustable
noise
power
output
.
An
amount
of
thermal
noise
power
in
the
non-
digitized
speech
channel
can
be
determined
such
that
the
thermal
noise
has
a
similar
effect
on
the
speech
quality
as
the
quantizing
noise
which
is
generated
in
the
PCM
channel
.
The
amount
of
thermal
noise
power
determined
by
this
comparison
is
called
the
equivalent
PCM
noise
.
NOISE
FIGURE
(
NOISE
FACTOR
NF)
.
The
noise
figure
of
a
transducer
;
i.e.
,
radio
receiver
,
is
the
ratio
of
:
(
1
)
the
output
noise
power
to
(

the
portion
thereof
attributable
to
thermal
noise
in
the
input
termination
at
standard
noise
temperature
(
usually
290°
K
)
.
The
noise
figure
is
thus
the
ratio
of
actual
output
noise
to
that
which
would
remain
if
the
transducer
itself
were
made
noiseless
.
NOTE
:
In

PERTURBATION
,
PHASE
(

.
The
existence
of
this
phenomenon
has
long
been
recognized
by
telephone
transmission
engineers
;
however
,
due
to
the
relative
insensitivity
of
the
human
ear
to
this
form
of
channel
disturbance
,
relatively
little
attention
has
been
paid
to
it
.
Attention
is
called
to
this
phenomenon
because
of
the
serious
detrimental
impact
it
can
have
on
data
transmission
,
particularly
that
type
of
modulation
which
is
dependent
on
the
signal
phase
more
than
the
amplitude
or
frequency
.

,
Phase
Perturbation

Phase

is
defined
as
that
phenomena
which
,
from
causes
known
or
unknown
,
results
in
a
relative
shifting
(
often
quite
rapid
)
in
the
phase
of
the
signal
.
The
shifting
in
phase
may
appear
to
be
random,
cyclic,
or
both
.
It
is
noted
that
a
similar
phenomenon
related
to
amplitude
perturbation
exists
which
is
also
not
sufficiently
understood
to
be
acceptably
defined
at
this
time
.
The
amount
of
phase
perturbation
may
be
expressed
in
degrees
with
any
cyclic
component
expressed
in
hertz
.
The
instantaneous
relative
phase
may
or
may
not
be
significant
,
however
,
for
the
sake
of
clarity
it
should
be
assumed
a

perturbation
of
360

is
one
who
represents
the

measured
at
a
given
location

The
mean
is
the

TRANSMISSION
,
BITERNARY
.
A
method
of
digital
transmission
in
which
two
binary
pulse
trains
are
combined
for
transmission
over
a
system
in
which
the
available
bandwidth
is
only
sufficient
for
transmission
of
one
of
the
two
pulse
trains
when
in
binary
form
.
The
biternary
signal
is
generated
from
two
synchronous
binary
signals
operating
at
the
same
bit
rate
.
The
two
binary
signals
are
adjusted
in
time
to
have
a
relative
time
difference
of
one
-
half
the
binary
interval
and
are
combined
by
linear
addition
to
form
a
biternary
signal
.
Each
biternary
signal
element
can
assume
any
one
of
three
possible
states
;
i.e.
,
+1
,
0
,
or
-1
.
Each
biternary
signalling
element
contains
information
on
the
state
of
the
two
binary
signalling
elements
as
defined
in
the
following
truth
table
:
B1
B2
BITERNARY
1000
OOO0
+1
1
The
method
of
addition
of
B1
and
B2
as
described
above
does
not
permit
the
biternary
signal
to
change
from
-1
to
+1
or
+1
to
-1
without
an
intermediate
biternary
signal
of
0.
Since
there
is
half
a
unit
interval
time
difference
between
the
binary
signals
B1
and
B2
only
one
of
them
can
change
its
state
during
the
biternary
unit
interval
.
This
makes
it
possible
in
the
decoding
process
to
ascertain
the
state
of
the
binary
signal
that
has
not
changed
its
state
and
thus
avoid
ambiguity
in
decoding
a
biternary
signal
of
0

TRANSMISSION
LEVEL
.
The
transmission
level
(
TL
)
of
any
point
in
a
transmission
system
is
defined
as
the
power
(
in
dBm
)
that
should
be
measured
at
that
point
when
Standard

is

point
.
a
point
where
a
reading
of
-16
dBm
is
expected
would
be
a
"
-16
TL
point
"
,
sometimes
abbreviated
"
-16
TLP"
.
The
transmission
level
of
a
point
is
a
function
of
system
design
and
is
a
measure
of
the
design
(
or
nominal
)
gain
at
1000
Hz
of
the
system
between
the
chosen
reference
point
(known
as
the
Zero
Transmission
Level
Point
or
Zero
TLP)
and
the
test
point
in
question
.
Absolute
measurements
of
the
power
of
test
signals
at
any
point
are
influenced
by
the
expected
level
as
well
as
by
any
deviations
of
the
system
from
its
desired
gain
.
Since
field
measurements
are
usually
made
either
to
check
that
the
system
is
operating
properly
or
to
adjust
the
system
to
its
design
values
,
it
is
convenient
to
eliminate
the
fixed
effect
that
the
Transmission
Level
of
the
test
point
has
on
measurements
.
This
has
led
to
the
practice
of
"
referring
readings
to
Zero
Transmission
Level
"
using
the
formula
:
Measurement
referred
to
Zero
Transmission
Level
(in
dBmO
)
=
Actual
Measurement
(
in
dBm
)
Relative
Transmission
Level
of
the
Test
Point
(TL
)
A
measurement
expressed
in
dBmO,
therefore,
is
influenced
only
by
departures
of
the
system
from
its
design
value
.
For
example
,
if
a
power
of
-15
dBm
is
measured
at
a
-16
TLP
,
then
this
would
be
expressed
as
+1
dBmO
,
indicating
that
for
some
reason
the
system
has
1
dB
excess
gain
.
+1
=
-15
-
(
-16
)
It
is
often
desirable
to
introduce
a
test
tone
into
a
system
at
other
than
the
Zero
Transmission
Reference
Level
Point
.
In
this
case
it
is
usual
practice
to
introduce
the
test
tone
at
the
transmission
level
of
the
test
point
.
For
example
,
if
the
test
point
is
at
-16
TL
,
then
the
test
tone
power
should
be
-16
dBm
.
Note
that
in
this
case
the
-16
dBm
test
tone
is
actually
0
dBmO
at
the
point
where
it
is
introduced
.
In
similar
manner
,
noise
measurements
may
also
be
"
referred
to
Zero
Transmission
Level
Point
"
to
permit
measurements
made
at
different
test
points
to
be
readily
compared
.
For
example
,
a
noise
power
measured
at
35
dBrnc
at
a
+7
TLP
may
be
expressed
as
35

The
term
"

"
is
often
used
in

practice
,
having
the

meaning
as
"

,
the
two

characteristic
or
noise
weighting
characteristic
is
included
to
respond
to
amplitude

frequency
of
an
interference
voltage
and
permit
the
measuring
set
to
give
numerical
readings
which
approximate
the
interfering
effects
to
an
average
listener
using
a
particular
class
of

measurments
are
made
on

NOTE
:
The
noise
weightings
generally
used
were
established
by
agencies
concerned
with
public
telephone
service
and
are
based
on
characteristics
of
specific
commercial
telephone
instruments
representing
successive
stages
of
technological
development
.
The
coding
of
commercial
apparatus
appears
in
the
nomenclature
of
certain
weightings
.
The

weighting
nomenclature
and

weighting
,
for
use
in
a
noise
measuring
set
or
psophometer
.
The
shape
of
this
characteristic
is
virtually
identical
to
that
of

.
The
psophometer
is
,
however
,
calibrated
with
a
tone
of
800
Hz
,
O
dBm,
so
that
the
corresponding
voltage
across
600
ohms
produces
a
reading
called
0.755
volt
.
This
