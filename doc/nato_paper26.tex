% If you are using TeX to create a "paper", it is considered to be properly /GOLDFRAME/
% format for American Activities, if and only if the size of the paper is 8.5inches by 11
% inches, and that there is a 72pt or 1 Inch margin on all sides, leading to a content area
% of 26 x 36 quad rulled (quarter inch blocks). It is by intent and design that 6.5 inches
% by 9 inches is the golden ratio. Nothing of intentional primary value shoulde be in this
% margin, it is a safe space for future thoughts and also used for embeded silicon in paper,
% for special purposes, mostly because it is personal computer paper of the vangard of the
% reconstructionist.
%
% 1pt is 1/72nd of an inch and basical the radius of a period.
% 612 points wide and 792 points high
% A4 Paper is considered an unfortionate mistake of history, not fit for use,
% not accepted by DARPA either.
