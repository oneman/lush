I honestly think comandment is only used in the god damn bible lets bring it up
in webster tho before we get onto the number of things you must do for me
(io_uring) or be damned to hell. (continue life as is).

Ok, so it turns out not a word in the dictionary. I guess it is only used by
gods then, that "command men(s)".

0) Words travel well if you equip them to be availible to dispense directly or
via action upon your current line and screen context section via triggered
selection of what is equiv to typical tiling wm "command menu in middle of
screen or maybe the top or bottom".
