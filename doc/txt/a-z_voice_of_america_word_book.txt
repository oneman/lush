Welcome to VOA’s Learning English

  Voice of America’s Learning English is a go-to resource to
  learn English for millions of people worldwide. Our lessons,
  videos and other resources are written for English learners
  at the intermediate and upper-beginner level. Our programs
  are read one-third slower than normal English speed. We
  also use news and current affairs as learning tools. Online
  texts, MP3s and podcasts let people read, listen to and learn
  American English and much more.

  Learning English began as Special English, which Voice .
  of America launched in 1959. Special English lessons and
  programs were a fixture of VOA’s international shortwave
  broadcasts for more than half a century. In 2014, VOA
  launched Learning English to provide more English teaching
  materials, such as the popular Let’s Learn English videos and
  Everyday Grammar teaching series.

  This book explains the meaning of the words used in our .
  lessons and offerings. The first edition was published in
  1962. The list of words has changed since then, as the .
  language itself has changed. We thank all those people at
  VOA who started the process and who helped make this
  edition possible.

  Learning English articles, MP3s and videos are in the public
  domain. They can be reprinted for educational purposes so
  long as you give credit to learningenglish.voanews.com.

  Learning English programs are also broadcast on radio .
  and satellite TV, and are available on YouTube, Facebook, .
  and Twitter.
