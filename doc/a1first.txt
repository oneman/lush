Ok so here we are commiting to the super support project action initiative.

First we introduce the notion of a conceptual abstract specification (CAS) as
something that can be interpreted to mean something, and that is exactly the
same thing that is meaned by a yet-to-be-defined word or and existing well
known word or symbol or glyph or morpheme or en essense a smallest unit of
meaning and also everything constructed with, by and through such as all of the
written and recorded or transcribed documents inside the solar system.

It is useful to compare this to the set of such documents outside the solar
system, but why that is useful is not yet well understood. dog is like git
cat-file for its own output, it rips blobs into bitstrings to the furthest
extent to witch those bitstrings can be inter-related as useless or useful
conceptually, for example a small blob maybe a single bitstream of a single
number. However a pdf or a png image can be broken into quite a many
bitstreams.
