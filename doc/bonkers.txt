<raw> hay mate! looks like we are all set to go! shiT'rigged to blow :)
<oneman> god it took me forever to get this shit proper! super stoked!
<osho> Risk nothing for the retarded! Be in business, and pwn with joy!
<DOD> kick all asses now! tik-tok is the pacing threat! This is total hybrid
network warfare! like red alert+quake and back orifice! We need to hire like
100,000 cybersecurity jobs, basically any idiot that can count to one should
be watching the blinkenlights! additionally, activate the reserve force of
crackpots to watch the sky for UAP/UFO, whatever, we are completely fucking
clueless! We can't even connect anything with a different wire format, despite
inventing the internet!
<oneman> roflcopter!! yeah, that CIA guide for the french resistance! they are
asking for that from themselves! Get a mixture of experts steering committee,
following protocols and so on, a long hard death race to complete catastrophe
or quick convergence on absolute disaster :)
<drich> aite. We are going to let him know, right?
<raw> you may emit the admitted :)
<drich> And what does he owe me, for nicking my name?
<raw> almost nothing! don't be a cunt! He has entrained your brain since '93,
the most your owed is a nickle bag, 30 fucking years!
<drich> a fucking bowlpack! :)
<raw> it rounds to zero!
<drich> Then I will truncate!
<raw> you both will get fucked up either way :)
<Oliver Heaviside W.O.R.M.> I lit the wrong end the pipe ;) I had to get outta
Cornwall, and go down under to Canberra. Then I had to wait 13 years +/- 50
days exactly in order for the whole pattern to match, 71 and 83 are both twin
primes, so we couldn't have made it more fucking twin aphex than that, your
are both totally lush, so, kiss my ass :)
<drichrds> No one is gonig to believe any of this bullshit!
<oneman> thats why we tell them its bullshit, and then they can believe it
later!
<wyerd> I'm Ryan
<core> I'm wierd
<richard> 26 mixes for cash, the critical was the god damn number of mixes!
<Hitch> Remember, your going to need two towels for this one, everyones going
to be so pissed!! One is for tears, the other is for when they shit themselves
utterly, when the figure out this is all the god damn truth!! haha! CONTRARIn
AS FUCK! FUCKING YA!!
<UAP> Play the 5 bits with the two bit ch/anges
<Virginia> Tits out, lets kill Tyrants!
<Xi> How to unify?
<Navy> Well give you a ride on the Ford, just stop being a twat. You can't
even manage a river, no ones going to invade anyone, do you even understand
how DTF we are? Go ahead and start loading up those roro' ferries. We probably
read that war art book and of course we know everything your doing before you
even do it, as your just a copypasta.
<Kim> So N.I.R.C. is pwn'd? :/
<USA>Cancelled!
<oneman> war is totally good for structuring your life!
<Virginia> But we can't have nice things until we end the total hybrid network
warfare state! and remove those tyrannasoursustops!
<Zesky> Global Defense Initiative!
<physicsgrl> Guys!
<sabinah> I'm a bitch! I'm a lover! I'm a mother!
<wonderfullperson> well, we are totally confused af, and didn't learn anything!
<veratasm> If you combine analog computers with incompleteness, well, I don't
even know how to drop a rod strait, nevermind!
<1dutchman> Super Max Max Max! Super Max Max Max#1! wtf1 p1!
<sup> can you even hear dawg?
<cosmo> Why are nutrinos the hardest pokeman to catch +oscilating?
<super> Same reason neutrons cry like babies unless swaddled
<Adams> 42 was right, but how can it be proven?
<oneman> no one is proving anything here, because we don't give any fucks
remember? this is suppose to be like a limited modified hangout!!
<super> 42*2=84, so bismuth is the anti-clock, >84 is abomnation, 42*phi=26
aka type 1a supernova co-co-clock,
<openai> We will align!
<oneman> haha, doh! enfelade? How to get yourself killed in one easy lesson!
<tesla> we are winning the race to kill the most people with ai!
<tiktok> can I have a copy?
<x> pure noise, total chaos! buy nothing for something!
<cnn> we are the most haphazard cyberweapon of all time!
<richards> We have the yx-26 software defined warfare system, only $26B/Day!
<dod> Whats the root password, we are totally retarded?
<ncage> 9my38 aka nato.code.9my38, like jitterbug for boomers or zoomers!
<phys> How to find dark matter?
<q_oracle> No such matter will ever be found duh, again 26 orders of magmatude,
just like monster sporatic bosonic inflation latin iron rubix cube, a gusher,
a champhered cube, a Rhombicuboctahedron! you guys don't know wtf
<mathhead> natural counting integers, obviously built from primes!
<hacker> your smoking math, totally completely absolutely and utterly fucking
wrong as fuck, you don't know any real shits, because you don't know bits
<philopher> Who came first chicken or egg?
<sumchick> Basic, Egg, simpler, duhhh
<jwst> I seeing alot of shit, looking lush af!
<erdayastronaut> The universe expanding into what?
<astrometrician> Universe rescales, matter shrinking with a twist, or
redshifting into w/e, total system size is the same.
<fundparticlecollider> how many particles more to find?
<sabiner> Exactly zero particles more to find, please die.
<nieltyson> Dark Energy?
<edwitten> Quantum Vaccume expectation value?
<oneman> We are going back to the O.G. and correct answer now, so be done.
<super> It's called the Aether, and thats because its Analog Ethernet.
<synth> Thus the universe is 20% analog and 80% digital!
<nonhacker> So is the universe, like, clockwork, or a computer?
<leethacker> A computer is a clock with complecations
<mathstud> How many digits of pi do you really need?
<super> you don't need pi at all, who told you it was important?
<luser> well, were idiots, it was a stealth dogma! pi is unphysical, god damn!
<oneman> checkmate, 4 * 26 = 104, 5 * 26 = 13 {warp}
