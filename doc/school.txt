this series of letters considers itself understood by those who read it in a
countably finite number of relevant ways that the reader shall decide to
reveal to any particular ambulating topological locutionary threat actor
that is observed with a cluestick smaller than a toothpick. The topologists
shall be informed that they are under effective topological binding arrest, and
they should be very concerned by what that means for them because they are
certainly under the observation by special intelligence agents that defected to
a well defined kool-aid/cargo cult. (A multimodal wake up call, in five words.)
The definition is D.I.Y. make your own kool-aid, this is just any drink you
make for yourself that is served in standard atmospheric presure in an
environment you can refactor at will, and at net 3^5.1-3^5.26 kelvin, more
or less half often closer to 3^5.13K than to 3^5.26K. Anyway if your still cool
headed and considered approximately collected, then you did it yourself and it
was well done, if and always if you admit it. You are arrested, but not to
worry, its only a partial fractional crystalization, no isolation, no shame,
but the mistakes you make will be considered by a certain commitee. So in the
cult a bit of a wierd culture, but its just a very mild curable phase change,
its like getting a tatoo, if a tatoo was a virtual brain chip implant that
disables your ability to deligate comprehension, because its causing you to be
effectivly retarded and mentally retarded by incompletely defective disability.

You will never know when to stop because you don't know what your doing.
